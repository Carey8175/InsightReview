The only way I could get any sort of volume was to go the salon and get a blow out which, for obvious financial reasons, I can't do every day.

The hollow barrel is ceramic coated for better heat conduction without the extra damage to your hair you get from a metal barrel. The bristles are plastic but flexible and keep your hair smooth amd shiney. As a fun bonus, I adore the color! The set of 3 give you 1-1/4&#34;, 1-3/4&#34; and 2&#34; sizes. It also comes in an aesthetically pleasing box that is perfect for wrapping if this is intended as a gift.<br />If you don't know how to use a round brush I suggest looking up some tips. I was making it much harder than it needed to be! Biggest tip, don't try to do a blowout on wet hair! Your hair should be damp at best, like 80% dry.

The downside of using coconut oil as lotion is that usually you have to dig and scrape at it and then warm the hard oil in your hands to melt it before you can apply it. That problem is now extinct with this fractionated coconut oil! Just pump it out and apply! And one pump goes a long ways!<br />This form of coconut oil also comes in very handy when giving massages. When before, if I wanted to use coconut oil for a massage, I would have to heat up some in order to melt it, now I can just pump some from this bottle! This is especially convenient when I have to go elsewhere to give a massage and I don't have any means to heat my oil.<br />I'm glad that I have this fractionated coconut oil, it has made life a bit easier, especially when I am in a hurry.

Sitting in the hot tub under the starry night with the jets on and all the steam rising off the water smells of lavender.  Put a glass of wine in my hand and that's what I call a perfect night!<br /> I cannot testify that it makes me sleep better because I have an infant son that is doing his best to keep me from sleeping.

There are a few more features on the 8140XL -- the charging stand and full charge LED -- but basically Norelco makes a decent electric shaver.

I have taken it on a week-long business trip without bringing the charger.<br />Downsides:<br />1) $45 for a set of replacement blades is high. However, after a year, the original blade set is still adequate.<br />2) A \"needs charging\" LED would be useful.<br />Note that my shaver gets relatively light usage -- my beard is not overly thick, and I use a Gillette blade after not shaving over the weekend -- a blade gives a much quicker and better shave on a couple days' growth.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Miracle in a tube! This works when nothing else will! Amazing!!!", "text": "Just bought my 2nd pack of 3 tubes so I won\u2019t run out anytime soon\u2026 this is a MIRACLE product for severely chapped lips, and it\u2019s safe for sensitive skin!<br /><br />I have rosacea, and my skin is extremely sensitive. I\u2019ve had to stop wearing cosmetics, and my skin routine has felt like a part time job. I also have several allergies, and the antihistamines I have to take make my skin/lips even more dry. I\u2019ve apparently become overly sensitized to ingredients in 95%+ of commercial lip balm products, \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients/products. No matter how much water I drink, very healthy diet, hyaluronic acid supplements & topical hyaluronic acid + occlusives, running a humidifier, staying indoors, etc., nothing has helped the severe, painful peeling of my lips for the past 3-4 years. It\u2019s been embarrassing and has made talking, eating and drinking an uncomfortable and painful.<br /><br />Everything I tried seemed to make this even worse, so I eventually gave up on lip balm. I tried \u201cnothing,\u201d (just to see if I actually needed lip balm- that was a mistake!). I resorted to trying single ingredient options, just to help identify what the problem ingredient might be: testing by applying only straight argan, olive, safflower or squalane oils (messy, shiny, and doesn\u2019t last without an occlusive layer added on top), straight manuka honey (messy, sticky, expensive and only made me want to lick my lips all day lol). Made my own manuka honey, argan oil and beeswax product (worked pretty well but oh so messy, time consuming to make).<br /><br />Finally gave up on that and was only able to use Vanicream ointment (dermatologist recommended and similar to Vaseline but without the petrochemical odor- I can\u2019t use products like Vaseline or Aquaphor FWIW). But even that wasn\u2019t working well because i needed to be SO careful not to apply too much, or the ointment would eventually  migrate onto my face (usually while sleeping), which would cause rosacea flares (heavy occlusives seal in moisture but can also trap in just enough heat to cause a rosacea flare).<br /><br />But that messy solution that only stopped **some** of the peeling temporarily, and never resolved the issue entirely. Even applying every hour on the hour didn\u2019t make much of a difference. My lips were still chapped feeling/peeling every day, just slightly less chapped.<br /><br />But THIS STUFF IS WHAT ALL LIP BALMS ARE MEANT TO BE! I am not exaggerating when I say that within an hour or so after applying this for the first time, I noticed my lips didn\u2019t feel rough any longer\u2026 for the first time in YEARS!!! Weird, right?!! I didn\u2019t believe it could be possible at first, but it\u2019s truly  like I\u2019ve never had chapped, peeling lips. Miracle in a tube!<br /><br />This must be what Goldilocks looks for when her lips are chapped: It doesn\u2019t burn. It doesn\u2019t sting. It doesn\u2019t taste weird. It\u2019s not too shiny or greasy feeling. It just makes my lips feel smooth and soft. You can faintly taste the elderberry/manuka honey when applying but it doesn\u2019t linger. It\u2019s not overpowering or flavorful enough to make you inadvertently lick your lips, which I always seem to do with \u201cyummy\u201d lip balm products.<br /><br />It just works. My grad school student son also loves it for the same reasons. It just makes your lips feel and look like lips are supposed to feel and look like. It\u2019s long lasting, and when it does eventually lwear off, you won\u2019t get that \u201crebound dryness\u201d you might get from products like Eos, Chap-Stick and Burt\u2019s Bees.

Tupelo Honey lip balm for a while and it\u2019s the BEST I\u2019ve ever used! But it\u2019s hard for me to find locally, so this was a score! My lips have always gotten severely chapped no matter how much water I drink, no matter what I do. I take medications that make my mouth and skin feel dry, so fighting chapped lips is  a never-ending battle. I\u2019m never without at least one tube of lip balm within arm\u2019s reach!<br />I\u2019ve used almost every non-petroleum based \u201cpremium\u201d lip balm out there, and I\u2019ve tried coconut oil, Shea butter, lanolin, you name it. I\u2019ve been settling for Burt\u2019s Bees and Dr. Bronners, both of which feel pretty good but don\u2019t seem to last very long.<br />This is the first lip balm I\u2019ve tried in 40+ years that seems to actually work! It goes on much more smoothly, tastes *really* good but isn\u2019t overpowering at all, and actually helps keep my lips soft! Finally!!!<br />For anyone wondering, the key lime flavor is really good! I\u2019d never tried it before, but since I love key lime pie, I took a chance. It really does taste like key lime! Not overpowering or artificial tasting and seems to work just as well as the Tupelo honey flavor.<br />The seller shipped this quickly, and with a nice personal touch. Thank you so much!

I saw this next to another brand and it was a bigger size for the same price, so I decided to give it a try.  I really love this lip balm.  I live in Florida so the sun (especially in summer time) can blister my lips if they aren't protected.  I also get really chapped lips in the winter from the dry air, so I basically use lip balm year round.  The lip balm goes on silky smooth and smells amazing.  I don't know if it is flavored because I avoid licking my lips, because that just chaps them more and makes the situation worse. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a pain to get the stick to move up when you twist the bottom.  You kind of have to fumble with it for a minute or two and put forth more effort then you need to. Other than that, I love it and have purchased the vanilla chai for my purse and the pomegranate for my desk at work.

The patchouli scent is there, but it doesn't smell like a busload of hippies just past by. The charcoal seems to help keep the scent in check. So what you end up with is a nice musky, woodsy smell that isn't overpowering.<br /><br />When opening the package, a little moisture control packet was included with it... you know, those little &#34;do not eat&#34; things. Also, this is a large bar of soap! This was a really fresh piece of soap as it was practically starting to melt in my hand. I actually let this sit out on a metal rack for about 3 weeks to cure. Again, this is a huge piece of soap so after that drying period, I cut it in half for use. The charcoal has little scrubby bits in it, but they don't hurt my sensitive skin. Also, the soap itself is rather mild so it doesn't make my skin break out either. This melts slowly, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck. It cleans your skin nicely and also leaves you feeling moisturized. After showering, the smell gets a little bit sweeter, definitely not candy sweet, but a little lighter, softer and stays on you for a while afterwards.<br /><br />This is a great piece of soap if you like outdoor, woodsy, earthy kinda scents. If you're looking for candy sweet or citrus, you will be severely disappointed.<br /><br />FYI: When I bought this a few months ago, the name of this product was &#34;Patchouli Charcoal&#34; but this is the link along with this product so I believe that they just changed the name of the product :) Also, I didn't get ANY type of deal on this for my review...

You put it on at night and your skin drinks it in. You can almost feel your skin getting softer if that makes sense. By morning, my skin feels and looks fresher, brighter, hydrated and alive! This is a sample size from Sephora but I am sold on this product and I WILL be getting the full size!! I love that it\u2019s a once a day creme too so it will last that much longer.

I noticed that some reviewers were not pleased with the glimmersticks gooey consistency.  What I do to reduce the pliability so I can dry etch the color onto my eyebrow is I allow the stick to dry out a bit by removing the cap for a day.  This way it is not quite so sticky and gooey, and more like a crayon consistency that etches very nicely onto my brow without leaving tiny particles or gooey globs.  They also hold up longer this way and the tip remains sharp as well instead of rounding out.  Otherwise if the stick is right out of the wrapper I have to be extremely cautious about applying too much or making it look 'clownish' and less natural.  These sticks can also be used as eye liners if they are not allowed to dry out a bit because they are so pliable.  But I do adore this perfect color for my blonde hair and accents, so I simply dry them for a day, then use them like an eyebrow pencil that doesn't glob or goo on, and I'm a happy camper!

That being said, a product like this that would help hold the wave throughout the day and tame the &#34;wildness&#34; is desirable. Unfortunately, this has not worked for me as it is advertised.<br />There isn't enough salt to hold the hair in place. Instead of a subtle stiffness to hold the 'beach wave', my hair appeared a droopy, greasy mess that looks like I'd slept in a frying pan (with leftover bacon grease) rather than the just-off-the-surf look that I was anticipating.<br />Everyone's hair is different, so perhaps this product works better for others. My hair is long and thick. I would think that this may work better for people with shorter hair where gravity isn't fighting with the product all day.<br />Okay, so why did I give this more than one star? IT SMELLS AMAZING!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent product!", "text": "When I first used this shaver there were a few things I had to learn.  It's quiet -- so quiet, I thought it wasn't working properly.  Second, you don't have to press hard to get it to work -- just keep passing it over any area of your skin requiring extra attention and it will do the job.  Third, the lotion/gel samples make the shave live up to its name of Cool Skin -- no razor burn whatsoever.<br /><br />I have two issues with the shaver.  First, Norelco still has one of the most inconvenient methods of cleaning I've ever seen.  Every few days you need to disassemble the blades from the discs holding them and using a brush (I use an old toothbrush) to get the old hair out of there.  Rinsing it under water doesn't do anything but remove the stray hair stubble in the head itself.<br /><br />Second, the refills are difficult to find.  They are relatively expensive in most sources (including here at Amazon) but are available at the world's largest retailer in a box of 5 for $4.94.  I find they last about 10 days if you don't go crazy pressing the button for lotion.  I also find the lotion much better than the gel.  When I shave at home, I just use regular shave gel with it to preserve the expensive cartridge-based lubricants.", "images": [], "asin": "B0001HYKBC", "parent_asin": "B0001HYKBC", "user_id": "AHADOV6ZTMZD6QWITVP3VWXMWRZQ", "timestamp": 1168356563000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I probably have 80 pieces all together now, that way your not having to wet the entire soap bar, and you cut down on the waste. I placed them in a sandwich bag (that barely closes).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "TARTE IS THE VERY BEST", "text": "I have used \"Tarte Shape Tape Hydrating Foundation\" since it first came out and have loved it. Tarte has done away with the 'Shape Tape Foundation' and has replaced it with..... \"Face Tape Foundation.\"<br /><br />I tried the \"Face Tape Foundation\" which is somehow a blend of the 'matte' and the 'hydrating' Shape Tape Foundation formulas.  It didn't do well for me.  It did not seem to cover as well, and it didn't give my skin that airbrushed glow and look.  It was ok, but wasn't superior to other foundations on the market like the Shape Tape Hydrating Foundation was.<br /><br />I am a Baby Boomer and have dry skin that has lines and some wrinkles. The Hydrating Foundation really made my complexion look very good. It has become more and more difficult to find my shade in the Hydrating Formula which is 29B.  Now that I can no longer find it, I decided to try the Shape Tape Matte Formula in shade 29B.<br /><br />I see from other reviews that the Matte Formula can be very drying, settling into pores, wrinkles and lines.  When I wore it, it felt like it literally sucked the moisture right out if my facial skin, leaving it almost painfully dry!!!<br /><br />I have discovered a way to sidestep that and make this look and feel just as nice as the Hydrating Formula.  Under my moisturizer, I apply a thin layer of Argan Oil. Then after a couple of minutes I apply my moisturizer. Then I apply \"Tarte Base Tape PRIMER.\"  This primer is amazing and seriously the best I've ever used.  It is amazing how it makes the Matte Formula look and feel as nice as the Hydrating Formula. It leaves your skin feeling so supple and moist, but not oily.<br /><br />I'm thrilled I can still find the Tarte Shape Tape Foundation in my shade, even in the Matte Formula.  With the benefit of argan oil and the superior Tarte Base Tape Primer, the problem has been resolved.<br /><br />I will buy a few more bottles of the Shape Tape Foundation, Matte Formula while I can.  It's the absolute BEST foundation I've ever used.<br />Thank you Tarte!!  (Tarte also makes the very best concealer ever made....\"Tarte Shape Tape Concealer\", still available and in production).<br />\u2698\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc95", "images": [], "asin": "B079PH1X65", "parent_asin": "B079PH1X65", "user_id": "AGAW7JQ76547R6P7PTS2YSX6SSOQ", "timestamp": 1569574719833, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Ok brush at this price point.", "text": "I noticed some other reviews talking about the brush being dirty when they received it.  Mine didn't seem to be although I did shampoo it once before I used it.  I have a couple other brushes in this price range.  The brush head seems to be the same size and consistency of my other two brushes.  The handle is a little shorter than one (same length as the other) and narrower/thinner than the handle on both my other brushes.  Not horrible but just a little smaller than I was used to.  The first couple times I used the brush it did shed maybe 5-6 bristles each time. But that number dropped off drastically and after a couple weeks of use it might loose a bristle every second or third use.<br />One thing I was happy about was that the complete brush not seems well seated/anchored in the handle.  Every other brush i have bought the whole brush head loosened almost immediately and within a couple weeks came out. So i'd have to break out the Gorilla Glue and repair.  But this brush seems solid.<br />The brush works up a decent lather although it is not as easy or as voluminous a lather as my favorite brush and i'm not sure why.  The brushes seem very similar.  My best guess is the Beau Brummell doesn't seem to retain moisture as well as my other brush.<br />All in all it is a good brush and a great brush for the price.<br />Please note that I received this brush at about an 85% discount with the stipulation that I write a review.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 19, 2015:  So its now been about two months of using this brush about 3-5 times per week.  And lately it has been shedding like crazy.  Every time I use it I end up with 5-10 loose brush hairs stuck in my shave cream jar or on my face.  At this rate it will need rogaine soon.

A brush with handle seemed like the obvious choice.<br /><br />The first one I bought had bristles on it and it was so hard it hurt to use so I couldn\u2019t even bear the discomfort on my back. That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It\u2019s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it\u2019s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It\u2019s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn\u2019t any exfoliating action. I wouldn\u2019t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It\u2019s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth.

It has a sticky feel coming out of the bottle (mine came with a dropper rather than a pump), and it feels a bit odd going on -- sort of like rubbing mayonnaise into your skin. But then it absorbs well and leaves my skin a bit tighter and smoother. One reviewer has perfectly described the effect as akin to putting on pantyhose -- everything just feels held together nicely.<br /><br />I can't honestly say I will re-order this, because I use a pore refiner that does a better job of leaving my face makeup-ready, and Vitamin C serum seems to leave my skin clearer and nicer.

For me...meh.<br /><br />For starters, this feels greasy on my skin and takes longer than other moisturizers to absorb. Certainly, it is an &#34;okay&#34; moisturizer, hence the three stars. (&#34;It's okay.&#34;) But for me, it's sure nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I very much like the flip-top tube -- very quick and easy to open and dispense with one hand. The texture is nice. And I do appreciate the absence of scent. But an hour after I've applied it, my face feels no different than itI did before I put it on.<br /><br />Having said that, I will say that I have researched the use and effects of ceramide on skin, and it does seem that, in certain strengths and when used with certain other ingredients, ceremides can help skin retain moisture. So, this product will work for some people. It just doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />This product is not overly expensive, which helps, but there are a number of lower-priced moisturizers that I believe most people would find just as good as (or perhaps better than) this one. I can't recommend it as a great moisturizer, and I honestly don't know how it gets such terrific views, but that's the nature of skin care: what works for some doesn't work for others.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This is one fine product!", "text": ".<br />I ordered this makeup primer because I had been using Eclipse Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple of months and loved what it was doing for my face -- leaving it much brighter -- and I hoped that the foundation primer would work as well as the serum. And it does!<br /><br />I have used at least a half-dozen foundation primers over the years. I find that they not only help with foundation application, they also help foundation look better and last longer. For a couple of years now, I've used Avon's Magix Face Perfector, which is a reasonably priced, fine product. Having now used Eclipse Foundation Primer, though, I have a new favorite.<br /><br />For starters, this product goes on and absorbs into the skin with amazing ease. It comes out of the container in a semi-solid state and then just melts as I rub it into the skin. After letting it sink in for a minute (it doesn't take long), I'm ready to apply foundation, which then goes on smoothly and evenly. Applied over this primer, my foundation is more consistently even, which looks very nice. And with the foundation being smoother on the face, my blusher and powder apply more smoothly and evenly, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the Eclipse primer is the way it helps me go without foundation altogether! It makes my skin feel and appear so silky, I can just apply a bit of blusher and I'm ready to go. Since I'm 63, that's saying something!<br /><br />The Amazon product description refers to the primer as a &#34;powdery gel&#34; -- and that's a perfect description. It feels really good on my skin and makes my skin look better regardless of whether I follow it with foundation, just powder or blusher, or nothing else at all.<br /><br />The price of this foundation primer seems a bit high until it becomes apparent how long it lasts. It doesn't take much to cover the face; a little goes a long way. Plus, if you go to the Global Care Essentials website, you'll see that it's substantially higher there than on Amazon!<br /><br />My experience with this product has been thoroughly delightful, and I'm very glad to have found it. I can recommend it highly.", "images": [], "asin": "B017IIV4XI", "parent_asin": "B017IIV4XI", "user_id": "AEIFO5AJLF3XTOJVUOZAFOJJSDDQ", "timestamp": 1466484164000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing product for extremely dry skin", "text": "When you scoop the product out of the container, it is a thick paste that tends to be crumbly. You have to carefully massage it onto your skin, making sure little chunks don't fall on the ground. But it definitely works to soften, protect and heal extremely dry, irritated, and even cracked skin. And a little does go a long way. The container is glass and just small enough to fit in my coat pocket, which makes it convenient to carry around.<br /><br />I have serious eczema, and Gold Clover and Burt's Bees Hand Salve are the only natural products that are thick enough to provide relief. The difference between this and Burt's Bees is that Gold Clover is less greasy and seems to absorb quicker. But Burt's Bees smells better to me. Although this Gold Clover does have a light mint/lavender scent, overall the product smells milky. It doesn't bother me too much and thankfully the smell does go away. However, the smell reminds me baby milk spit up. Also, sometimes the thought of rubbing dead animal fat on my skin gets a little weird. But I use this several times a day, especially after hand washing, and my skin is looking better than ever.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product that provides relief for eczema and healing for extremely dry skin. It's a great alternative to chemically-laden but well-publicized products like O'Kieff's for Working Hands. If you order in bulk, it's more economical to do it through their website.

It just makes you feel pretty and put together. However my manicures only last about a day and then I would get in the shower to get ready for the next day and POOF! The polish would crack and peel away. All that time to paint your nails, two coats of color with 15 minutes in between to dry and a top coat that takes 20 minutes to dry. All that time and it only lasts one day if your lucky. What a waste of time! Well gel colors have changed all that and Sally Hansen has not only made a good one but it's also affordable. Gel coats will last any where between 7 to 14 days. Sally's gel also need no annoying light to activate the gel, however be sure to purchase and apply the Sally top coat or the gel will not activate and it will last less time than regular polish.", "images": [], "asin": "B01IMEH6GG", "parent_asin": "B01IMEH6GG", "user_id": "AH7NQYFM7ZSRAH54RBWX7I4UKXJA", "timestamp": 1478543612000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

The sander works the same as any other battery powered shaver.  The epilator is a life changer though. The first time you use it is a bit rough if you haven't used one before, or get waxed. But I haven't had to pick up a razor since I started using this. Each time is easier, and the hairs grow back soft rather than the nasty stubble you get from shaving. Also, I've noticed less and less hair growing back. I could probably pluck the individual hairs on my legs if I had to.<br />Be warned though that the ingrown hair issue is real.  If you do not exfoliate you will regret it.  As to the battery life issue, when I first started using this I would be able to only do one whole leg before the battery started winding down. I could maybe get through both armpits and forearms on a single charge. But now there's so little hair that I can do everything on one charge (both legs from foot to groin, armpits and forearms).<br />With all this said, the device stopped working today.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Valentia : True Glow Eye Cream Review", "text": "Next on the Valentia beauty line, comes the True Glow Eye Cream for review. I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!<br /><br />Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:<br /><br />Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles<br />Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes<br />Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.<br />Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.<br /><br />Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.", "images": [], "asin": "B014DH4FTC", "parent_asin": "B014DH4FTC", "user_id": "AEKWD5653VPVL7PHTDABCF5V7JCQ", "timestamp": 1456791554000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Oz Naturals: 2.5% Retinol Serum with Astaxanthin and Vitamin E Review", "text": "The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.<br /><br />Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!<br /><br />I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!<br /><br />Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.<br /><br />Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonal allergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Oz Naturals.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "InstaNatural: Cellulite Cream Review", "text": "InstaNatural: Cellulite Cream<br /><br />This product is part of their Body Creams collection and helps with everything from the cellulite to the dimples a person may suffer from. You get a boost from:<br /><br />Caffeine- Derived from green tea, which provides you with instant firming and lifting results<br />Retinol- allows the skin to resurface at a quicker pace, lessening the appearance of the cellulite/dimples<br />Cocoa Butter- softens and also helps keep the skin looking beautiful<br />Shea Butter- allows the \u201cnewer\u201d skin to get a healthy amount of nutrients and moisture<br />Vitamin C- helps your skin hold more moisture and gives it a healthy glow (brightens)<br />Vitamin B5- helps to keep skin soft and healthy, but also provides a smoother look<br />All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested<br /><br />Application- The product works best when applied twice a day, just like a facial skincare regimen. You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.<br /><br />What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I\u2019m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural\u2019s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the \u201cturn-over\u201d process of shedding our \u201cdamaged\u201d looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin\u2019s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.

This makes it difficult to use and therefore it starts to fall down into the drain, along with the value of this specific soap.<br /><br />If this soap lasted another week I would give it 4-5 stars. However, it lasted less than a week for two of us sharing it. At $14-16 a week in soap, there is not enough of a value proposition there for us to continue using it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "A Unique, All-In-One Serum", "text": "I was in the cosmetics and skincare business for 25 years and am very ingredient conscious. The makeup of this serum is truly impressive. It's also unusual to find one with Vitamin C and Retinol together in the same serum. This was my first time using this product and I was trying a new moisturizer as well so I did a controlled study. I washed my face and applied the serum alone. My face turned very red and hot like a bad sunburn. I washed it off, applied straight aloe Vera gel to calm my skin and left it on overnight. By the next morning all was well so I cleansed my skin as usual and applied the new moisturizer (which was also by Elrique Naturals) and the same thing happened. Needless to say both products were extremely uncomfortable to use. Comparing the ingredients I don't see anything listed on either product that would cause this.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great for psoriasis", "text": "I buy everything I review. To receive FIVE stars, a product must meet &#62;90% of the manufacturer's claims. I don\u2019t subtract because I don\u2019 t like the color or appearance (too subjective and personal). I review form, function, ease of use, and construction quality. Please forgive typos: I\u2019m an evidence-based scientist, NOT a typist. If you find my review helpful, please click &#34;YES&#34;. This helps me improve future evaluations (which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions).<br /><br />Their Claim:  Controls the itch of psoriasis<br /><br />My Verdict (details below):  True for most people<br /><br />As a physician, I know how itchy this condition can be on your scalp. I recommend coal tar shampoo to all my patients. Most dandruff shampoos use salicylic acid (which is aspirin) for the itching, which is NOT very good at stopping the itch. My wife has tried that with NO success. Coal tar is much better at controlling it and is the active ingredient in most topical creams for psoriasis of the skin. It's available in higher strengths by prescription, but this product at 2.5% is sufficient for most scalps.<br /><br />Just use it 3x/week for adequate control. Let it sit in the scalp for five minutes, which means apply immediately upon entering the shower, then do your stuff. Just before exiting, wash it out. It's okay to leave some in the scalp; it won't hurt you. You may wish to use shampoo after, but this has shampoo/conditioner in it and in my experience, using other hair products is counterproductive.<br /><br />This tingles, so you know it's working. The only problem? It's nearly impossible to find in stores, and is often sold out at Amazon. Other companies make similar products. Just type COAL TAR SHAMPOO in the search bar to find others. They all have 2.5-3% coal tar. You need a script for 5% for some idiotic reason. What, you're going to get addicted to the stuff and overdose? The FDA is a real killer sometimes.<br /><br />If you itch, here's the product for you if you can find it.

If you're doing debating as well, seriously just buy it. Its less than 10 bucks and definitely worth using on your ears or other pierced areas. I have very sensitive skin so when I went up a size before I got the balm, my ears would be irritated for weeks to a little over a month. They would constantly be hot, itchy, dry and clear discharge would be oozing down my neck. GROSS! I even waited 10 months to go up a size and that was only at the 12G-10G stage.<br /><br />2 days after I got the balm, I prepped my ears after a shower. Rubbed the balm generously over my left ear and on the taper. There was very minimal tugging and it did not make me cringe. Took less than a minute to get the taper in compared to before, taking over 5 minutes of twisting, pushing, & massaging to get the taper in w/out the balm. Took no more than 5 days to &#34;fully heal.&#34; No dry, flaky, irritated, oozing ear. Waited 6 months this time around to size up to 2G.<br /><br />At the same time, my right ear was already infected because I had to replace my plug but I was out in public and only had a spare in my purse. I cleaned it as best as I can but it didnt work. My ear felt like it was back to its newly stretched phase- cracked skin, bump under the ear and clear discharge constantly flowing down. Cleaned my plugs and my ear with salt water then rubbed the balm all over. It started to heal up faster than it did when all I had was salt water & vitamin E oil.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who's trying to stretch their ears.", "images": [], "asin": "B005BZQHEC", "parent_asin": "B005BZQHEC", "user_id": "AF3DEGPJYY75I5NFXSHJXXN2S4HA", "timestamp": 1410891052000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "ASP Lightless Gel is awesome for repairing a broken natural nail, a must have!", "text": "UPDATE 10/13/14 I had originally rated this item a five stars and I've left my original review unedited because it was accurate HOWEVER I've changed the rating to three stars because of the following.<br /><br />I've found that when I use this product to repair a broken, or pealing or split nail, when its freshly applied, it's awesome BUT when a few days go by and the product starts to get old it starts to lift and the problem is that even being very careful, if the product peals from the nail, IT TAKES A FEW LAYERS OF THE NATURAL NAIL WITH IT and that's what I was one of the things I was trying to prevent when I applied this product...What I ended up doing was soaking off the remainder of this product and patching the now really damaged area of my nail with ASP Fiberglass<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=asp%20fiberglass&sprefix=ASP+fi%2Caps%2C272 and two layers of brush on nail glue which is the method I plan to continue using from now on since it does not lift and tear my nails...http://www.amazon.com/Spilo-MISC-Bondini-Plus-Brush-On/dp/B0002Z8SE8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413205777&sr=8-1&keywords=brush+on+nail+glue.<br /><br />Although I bought mine at my local Sally's, this product is so awesome, I had to come an give it a thumbs up!<br /><br />Now let me say that I have natural nails that tend to break at the base (bead) of the nail & so cutting them is not a painfree option nor a pretty one at that ;)<br /><br />The only reason why I use all three products (listed below) is to repair broken nails, to give them time to grow out while I get to have pretty, all the same length nails ;)<br /><br />This \"light less gel\" has a thicker consistency than brush on glue, which by the way, was the method I was using prior to coming across this gem in a YouTube tutorial video.<br /><br />Now it does not come with a brush applicator so I took an empty nail polish bottle, cleaned it out & I filled it with pure acetone to prevent the brush from getting hard; & that's the brush I use to apply this gel.  Just make sure to wipe the brush a few time on a napkin before using to wipe off the acetone.<br /><br />After I've removed the old nail polish, I wipe my nail clean with either an alcohol pad or some acetone. I then cut an appropriate piece of the fiberglass to cover the break.  I apply the fiberglass to the clean nail & I apply a thin line of this gel over the patch, then I take my handy, dandy nail polish brush & I spread out a thin layer of the gel over the entire nail, same as if I was applying nail polish.  Then I spray the Gel Cure (which is a god sent because it dries this thick gel almost instantly) & voila! the nail is as good as not, well you know ;) Now depending on the size of the break, use your judgement to determine if you need a 2nd layer.  This method last more than the regular nail glue & as such, soaking it off will take a little more time but who cares as long as your nail has time to grown without suffering from either pain or an odd looking manicure ;)<br /><br />When you add the cost of the fiberglass, the gel & the cure, you are looking at approximately $30 BUT this will last a long, long, long time so for me its cost effective.<br /><br />If you have natural nails that tend to split, these items are a must.  These are staples in my \"manicure rescue arsenal\".<br /><br />Highly recommended items for sure!<br /><br />I bought this \"light less gel\", the<br /><br />ASP Gel Cure<br />http://www.amazon.com/ASP-Gel-Cure/dp/B00IYPRZOW/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1402513514&sr=1-3&keywords=lightless+gel<br /><br />& the ASP All Season Nail Fiberglass Nail Wrap<br />http://www.amazon.com/All-Season-Nail-Fiberglass-Wrap/dp/B0064TPMIQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1402513563&sr=1-1&keywords=nail+fiberglass<br /><br />UPDATE 7/3/14<br />Just wanted to point out that should you decide to yank off this product with you teeth or if you are a \"picker\", be prepared to lose a layer or two of your natural nail. WHICH MEANS DAMAGING YOUR NAIL UNTIL IT GROWS OUT WHICH DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING AND APPLYING THIS PRODUCT.  This product should be removed with a cotton ball soaked in acetone, wrapped in aluminum foil for about ten to fifteen minutes so as to remove the product safely WITHOUT damaging your nail.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "if you like that flaxmeal/hempseed sort of taste you'll like this oil", "text": "This is a large UV-protected BPA-free plastic bottle. I've been slathering it all over myself to see what effect it had topically. I personally like the smell-it's a soft wheaty-flaxy-earthy smell. It smells like something real which is what it is; nothing else but the real cold-pressed oil. I also like the taste which is similar to the smell. I haven't tried it yet but think it might be able to be used as the oil in salad dressings- if you like the taste. As to the topical effect well first it just sits on your skin but after a minute or two it just disappears into your skin which continues to smell faintly of the smell I mentioned above. I think it does the job of softening skin- a sort of hydrating, softening effect on my hands which already were fine so the effect isn't noticeably apparent. My feet seem to be loving this stuff (put socks on after you put the oil on!) and seem to be smoother and stay that way all day. I actually bought it to eat- and from what I've read one or two teaspoons a day is a good amount for those who aren't sure if they get enough vitamin E in their diet<br /> (salad greens, whole wheat, sunflower seeds etc) I have read that vitamin E is antagonistic to estrogen so if you are on the pill you should see if this has any negative effects when taking the pill- I don't know the answer. In general too much estrogen isn't a good thing so perhaps this characteristic of vitamin E would be helpful to some- especially men who are worried about too much estrogen? Anyway you don't want to take too much of anything in particular and you can take too much vitamin E (fat soluble )but as far as I can tell that amount is more than a 'reasonable person' would think of taking anyway. I have only taken it for two days internally and already notice that my hands and feet seem to be a lot warmer and since it's supposed to be good for circulation that's to be expected. The company that makes it, Naissance, British, sourced from Scotland, has tried to make a topnotch product and I think has achieved it.

I've only tried this product for one day, but holy moley, even just waking up in the morning not soaked is a huge game changer. I'm concerned about overheating on warmer days though, so may have to just use with some caution. But the instructions technically say only use at night, 1 hour after showing, and don't use during the day. So maybe that's why. Also I had at least followed the 1 hour after showering thing and I did not experience any stinging or pain even in the slightest that some others mentioned. Usually after showering and exfoliating your skin it might be more sensitive immediately after, so if folks are using it immediately after maybe that's why it stings? Lastly, I do use a light moisturizer on my face because my cheeks get dry. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the brand, so it is an Ives and you can figure out the rest. But if you have combination skin, it's not heavy and doesn't leave residue.

Super-easy to use...I just combed it into a tween's blonde hair (no bleaching). Gave the colour great dimension with the various shades of natural blonde.

I cannot figure out how you'd blow-dry hair that's IN a shower cap as you do it (part of the instructions), so I just removed the cap and did the blowdry while gently combing through the hair with a comb (until dry). Then a rinse - this is where all the blue looks like it's coming out. Use cooler water.<br /><br />We re-dyed every 7 days, and the colour stayed vibrant.<br /><br />Since then, it's been about two months and the electric blue went to pale cotton-candy blue, then to teal, now it's the colour that blonde hair goes with too much pool chlorine in the summer (sort of a washed-out green). I've heard that you can get more colour out by using a &#34;clarifying&#34; shampoo, but the tween seems happy with the transformation.<br /><br />No real mess, but the bath does have a faint blue tinge to the bottom from the rinsing.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Better than Sonicare or Interplak", "text": "This is the fourth electric toothbrush I've owned in 7-8 years, and is by far my favorite.<br /><br />I did love my Interplak brushes, which came recommended by my dentist as having the best cleaning action, but they were not durable (hence \"brushes\" and not \"brush\"). They say the key to getting an Interplak to last is to not use toothpaste, just dip the brush head into some Listerine. Sorry, but for me that wasn't a satisfying brushing experience.<br /><br />After two Interplaks died, I moved on to Sonicare. That brush is more durable. My husband is still using it. But when I went to the dentist and told the hygienist who cleaned my teeth that I used a Sonicare, she said that must be the reason my gums were bleeding. In fact, she said pretty much every patient she sees that has bleeding gums is using a Sonicare. I don't think she means that no one can clean their teeth successfully with that brand of brush, but apparently it fails a lot of people.<br /><br />I did find the Sonicare to be a very tough toothbrush to use because of what I'll call \"the splatter factor.\" I couldn't brush some areas of my mouth very thoroughly without spraying toothpaste everywhere. I can't count the number of times I had to change my shirt after brushing in the morning. Because it was difficult to maneuver, I probably didn't brush my gums the way I should have.<br /><br />So, my dentist recommended a Braun / Oral B brush. Initially, they recommended a brush that cost more than $100. It had all kinds of bells and whistles, including a digital display that you could affix to your mirror which would tell you how well you were brushing. I decided to first try the Braun technology with this super-affordable model, partly because of my experience changing brushes over the years, and partly because the Oral B web site claimed the exact same plaque removing power (I think 97 percent) for every single brush they offer, regardless of price.<br /><br />This model has absolutely NO bells or whistles. It doesn't even have the standard LED light on the handle to show you when it's recharging. It just has one button that turns it on and off. That's all I need.<br /><br />A couple of key differences between the Sonicare and the Oral B brushes:<br /><br />1) With this Oral B brush, I can use REAL toothpaste.<br /><br />2) The entire brush head rotates, not the individual brushes. For me, this is more comfortable. It also takes the splatter factor down to about zero.<br /><br />3) Both brushes have a 2-minute timer, but whereas the Sonicare shuts off after two minutes, this Oral B brush gives a pulsing signal at two minutes and then keeps going. For me personally, this is preferred, because I rarely finish brushing in the two minutes allotted. When I'm done, I hit the power button.<br /><br />4) The standard brush head is smaller than some. That is by design -- you brush one tooth at a time rather than sweeping the brush across your teeth -- but some might prefer something with more coverage.<br /><br />It's been several months. My gums are healthier and the battery is going strong. I just bought an additional Vitality brush for my preschool-age son, who's finding it very manageable.<br /><br />My one real complaint is the same one I have had about every electric toothbrush I've owned, which is that you have to remove the brush head  and rinse off the brush mechanism after each use. If you don't, you get a raunchy build-up in that area. I guess there must be something that requires the brushes to be engineered this way, since it's the way all the manufacturers make them. Just be aware of this as you care for your brush.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: You aren't going to beat the value of this brush. It's outstanding technology at a terrific price (and the Amazon price is $3-5 less than what you'll find at retailers).", "images": [], "asin": "B000GBICYE", "parent_asin": "B000GBICYE", "user_id": "AFNY5FSWFJHLFV3Z2W2GVAGH6UDA", "timestamp": 1229378433000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "After 4 months No Longer Works", "text": "At first I thought this was going to be the solution to the problem of the original rechargeable Sonicare toothbrush with batteries that can't be replaced (my original Sonicare stopped holding a charge).<br /><br />However, after only four months (just long enough to waste money replacing the brush head!), the button began to only work erratically, and now it does not work at all (can't power the toothbrush on).<br /><br />The reviews that state that the battery compartment does not keep water out are completely true.  The battery compartment is always moist, and the batteries will begin to rust.<br /><br />I was pleased that my Eneloop batteries worked well to power the toothbrush, so I could be using rechargeable batteries, however it doesn't matter if the toothbrush itself doesn't last past 6 months.<br /><br />The batteries that came with the toothbrush lasted around a month.  The Eneloops needed charged only once in the next three months.<br /><br />Looks like the Sonicare brand just fails on too many levels, regardless of whether you are using the ultra-expensive rechargeable unit, or this unit with two AA batteries.<br /><br />[Update] Flashlights have had \"screw on\" caps for nearly one hundred hears.  The Sonicare toothbrush is the same form factor.  I have no idea why someone at Philips thought a \"clip on\" cap (vs. a screw on) would be better, ESPECIALLY for something you use with water.  I am still COMPLETELY BAFFLED by why they would use this design.  The battery compartment will ALWAYS be moist.  Being able to use rechargeable batteries is clearly superior to being stuck with the Philips Soincare charging station.  However, the fact that your batteries get wet means you will eventually ruin your batteries.  That said, I am about to purchase another one.  Being able to use your own batteries makes it a when, both for the fact that you can replace the batteries and also so that the (much more expensive) toothbrush isn't useless when the internal batteries fail after a year or so.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great for fine limp hair", "text": "I am one of those few people that is cursed with very fine hair that becomes oily/greasy if I do not wash it daily. I tend to avoid hair products that contain the word oil in the product description as I do not need any help in it becoming oily. I also do not use conditioner regularly due to the nature of my hair.<br />My first thoughts upon opening my package of the InstaNatural Argan Oil Shampoo, was that it was well protected by the quality seals. There is a thin plastic cover over the bottle to prevent leakage during shipment, and another quality seal that you have to remove by taking off the top of the bottle. The first thing I do when I go to buy or use a new shampoo is to smell it. When ordering hair products online, you do not get to smell before you buy and have to depend on the seller or reviews for a description of the scent. The scent of this shampoo is a clean scent. It is mild and not overwhelming. It is not a perfume smell or a fruity smell. The best way I can describe it is a nice clean mild smell.<br />I started with hair that had been washed the day before, so it was oily and ready for another wash. I wet my hair and applied about a quarter size amount to my hair. I have shoulder length hair, so I do not need much. This shampoo has an amazing lather to it. It is thick and you can really feel it working through your hair. I scrubbed it in from the scalp to the ends. Then I rinsed. I am one of those that needs to feel/hear the squeak when I am rinsing to know my hair is really clean. And this shampoo passed that test very well. I did not use any conditioner afterwards, because I do not normally, unless it is a weekly treatment.<br />I usually air dry my hair, and I did this time as well. My hair came out so soft and full of body and did not have any heavy feeling to it. I woke up this morning without the greasy/oily feel I usually get the next day after I wash. I was very surprised by this, because like I said that is normally what my hair feels like unless I wash it daily. It is still soft and feels silky to the touch.<br />I had my fiance do the sniff test to see what he thought of the smell, and he said it smelled nice.<br />If you are like me and have been avoiding any shampoos because of the description having oil in it, I would say to give this one a try. It is like a clarifying shampoo with just the right amount to give your hair the softness that it needs without weighing it down.<br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410Bj3C1TzL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410Bj3C1TzL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410Bj3C1TzL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01AC82KQQ", "parent_asin": "B01AC82KQQ", "user_id": "AFMGVJ32NRSIEQNVYAZSV7G2SAGA", "timestamp": 1455549134000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just get it!", "text": "I just bought this from Sally's today and use it a little bit ago. I waited until my hair was completely dry before I left a review. This stuff is absolutely amazing! I know Amazon's not going to count this as a verified review since I did not buy it from here which is why I left the picture. I'll give a bit of a backstory of my hair. I ended up falling on the Ombre train and figured I could do it at home. Big mistake! My hair was completely and utterly fried. It has been 9 months and I have used every single thing under the sun to try and keep my hair soft. I have bought masks off of Amazon, Walmart, Sally's Beauty, eBay, Dillons, and any other store that I can find. All of them worked fairly well while my hair is still damp, but after it dries it becomes a bit crunchy again. I really wish I would have taken a before picture of my ends. I could literally hold them and they would stand up straight. This stuff eliminate everything. I have done that extra protein, soy, coconut oil, argan oil, everything you could think of and nothing helped. My hair feels completely healthy and so , so soft again. I'm naturally curly so I have to deal with frizz. After using this, my hair has a natural shine to it (not the oily kind that many hair masks do) My fruzz is under control and my curls are actually separated. I already have an order of this on the way. I know there's only two reviews on this and if I had seen it I would have bypassed it. If you have dry, crunchy, stringy, or unhealthy hair I cannot recommend this enough! I am so thankful that the lady at Sally's recommend this to me", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rGrI5umEL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rGrI5umEL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rGrI5umEL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07K7VD98J", "parent_asin": "B0BV1FPZY6", "user_id": "AE64XWB3PDRQVWSHGT7JLUBF2LEA", "timestamp": 1544909771318, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "the best straightener I've ever had", "text": "[[VIDEOID:845447c6beecddb11ab6abfb0ae8364d]] Seriously, this is the best straightening tool I've ever owned! My hair has never gotten so straight so quickly without being burned. In the video you can see how quick it goes from damp with a thermal protector in my hair to straight from scalp to end with just a few quick strokes. That probably took me an eighth of the time it normally takes me and that is no joke!<br />I've used hot combs: the ones that you plug in and the old school ones that go straight off the stove on to your hair with embers sparking my hair and everything. I've used ceramic and different metal plated flat irons. I've spent hundreds of dollars on irons and I spent $30 on irons, and this has got to be the most awesome invention for hair straightening yet! I even was desperate enough one time that I used a clothes iron on my hair to get done quicker. It shaved a couple of hours off but wasn't worth the damage and the scalp that I couldn't get that close too.<br />I like how you can see what the temperature is and you can put it on the temperature that you would prefer. It's really easy to read and lots of really bright. The buttons are easy to push and are clearly labeled. Don't be alarmed when you first look at the bristles. It doesn't look like it would come very well because it looks so rubbery, but it really does a great job. As you can see in the video, I still brushed before I used the straightening brush, only because I wanted to have is a little heat on my hair as possible and I didn't want to be worrying about tangles. That's another thing, when I straighten my hair, I go back and forth constantly with a brush or comb and the flat iron to make sure I'm not heating the hair in a awkward position. This took the need of that intermediate comb or brush between the heat process. It made it so much quicker and I am so happy to have this brush!<br />You can see in the pictures of my daughters hair and in the video how close I'm able to get to the scalp. It works so well and it's really convenient. The only thing that I would change is how hot the back of the brush gets. It's hard to figure out how to play put it down without having a holder available. I put it on a towel on the bed, and it got pretty hot. So if there was a way for them to put a different material it on the back, it would be absolutely perfect!

After it dries, it is still soft unlike a regular washcloth that gets hard and stiff. It does get makeup marks on it, especially from my mascara, but they come out in the wash.  I was curious as to whether the towel actually took off all of my makeup when compared to a prepackaged wipe so I used a wipe after I used this makeup remover. There was very little makeup on the wipe. I was very pleasantly surprised. I also like that the makeup remover is rectangular instead of the small square shape that some of the similar products are.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Easy to put into the hair, comes with everything you need except pliers.", "text": "I purchased these at a discount to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. These come as one big grouping rubber banded at the top together. I marked this down a star for two reasons, one I wish the color groupings were banded separately because trying to pick through and find just the one (or ones you want) only made us tangle the hair more and we had to stop and comb it to untangle it. Having them packaged separately instead as one big grouping would have saved us this trouble. The other reason is because the colored crimp rings that come with them has a clear plastic or rubber ring inside them that must be removed for the extension to fit through. The instructions said nothing about this and I was getting frustrated on the first one I did thinking it wasn't going to fit until I knocked that clear inside ring out of the way and then it worked fine. Neither of these are deal breakers for potentially buying these for my teen in the future again, but they would be nice improvements!<br /><br />This came with three colors of crimp beads which is nice for different colors of hair to help blend it into the roots. Everything you need is included except a pair of pliers which most households have in their basic or crafting tool kits. I put one in my teenaged daughters hair to show her how to do it, and after that she found it easy enough to do in both her and other peoples hair. They go in and seem pretty durable since they are synthetic. The color will last longer than a real dye job will. The colors are bright and fun.

So I was a bit skeptical about this cuticle pusher because all I have ever used are the bamboo stick ones which dull very quickly and it seems I'm always purchasing, the cost was adding up so I haven't bought them in awhile and try to make do with what I have. This did seem like a bit much to pay for, but when you think about what you are saving in costs of disposables and how many years this one will last you it is not as bad as I had thought. Now prices always change on here so it may be a different amount when you look into purchasing it so just do the same thing, weigh the cost of buying disposables with how much it is currently selling for.<br /><br />Now when it arrived it came in a plastic slip cover that you can keep it clean while being stored. It's simple and cheap, but I didn't mark it down because it's considered packaging. Something a little more durable would have been good. I'm not sure how long it will last before it starts to tear at the seams from taking the pusher in and out.<br /><br />The pusher itself is all metal which is really nice as it means you can toss it in the dishwasher or a pot of boiling water to sanitize it often which is a good idea since it's not disposable and your hands, especially your nails carry a ton of germs! The end is flat enough and slightly rounded or smoothed off at the end so that it does not feel sharp against your skin at all. I was worried since I'm used to softer wood that the metal would be painful to use but it really hasn't been each time I've used it. It will work on the cuticles themselves, but I highly recommend soaking your hands in a bit of warm/hot (what you can tolerate or enjoy) slightly soapy water with a few drops of essential oil (again of your liking) in it for some moisturizing and cleaning. This will help to soften them up and make them easier to slide back. Once your done put a bit of oil or other cuticle moisturizer or cream on to keep them feeling good! Whenever you use lotion make sure to rub a bit into the cuticles to keep them feeling soft and good, or if you really have the time use the specialized cuticle creams or lotions every day on them!<br /><br />Once I'm done if I had washed my hands really well and soaked them I might not sanitize this each time like you really should, but I will every few uses or if I picked it up and just started pushes at my dry cuticles without thinking about it or washing my hands!", "images": [], "asin": "B01CURASWA", "parent_asin": "B01CURASWA", "user_id": "AHN7RHYL4Q44AVXEIW5GHACX2IBA", "timestamp": 1459786988000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

He has shorter hair that is slightly curly, he likes that this brush has short hard plastic bristles that manages his hair without causing static. It also brushes his hair easily into the directions he wants it to go when he is styling it. He doesn't have long hair that tangles so he can't say how it works there, but he really likes how it works on his short hair.<br /><br />Since he couldn't answer that I tried it and had my 6th grade son try it in his hair that is longer. The sides are buzzed, but the top section is several inches long and can fit into pony tails.

I\u2019ve been using this and an older model I bought years ago and this one wins hands down. I don\u2019t really have acne. My issues are t-zone congestion and my skin\u2019s texture isn\u2019t smooth. I\u2019m in my mid 30s so I\u2019m trying to get on the anti-aging boat lol. I really like that this has a heat feature. However, It takes about 1 minute 30<br />seconds to heat up so I\u2019ll let it run and do something else. Wen it shuts off then I turn it on again and actually use it. Also the heat is mild. The device makes my skin super smooth and is gentle on the skin. I have combo/normal skin and I can\u2019t stop touching my face. I wake up the next morning and my skin is still smooth. I started using it once a day, then twice a day but switched to once every three days on the lowest setting. My skin is still smooth so I don\u2019t want to overdo it. You will see redness but it goes away fairly quickly. I wet my face, I wet the device and add my cleanser directly it. You can use less cleanser because the device distributes it nicely. This seems to work best with a cream cleanser. It stays on for 2 minutes but 1 minute should suffice. It doesn\u2019t have a beep to let you know when to switch sections. The last setting that dries the device is a nice touch. I only get water on the bristles so I can\u2019t speak on it being waterproof.  I\u2019m thinking of purchasing another one for when the current one needs replacing. This device either has a 1 year warranty which is wonderful.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mixed review - read for thoughts/cautions", "text": "Very hard to write a fair review on this product.  (1) yes, it will activate the peeling of a layer or two, and usually with in a couple of days, (2) product design is a bit cumbersome to use (a plastic bag bootie that has the ooze inside that is a bit of a struggle to get on your foot, and (3) because the goo inside is all over the plastic bootie, it not only gets on the bottom of your feet, but all over your entire foot (bottom, top, ankle, etc.).  As a result of #3, not only did my entire foot feel tight and tingly for days, but the product created a very irritable rash on the tops of my feet. The rash has been there all week and still hasn't subsided.  This would be a much better product if you could just put it on the bottoms of your feet or where the dry/calloused skin is.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing shampoo and conditioner! I highly suggest for curly haired people.", "text": "I was totally blown away by this shampoo and conditioner, especially considering I had never heard of this brand before. Let me assure you, this stuff is AH-mazing! And not only that, it's curly girl approved! Allow me to give you some background on my hair type before I review the shampoo and conditioner individually. I have very long, very thick, highly porous, somewhat dry, very frizzy, naturally curly hair. My curly hair type is about a 3A/3B. Now about the shampoo. The shampoo is completely sulfate and silicone free (I don't use sulfates or silicones in my hair), and while washing my hair the very first time, it actually felt like it was moisturizing my hair while actually getting it clean, and not stripping my hair at all. Like, that's quite a trifecta! I've found that a lot of sulfate free shampoos don't leave your hair feeling quite clean, but this one really does. That shampoo doesn't smell like much, it smells fresh, but doesn't have a powerful odor at all. The conditioner, however, is amazing! I wasn't expecting much from it because it has so few ingredients, which are mostly oils, but holy cow, this stuff felt amazing on my hair! A lot of silicone free conditioners don't have much slip, so it makes detangling your hair in the shower a bit difficult, but this was super easy, my fingers glided right through my hair, my hair felt silky, and best of all, it didn't take a ton of product to achieve this effect like it does with a lot of conditioners. The conditioner definitely has more of an herbal scent to it, but it's a pleasant one that I enjoy, and I don't think it's objectionable to anyone. All this being said, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this shampoo and conditioner set, I think I'm a convert for life!<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

First off they have some of the best smelling beard grease(balm) ive tried and I\u2019ve tried a good dozen brands. Their spice scent is legit heaven. Probably my favorite but all their scents are amazing. I\u2019d have to rank spice as my #1 though it smells like a good fall season scent which I love #2 is a tie between the other 3 scents(black tie, whiskey tobacco, and wilderness)  becuase they\u2019re just so good and I like them all equally and that\u2019s rare, usually I\u2019ll only like 1 or 2 scents from a company. I\u2019m picky. The feel to the beard grease is also high quality it\u2019s a thick creamy consistency that melts in your hands fast and isn\u2019t real greasy which is ironic since the name would imply that it would be greasy. It seems to make my beard look more dense and thick as well. The hold is great it lays my beard better than all the others and that\u2019s just the original compound so I bet rugged hold version is even better on taming which I\u2019m gonna try and write a review on. Also the package arrived way faster than I expected it to which is a plus. I took the time to review them because I genuinely love their products and they have great customer service. I have nothing negative to say or any constructive criticism because everything is done right by this company. 5 star on everything for them. Also if you buy from their website you get free shipping if you spend $15.

I didn\u2019t read the description very closely, because they are shorter than I expected, but that\u2019s my fault\u2026.the listing clearly says they are 39 inches, which they are. Actually that worked out better for the worship team than long ones since they are all standing on stage, close to each other.<br />The colors are not what I was expecting, they are much better. They come in random colors and we got gold, red, blue, green and hot pink. They are much brighter and more vibrant than the pictures would lead you to believe.<br />I really like that the handle has some weight to it. It didn\u2019t come into play for our purposes, but if you\u2019re doing gymnastics, having the weight in the handle makes tosses much more predictable. The handle will always fall first and vertically so it is easy to catch.<br />All in all, a great product!<br /><br />I received these gymnastic rhythmic ribbons at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615bmYEB3CL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615bmYEB3CL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615bmYEB3CL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HNLiPv3FL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HNLiPv3FL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HNLiPv3FL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vbqhjlU3L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vbqhjlU3L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vbqhjlU3L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01EW5W6EG", "parent_asin": "B01EW5W6EG", "user_id": "AF37F7C2BFWEBULS2TSWOPQHH5QA", "timestamp": 1469629347000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

Probably just this one installation.  It's getting frizzier by the day.  You can still finger throught it - it's not tangled, it just looks very frizzy and dry. Certain areas are worse than others. It did have a strong odor when it arrived, and I washed it several times and haven't noticed any odor since the installation.  All in all - I wouldn't buy it again because I really don't like how tightly curled/frizzy it is - some may like this look. It does look exactly like the picture whenyou take it out the pack and first install it.  But, after the first night of sleep and a day's worth of styling, the curls are def not that uniform.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Bad seal", "text": "I got this grapefruit scrub a few days ago. I will have to say the size is smaller than I expected. I did not pay attention on the size when I made the order. But it is smaller than when most scrubs I used to see in the store. The packaging is ok. The seller tried to protect the item in the box. However, the bottle I got is either opened before or not sealed well. The oil inside is leaking. I have to clean the bottle before I put it on my table. I am disappointed on this situation. Not enough oil is left inside to keep the sea salt moist. And when I opened the scrub, the smell of grapefruit is not strong and is not natural. It is not smells like natural fruit. It is ok for me since the smell will not stay anyway after I clean my skin after apply it. The good part I like of this scrub is that after apply it, I do feel my skin is more smooth. Right now, the sea salt in my bottle is kind of dry because of the oil leak. Maybe it will be better if you luckily get a good one. However, you need to pay attention that this product is not that gentle to the skin. I do not recommend using this product on our very soft and sensitive area. It will be good for hands, knees, feet and maybe legs. BUT NOT FACE even though it says for body and face. I will not use it on my face. When applying it on the skin, please do it very gentle so it does not hurt. Overall, this is an average performed body scrub. But for this price, I feel it is a bit over priced compared to what I can buy from TjMaxx.<br />I purchased this product at a free/discounted price in return for an honest testing and evaluation review.

I wasn't sure if it was because the on/off was marked on the lid but not the tube, maybe I just turned it the wrong amount? \u00bd turn seemed reasonable, so I turned it tighter and more came out the sides. For what it's worth, the instructions just have us dabbing a couple dots on with the sponge and blending with the fingers or brush. The sponge is an entirely unnecessary addition.<br /><br />As you can see from the photo, this did allow me to put a nice and thick layer on my arm just in case anyone is looking to see how dramatic it can be. I do like the color, it's a good match, but I wouldn't use it on my eyes or my lips because the product says 'liquid blush.' There is a graphic on this page that says 2-in-1, despite showing eyes/blush/lips on the very same graphic, which I am pretty sure would be 3-in-1.<br /><br />The last issue is the ingredients. The top ingredient is Ethylhexyl Palmitate, which is a pretty well known comedogenic (pore clogging) problem, so it's not great if you have breakouts. That's why I don't know how long it lasts or well it holds up over time, it's not worth the high risk of breakouts so I didn't wear it long. You might have guessed that 'palmitate' is also a derivative of Palm Oil, which is an industry that is destroying many biodiverse forests.<br /><br />Two stars for color, texture feels nice, but I would only recommend this to people with clear skin that don't really have any desire to use the applicator sponge.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518vv4LeB-L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518vv4LeB-L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518vv4LeB-L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Qz4cY8BWL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Qz4cY8BWL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Qz4cY8BWL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612dqlLGy7L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612dqlLGy7L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612dqlLGy7L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QgbunhHFL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QgbunhHFL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QgbunhHFL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j2jp54zpL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j2jp54zpL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j2jp54zpL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0BNGZK9ZH", "parent_asin": "B0BX53H8XD", "user_id": "AFQOTCWHOUNSIKPQ4P74PPGXOMEA", "timestamp": 1676614315588, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I instead use a fine tooth slid-up trimmer on another shaver for that.

After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* It gives a great shave! They've changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.<br /><br />* It's quiet. I can actually have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn't possible with my older shaver.<br /><br />* It is significanly lighter than my older model.<br /><br />* Cleanup is really easy. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you're supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.<br /><br />* It's hard to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you'll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This isn't nearly as handy.<br /><br />* The shape isn't as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it's wet. It doesn't feel very good in your hand.<br /><br />* There is no case to store it in. This is a drawback if you use it to travel.<br /><br />* The head is supposed to be replaced once a year. Huh??? This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers. These heads aren't cheap, folks. I certainly wouldn't replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I'd probably buy a new one.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'm very pleased with this shaver.

I highly suggest that users find their own positive control - find something you know has nickel, and test that to see the pink and know you're doing it right.<br /><br />Also, this seems to release ammonia gas when the solutions are mixed, so use in a well-ventilated area, and don't put your face right over the swab or item being tested or you'll get a whiff of ammonia in your nose/eyes.<br /><br />As it turns out, real surgical grade stainless steel does test NEGATIVE for nickel!

They really do remove makeup with just water.", "text": "I will admit I was extremely skeptical of the claim that these cloths could remove makeup with just water but they do! I would even go as far to say that they do a better job than a cotton cloth with soap on it. I have sensitive skin so using harsh soaps or cleansers is not an option for me. Typically I would struggle to get my mascara completely removed. I would always end up with raccoon eyes requiring me to scrub harder than I would like on the delicate skin below my eyes and I don\u2019t even use waterproof mascara. That problem is a thing of the past now that I have these washcloths. I am able to remove all my makeup with minimal effort and no scrubbing.<br /><br />The cloths are very soft and feel good against your skin whether they are wet or dry. I used one the other day as a sweat rag while I was working out because they are so absorbent; it worked great. The stitching looks solid and they have a nice thick feel to them. I haven\u2019t been using them long enough to run them through the wash but they feel very well made so I am not worried about them falling apart in the wash. I thought they would collect so much makeup that I would need to wash them after almost every use but that is not the case a quick rinse in clean water and they are good to go.<br /><br />The color is true to the picture displayed although I would call it closer to sea foam green than blue.<br /><br />My only complaint is I could do without the rather large tag that stretches across the corner. I will probably look at the stitching a little closer to see if I can safely remove it without ruining them.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

It helped but manicures still started chipping at the 10 day mark and as soon as my nails got to the desired length they would start breaking.<br />By comparison this stuff is amazing! Its all the strength without the bulk of regular acrylic. They are my real nails but nothing will break them.The process itself is faster since you don't have to cure for two minutes each time. The coats between and after powder are just thin glue. Its also more forgiving as the coats are all even and solidly applied. You buff and clean up in the middle of the process which makes everything even and your edges perfect. I've also filed and such after they are done without issue.<br />I actually ordered from Revel itself, but read the reviews here first. Revel colors are also cheaper then gel's options, with a one ounce jar of color only costing about $8. One ounce jar is probably like 8-10 manicures. Sure beats paying a salon $40 every two weeks.<br />Removal is slightly different. I use the cotton ball with nail caps method and find it slightly more time consuming then gel, but I think that's only because I'm still getting used to it. When exposed to acetone the dip turns into a chewed gum consistency. So unlike my CND shellac that peals off I'm rubbing off sticky blobs. But I also probably just need to try soaking it an extra 5 minutes and stop being impatient.<br />But the extra removal time is totally worth it when you consider the manicures last longer, are stronger, and allow me to finally have my dream long nails.", "images": [], "asin": "B01C7532DM", "parent_asin": "B01C7532DM", "user_id": "AHJOWKLJYQT4VSNUO5HLEKRVOHZA", "timestamp": 1531407336702, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

The bristles were made from boars\u2019 hair and the handle from bamboo. Nylon bristles came about around 1938. Today, some toothbrushes still use boar\u2019s bristles, however, some say there are concerns about the action of the natural bristles on the enamel and gums, so many still recommend soft nylon bristles. Here, we have a natural bamboo handle, which is sturdy and durable, with little to no bend and very smooth, so someone took time to sand this down. The bristles are very soft. Which is easy on the gums and enamel. The toothbrush head and handle are perfect for a little one\u2019s mouth, allowing access to those small to reach places. Practicing good oral hygiene is so important, at a young age. Our little one found this toothbrush perfect in size to maneuver about and the bristles comfortable. We see no shedding of a single bristle at this early stage; and plan to rotate this out of commission, after its effectiveness appears of concern, after a bad cold, or just after so many months of service. With that in mind, cost is always a concern. These are no bargain basement toothbrushes. They are a premium product in our opinion and are priced accordingly.  Bamboo toothbrush handles can be composted, used as kindling, and can be repurposed for other household uses. However, just like plastic toothbrush handles, they will take up space in a landfill if just thrown away. We reconsidered using plastic toothbrushes, and now choose bamboo toothbrushes as an alternative to the plastic, which ends up in landfills. Plastic is not designed to break down and plastic toothbrushes are difficult to recycle. We decided bamboo to be an excellent alternative to reduce plastic waste at home. Finally, our little one gave this bamboo toothbrush, with its cute design laser burned into the handle two (2) thumbs up for fit, having that fun handle design, unique style, soft bristle comfort, lack of odor, and ease of using. We agree.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QyTe8m9BL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QyTe8m9BL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QyTe8m9BL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h3e3tYhwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h3e3tYhwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h3e3tYhwL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi350FlJL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi350FlJL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi350FlJL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HPUpSVXGL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HPUpSVXGL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HPUpSVXGL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a2nbep8iL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a2nbep8iL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a2nbep8iL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cFXpn0DIL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cFXpn0DIL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cFXpn0DIL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jK4mRE5CL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jK4mRE5CL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jK4mRE5CL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sGkjwxaxL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sGkjwxaxL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sGkjwxaxL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B093CPFRHJ", "parent_asin": "B093CPFRHJ", "user_id": "AEDVEEUD4NZX7NYETDDN5N3HBJEA", "timestamp": 1659780594402, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

They would easily go through an entire tube in one bath if I wasn't the one to set the limit. To make the small squirts go even further, I give them watercolor paintbrushes to use with the paints. Using the paintbrushes seems to extend the playtime a good bit.<br /><br />Overall, we really enjoy this product. It's a bit pricey, but we can make the four tubes last a few months even when they use the paint a few times a week.", "images": [], "asin": "B017QDHK9M", "parent_asin": "B017QDHK9M", "user_id": "AHKJBA5ZBDO6NOMKY6MHBYQTBZGA", "timestamp": 1501384218462, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I was so excited that it has the straightener built in so I don't have to plug in multiple devices on those days my cowlick is outta control!<br /><br />When it arrived the piece holding the cord was broken. But that didn't really harm anything so I just took it completely off and used it anyway. I'm lazy so I rarely use the straightener although it is nice when I am having a particularly frizzy day. I love the size of the wand it gives just the right amount of curl to keep my bangs from laying flat against my head.<br />I rated it two stars because even with little use the clip that holds the flattening part together so I can use the want has broken. I should have guessed it was cheaply made when the other clip thing came off. I wasn't even opening or closing it when it broke - just using the wand when suddenly it popped open and refused to shut again. This means the inside flatterer doesn't heat properly unless you hold it shut while it heats up.

Leather feels fairly soft for the price, not a super shiny finish which is what I wanted. The quality seems decent. I have one concern and one problem. Concern is that the straps will deteriorate over time with all the sliding through the metal D rings that they do. Can't confirm that'll happen but given my one or two days of use that's a concern I have. The problem I have is that the shape of the bag itself is tapered at the top. So the measurement of the bag's width is not consistent through the whole height of the and thus the opening of the bag. This makes my iPad (in a case) very tricky to get in and out. Also a problem with the top of this bag is it's zippered closure, which is a bit flimsy; I just chose not to use it at all. These two issues were deal breakers for me; I'll have to return. If I was just using it as a purse I'd be able to keep it but I'd like to fit my iPad, possibly a couple of diapers, kid stuff, etc. it's just too small and restricting for that type of use.", "images": [], "asin": "B016EE9AKQ", "parent_asin": "B016EE9AKQ", "user_id": "AFMFMXUIBJHO7NBN6XISUHJV3UYA", "timestamp": 1475320968000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

I am very happy that I did.  I have recently gone back to work in an office after several years of working from home.  This means I actually have to do my hair more often.  After several mornings of burning my fingers, I ditched it for a new one.  And I can't get used to the gloves that you can buy to help prevent that (and never got any with that curling iron).<br />I am so happy with this purchase for a few reasons so far...I have not burned my fingers!!  That's a pretty big reason for me!!  I did receive gloves with this and I am thinking of trying them, they seem to be a better material that the ones I had before, so maybe I will get used to them.  But so far, the tip hasn't gotten so hot that it burns me.  Secondly, I like the temperature adjustment on this because you actually 'click' it with a button, the Baby Bliss has a dial which can easily get bumped during styling (making it too hot!)  So my temp stays exactly where I want it unless I change it.  And finally, the other main selling point for me was that it uses infrared light!!!  Infrared light is a penetrating light and is actually less damaging.  It isn't just heating the outside of the hair strands, and trust me it helps hold my curls longer.  I am a brunette with med thick hair, but finer strands.  Basically, my hair feels thick, but it's finer hair.  And although I have natural wavy/curly hair, for some bizarre reason, it won't hold a curl from a curling iron all day.  Strange, but true.  Overall, it seems to be a very well constructed curling iron and I am happy I am saving the health of my finger tips and my hair from damage.

You just suck the castor oil up into the tube, then release the oil into the mascara tube. I chose to do this process over the kitchen sink, just in case, and it didn't take long at all, even though I was being overly cautious, not to make a mess. When the entire process was completed, I ended up with only a small amount that got on my hands. Not a big deal, at all. I have one small complaint. When you're finished using the suction tube, there's no real way to clean the tube. I chose to wrap the tube with saran/cling wrap. You could use a Ziploc bag, I'm sure, but yeah, it'd be nice if they included a sealable bag for the tube, for storage in-between use. I chose this brand for two reasons, one, the plastic mascara tube that was included, and two, honestly, I just liked the look of the amber glass bottle. I immediately curled my eyelashes, and then applied this oil to test it out. As I'm writing this, the oil is not bothering my eyes. In the future, I plan to apply it at night, before bed.

Another goodie.<br />  Back to the product, it's a thicker consistency than I was expecting. Which turned out to be a good thing. The scrub didn't disapate as quickly as other scrubs I've tried in the past. Which meant even more lather time to really scrub away the troubles of working in freaking customer service all day.<br />  The only con I have is that they could have had more in the packaging. Just like your favorite bag of chips, contained air at the top.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "NO ODOR. (did not work for me)", "text": "Immediately after opening, I tested the product on my hand (see photo) to see if I would have any type of allergic reaction, stinging, or irritation. After a few minutes, I did not notice any of those.<br /><br />PROS/<br />- NO ODOR! I've tried samples of similar products like this in the past and almost all that I have tried/smelled, all have some type of odor or scent. This product does not which is great!<br />- Packaging is really nice. It comes in a cute box- so if you're gifting, this would be extremely easy to wrap or put in a gift bag.<br />- Definitely giftable! Can totally see this being a great little gift to add to any gift bag or gift box. Would even make a great stocking stuffer this coming holiday season.<br />- Consistency of the liquid is nice- it is not thick, not slimy, not super thin, and not heavy.<br />- Easy to use. The brush is similar to most liquid eyeliner brushes so it is easy to apply on your brows and/or lash line.<br /><br />I have using this for a couple of days now. I have been consistent with it and plan to continue... I haven't quite used it long enough to see \"growth\" or any difference quite yet but I will totally update this when or if I do. Though, my brows and lashes have not fallen out so I guess that is a good thing, huh? I'm sold on the no odor!<br /><br />~UPDATE - 01/14/2020<br />It has now been 2+ months of continuous recommend use and I have NOT seen a difference in eyelash length/growth nor in eyebrows. I guess it is possible that everyone will get different results, but I did not get any.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Wouldn\u2019t recommend.", "text": "I unfortunately DO NOT like this product. I had high hopes for this but it is just not working for me.<br /><br />I first tried this product on the back of my hand (picture shown)... did different strokes with the pen- lighter stroke and heavier stroke, short and long. IMMEDIATELY, I noticed that the ink bleeds to where you can barely see the lines... ends up looking like a smudged streak.<br /><br />I waited 30 minutes to let the ink set, and quickly ran the back of my hand under cold water. WITHOUT even having to rub the ink (picture shown), the ink quickly faded and was nearly gone. Not sure how \u201cwaterproof\u201d this product is.<br /><br />I\u2019ve tried this product on my eyebrows numerous times now, and I just cannot get the ink to not bleed. Also, after applying, it\u2019s very hard to see the lines, still ends up looking smeared. I\u2019ve tried gently gliding the pen and even that does not work.<br /><br />Note/<br />- Pen is easy to hold<br />- Consistency comparison... The ink is \u201clighter\u201d and thinner than liquid eyeliner<br /><br />This would work for someone who does not want the lines to show or for someone who doesn\u2019t care if the ink bleeds/smudges.

First of all, if you want to go out of business then this is the product for you. I will explain how,  payroll calculations are off.  I paid my employees the same amount of salaries for years, switched to QB and the sums have all changed.  To run tax reports off!!!  I\u2019m sure this is done on purpose so you will have to pay for their services. I don\u2019t like the way it try\u2019s to sell me stuff while I am trying to post, unprofessional. Something\u2019s been on mine trying to sell me stuff back from Memorial Day, and sure weird pop ups, buy this now??  Ok the kicker is you can\u2019t make invoices in advanced and when you try it double makes them. It does not tell you when a group of invoices are due, it just tells you all are due; ones  that are already prepaid and posted. Sure send a customer an invoice for services they had already paid for \ud83d\ude2c. Plus if you have different amount of set monthly  invoices, let\u2019s say some are $10, 15, 20, you can\u2019t not batch them all together, it all has to be done separate, and if you do it changes everyone\u2019s invoice.  Major pain. It triples invoices all at different amounts, Completely flawed. However,I will tell you what this program is good for, if you do not want to be in control of your payroll and outsource it, all at a fee. If you just want to create invoices on demand and not have any control over your books. It is good if you have no idea what you are doing because neither does it.

The smell is pure sugar, which kind of surprised me, since it has so many different oils in it. But, like I said, it is fairly dry in the jar. It is easy to scoop out, and if you spread it between your hands before scrubbing on your body, it does moisten right up, and the sugar starts to dissolve, which would be why it is such a dry scrub. I was impressed with the soft smoothness of my skin after using the scrub, considering the sugar was dissolving, but it did work. My skin has a faint sweet aroma, but, due to the initial dryness and low oil quantity in the packaging, it did not moisturize as much as I would have liked.

There is nothing that I can find that says that this stuff has argan oil. Lastly is that supposedly has tea tree oil. I didn't even need to look anything up to know that this body wash does not have it in there. The big one being that, while the soap smells nice, it smells NOTHING like tee tree oil. Tea Tree oil has a very strong and distinct smell. I use it for a lot of stuff, so I know what it smells like. Then there is the fact that based off of glancing at the ingredients. Tea Tree oil is not listed by it's common or scientific name. So unless this company is counting the front of the bottle as part of the ingredients list, this does not contain what it says it does.

Yesterday (weeks later), I got an email asking me to review it, so today I decided to try it. I opened the box and the bottle was sealed in plastic and taped. There were gloves with it. I was even more nervous! LOL. I gave my hair a quick wash in the shower (no gloves) and I did have to spray down the whole area, as everything was purple, but it rinsed right off. My hair felt squeaky afterwards (I did not condition) and when I dried it, I did notice that the brassiness was gone. I only left it in my hair for a minute or so while washing. I guess I was scared for nothing. I think I would use it once a week to keep the tone cooler.

I will be buying it again.", "text": "As of today, I have used these Sdara Hydrating Face Masks on two separate occasions.  The first thing I noticed was that it stayed in place on my face better than the mask from a different brand I had used previously.  The Sdara mask seems to be of a somewhat thinner material and it is well saturated with the hydrating ingredients.  Due to both these factors, it molds to the surface of the face more completely, as well as probably staying in place more easily.<br /><br />After sitting with the mask on for a while, I experienced a noticeable soothing sensation on my skin.  I found this to be pleasant and relaxing.<br /><br />The directions on the back of the packet containing the mask say to leave it on for 25-30 minutes.  From my two times experience with this product, I have to agree with that.  One time I left it on for more than 30 minutes and noticed a kind of astringent sensation on my skin.  The mask is not meant to be on for longer than 30 minutes.<br /><br />The directions written on the back of the packet are clear and easy to understand.  I was also thrilled to see that the mask is 100 percent biodegradable and cruelty free (no harsh laboratory testing on animals).<br /><br />Looking at the results afterward, my skin definitely looked less dry and felt softer.

And they had tried EVERYTHING, with no relief at all. I have known for some years about the healing powers of colloidal silver in all of its many forms.  So I sent them both a couple of jars of this cream to apply to their rashes. In fact, I sent them multiple options of topical and internal \u201cnatural\u201d/non-pharma remedies to try.  (Because that is my thing, and they knew it.).  Both have reported back to me that it gave them literal IMMEDIATE, though not permanent, relief from the pain and itching when they apply this cream - so much so that they have re-ordered in larger quantities.  The rash is much improved, and far better than it was, but so far, after more than a month, not completely cured. They are still quite grateful to have this cream to provide relief when the rash flares up again.  And it seems to be the only thing that does help, after trying numerous remedies, including from the doctor.

Here is why I like these better than other stamp sets I've tried:<br /> 1. They have more stencils, and the one I use fits perfectly.  Other stencils packs have had fewer selection of eyebrow stencils and they are too big for my face.<br />2. They have two stencils of the same shape!  I have never had a stencil kit with this.  That way you use one for one eyebrow, and a different stencil for the other.  With other kits you have to use the same stencil and wipe it of makeup, otherwise you get unwanted makeup on your face.<br /> 2. Other stencils have this space across them that you have to fill in at the arch.  I am not sure why they are all have this.  These stencils do not have that space that I have to fill in, so I literally stamp and done.<br /><br />This is very easy to use.

Fortunately I did not spend much on them.<br />So I think these would work fine for you if you do not have a small, narrow face like me.  Also, it does take a little practice to get the hang of putting these on. I hope that makes sense and helps you make your decision.", "images": [], "asin": "B07WDFZQCR", "parent_asin": "B07WDFZQCR", "user_id": "AEC6DLIXZNOWHAMA43D3TGQHHIIQ", "timestamp": 1576337646281, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Better than shiseido and klairs", "text": "These are the best cotton pads! Like other reviewers, I follow a korean skincare routine which uses up lots of toner and essence. The special material of these cotton pads does not absorb the product and instead releases it like a sponge. There is no waste, and the amount of product I have to use is drastically less than when using Shiseido cotton pads. The closest comparison I can make to this product is the Klairs 2 in 1 cotton pads. Klairs gives you two different kinds of cotton pads in a box, one of which is sponge-y and the other which is good for exfoliation.  I liked the Klairs pads, but I couldn't find an option that would let me purchase *just* the sponge-y ones. It was very annoying, because then I'd end up with a bunch of exfoliating pads I didn't want to use. These Silcot pads are the same as the Klairs sponge pads but even better! So happy I found these! Just a word of caution: do NOT buy these pads for removing makeup! These cotton pads are very thin and designed for a different purpose!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A nice and elegant brush that works great!", "text": "[[VIDEOID:3e9c3dec1f15e9a69de3043202449644]] This brush is elegant and very efficient it has 5 different heating levels ranging starting at 250F for thin hair and going all the way up 450F for thick coarse hair. I straighten all my hair in less than 15 minutes and I was able to get my roots which is a plus for me, this brush left my hair nice and silky taking all the frizz out. I usually have to bump my other hair straighteners all the way to 450 but with this one I was able to straighten all my hair at 390F and that made me real happy! This brush came well packed in a really nice box and brings included two hair clips, one Heat  resistant glove, one little brush for cleaning, one beautiful storage bag for your brush and the Manual. This brush once you have the set temperature it locks automatically which is great that way you are not raising or lowering the temperature while using the brush and it also shuts off by it self after 30 minutes of non use. This is a really good quality brush that does not pull on the hair and straightens with just 1 or 2 strokes.<br />***I got this brush at a Discount/Free in exchange of my honest review and that is the reason why I'm including a video so that you can see for your self how amazing this brush works and I totally recommend it.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715UEyRFeyL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715UEyRFeyL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715UEyRFeyL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2ts4oTKL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2ts4oTKL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2ts4oTKL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFtbzFh5L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFtbzFh5L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFtbzFh5L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AgN4eNWVL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AgN4eNWVL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AgN4eNWVL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01C8404OC", "parent_asin": "B01C8404OC", "user_id": "AHVNNEQM5ATDHT6BPCYGIGNEL62A", "timestamp": 1465426248000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}

Actual ingredients not clearly listed.", "text": "I bought this because the seller listed the main ingredients as argan oil and resvesterol, when in fact the product is full of silicon and demethicone is listed before argan oil. I can see why there are rave reviews from other users.  This will give your hair a great TEMPORARY shine and silky soft feel but will end up robbing it of shine shortly and prevent your hair from absorbing moisture. You are not coating your hair with Arian oil but a rubber derivative. So th cuticle lays down short term but never gets the moisture that is causing the damage and frizz to begin with. I think someone who has science in their name would know that. Long term demethicone use will cause more drying and damage and is not good for your hair.<br /><br />I had actually wanted to use this product on my face, not hair because of the resvesterol. But it has an extremely strong scent of sandalwood that is overpowering and I would never be able to use it on my face.<br /><br />The bottle arrived in a box but leaked all over. I would have returned anyway because of the demethicone and smell. I bought pure cold pressed argan oil to use instead. It smells naturally like poo as all of them do but the smell dissipates in a few minutes.<br /><br />I do think the seller should make its ingredients clear to prospective buyers and not just list the deceptive &#34;main ingredients&#34; omitting the ingredients that are listed first when the package actually arrives and therefore are really the main ingredients.", "images": [], "asin": "B00KQW9ZKI", "parent_asin": "B00KQW9ZKI", "user_id": "AEVSAUHP7CVL25ACX7Z4SFIC2Z2A", "timestamp": 1464370080000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

The brushes are soft to the touch and they clearly state they are synthetic bristles. They look decently made as well though there is a chemical smell I will have to air off. The smell might be the case, it is just a vinyl/plastic case but the case is pretty and not stiff which is nice I like the double magnetic closure feature. Be aware there are no small brushes in this such as an eyeliner or brow brush, these are all decent size brushes though the bristles are a bit short on the larger brushes and I will use these more for blending. The handles are long enough that they feel good in my hand, I prefer a full handle for powders which these have. I will switch a few out of these for travel to have the smaller ones I use and have a perfect set and then there will be some nice additions to my home makeup brush collection for blending when I contour. There is also a brush description for each one so you know what they are theoretically to be used for and a card that says if you are not happy for any reason to contact the company.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow! Just get them!", "text": "Who knew waxing with a small metal spatula would be so great?<br />Why does this matter?<br />I\u2019m no stranger to self waxing. I\u2019ve mostly used microwaveable waxes with wooden applicators. In case you were not aware, waxing is messy, even for a person who tries to be meticulous and keep things neat while involved with this task.<br />Let me take a moment to get this out before I go any further ... Bwahahahahaha<br />Ok.<br />I recently treated myself to a wax warmer because I wanted to wax larger areas and not have to run to the microwave frequently. Since the warmer pot is metal,the spatula can be scraped and kept reasonably clean during the waxing process. This also means that the wax on the spatula is not hardened and inhibiting the hot wax application (if you keep up with it).<br /><br />The Nitry Gritty...<br />- You are not wasting time! I cannot stress enough that time is something once spent, can\u2019t be recovered. It\u2019s precious!!<br />- You are not struggling to apply wax (as much as that\u2019s possible)!<br />- This is small enough to allow quick, controlled applications in multiple areas while you wait for it to cool. Then rip away!<br />- Small enough to do parts of the face, but not under the eyebrows.<br />- Enough control to allow what you choose for size, direction, thickness and a little thicker pulling edge with minimal struggling. Tapered shape is very helpful. Not a flimsy product, very well made.<br />- Perfect to use with a wax warmer because the metal pot heats the metal spatula and makes cleaning it so much easier!<br /><br />If anyone is wondering, I used this with Kolua Wax (hard) sold here on Amazon.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great for those suffering from seborrheic dermatitis or eczema", "text": "I first purchased this soap at a Beauty Supply store near my house to use solely as a facial cleanser. I have a condition called Seborrheic Dermatitis, which causes raised, red, flaky rashes around my nose and mouth. It's similar to eczema and can be embarrassing, itchy, and uncomfortable. I treated it with medication prescribed by a dermatologist but after graduating from college, I suddenly found myself uninsured. I had heard about the effectiveness of both black soap and tea tree oil in treating various skin conditions like mine, so I was intrigued by a soap that provided both.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is how unprocessed it was compared to other black soap I've seen. This looks as if it's all natural. I've never used black soap before so I can't compare it to other products in anyway except appearance and price. Erzuli wasn't as pretty but it was more affordable.<br /><br />So the bottom line is...IT WORKS! It has completely tamed my seborrheic dermatitis as well or better than the steroidal medication I had been prescribed by my dermatologist, except without the cost and side effects.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />1) It feels odd. Perhaps, it's the tea tree oil but it feels as if there's some type of film over my face when I'm using it. It's not a bad feeling, just different than regular soap. At least in my head, it makes me feel as if my skin is actually getting moisturized.<br /><br />2) A little goes a very long way. This soap lasts forever....well at least if you only use it on your face like me. It lathers up like crazy. So don't waste it. I usually just rub it in my hands a couple times and than rub my hands together, which produces more than enough lather to wash my face. One bar has lasted months.<br /><br />3) It's messy. This is probably the biggest downside. The texture of this product is not like traditional soap. It becomes \"gummy\" after being exposed to water. I can literally take the bar of soap and bend it. It can actually get quite messy so I had to by a container to put the soap in which starts to look quite gross after a while.<br /><br />4) It tingles. I've heard black soap can tingle/burn a little, I definitely know tea tree oil can. So the two together means that if you leave it on your face for too long, it may start to burn a little. It's nothing too intense and for all I know, that might just mean it's working but I do try to let it sit on my face for only a minute or two before washing it off.<br /><br />5) The smell. There is not a strong tea tree oil smell, which for me is a plus. I wasn't sure what to expect but the scent is mild and inoffensive.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from a skin condition similar to mine. I just bought the pack of 2 here on Amazon, which was slightly more expensive than I had seen at the brick and mortar store but they were out of stock, and I couldn't bare the thought of running out. This is my new my secret weapon to having healthy looking skin. 5 stars!", "images": [], "asin": "B00IAA79JC", "parent_asin": "B00IAA79JC", "user_id": "AFIEU7P4FWBXHQBWJPZP6USHDHYA", "timestamp": 1413035449000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I Like I-Fill", "text": "This is my review of the Ifill K-Cup user fill system.  All in all, the system delivers a steady clean means of filling K-Cup bodies with coffee.  Below I will compare my experience with 4 different scenarios for drinking coffee from a K-Cup system<br /><br />1. A standard dark roast K-cup cartridge.  This was a non-Keurig brand that contained 10.76 grams of coffee.  The coffee was of reasonable flavor, very convenient to use, and with no mess to make, the capsule is too complicated to recycle. Most expensive system to use $0.50 to more than $1.00 per serving.<br />2. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen.  -  User filled screen capsule.  Somewhat messy to fill, brews reasonable tasting coffee, but will leave a little sediment of ground in your cup.  Holds 10.20 grams of coffee. The system is a pain to clean out.  Least expensive system as the screen cup may be reused many times over.<br />3. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen with added paper filter \u2013 User filled screen capsule with disposable paper filter that fits inside of the plastic screen capsule.  Takes a while to get the hang of fitting the filter into the capsule.  The system holds a little less coffee at 10.06 grams of coffee. The drinkable coffee produced has very little sediment in your cup.  This system is a little bit easier to clean up, but not much.  The filter cup removes fairly easily, but there is still a fair amount of rinsing of the plastic capsule to get rid of the coffee grounds that are on the top of the capsule lid.  Slightly more expensive due to having to purchase filters.<br />4. The IFill Cup -  The is a user fillable cup single use system.  The cup has a preinstalled filter that does well producing sediment free coffee.  The attached lid is made of foil that is supported by a plastic ring that is hinged to the IFill cup body.  Each lid has a very effective gummy seal that works well during the brewing process to keep coffee ground contained within the IFill Cup. After filling with grounds, the caps stay sealed to the cup body and seem to be shelf stable for more than a week.  So just fill a bunch in one session and you off to caffeine heaven for another week.  There is some potential mess when originally filling new cups, but the ability to simple toss the used cup without any mess is a great plus.  A lightly filled cup held 10.86 grams of coffee.  At this fill there seem to be very few leaks when the brew process is working.  A very densely packed and somewhat overfilled cup held 14.72 grams.  In this situation there was some leaking from the cup lid at the water insertion point, but this cup was fill to the point of abuse.  I believe this system is more expensive than using an Echo Cup but is much less hassle to use.  The system is less expensive than using factory filled K-cups.  So if you want to know what is in your KCup every morning, and don\u2019t mind setting down and filling new capsules with coffee every once in a while \u2013 this is your system!<br /><br />Can you reuse an IFIll cup?  I guess you could, but I am not sure that hassle of cleaning out, drying, and hoping that the single use gum seal would work well would be worth the bother.<br /><br />Can you recycle the product?  The company says yes, in reality I would guess that being most other KCup devices are not recyclable when the cup finally gets to the recycle guy for sorting, they are going to \u201cThink KCup\u201d and sort it directly into the trash.<br /><br />All in all, the IFill seems to be a great user fill KCup system.  Nice flavor from your own beans, easy setup, use and disposal of the product.  \u2013 I will be reordering more soon!", "images": [], "asin": "B00XNQX7US", "parent_asin": "B00XNQX7US", "user_id": "AE6QUS7S2CMWBBXNYR3K64A5BNHQ", "timestamp": 1448110925000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Needs Work", "text": "I thought this product was the answer to a problem....but it wasn't.<br /><br />TBH, its a great idea....but there are a couple flaws that need to be addressed. First, the claim that it will stick to all tub or shower surfaces is a fallacy that most people who own fiberglass tubs and showers should know. If you have a slippery tile or enamel floor to your bathtub or shower you will be good to go. But who wants to have a slippery shower floor?<br /><br />The second flaw is the curved piece that sits over the base.  If it had been designed properly, that piece would have been made from a bendable silicone so that if your foot hit it you wouldn't end up cursing a blue streak.

Only cons for me are that it's a little difficult to get on the diffuser but once it's on its all good and the price is a little high for my liking. However, It's worth it since it works well!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Unique Mask for All Ages", "text": "This MagiForet Star Mask is meant to help firm, lift, and tone your face. As I age I don\u2019t mind the wrinkles or even the age spots. What I do mind is my sagging skin. Yes, having jowls terrifies me. This Star Mask was more comfortable than I thought it would be. You put a layer on and let it set between 20-30 minutes until it is completely dry. Usually, I can only stand to wear a mask 10 minutes, but this mask was so comfortable that I dozed off with it on. I woke up just in time to remove.<br /><br />Removal was a little difficult and made me wonder how tugging on my skin actually helped with firming, toning, and lifting. I\u2019ve only had a chance to try this mask once so I cannot say that it\u2019s going to keep the jowls at bay. What positive results I did have was my face was so soft and bright after removing this mask. Best of all my overly sensitive skin wasn\u2019t irritated in the least. It is a mask that I am going to incorporate into my skincare routine and hopefully, the jowls never appear.  You need such a small amount of this mask that the 1.7 fl oz jar should last you through many maskings.  Also, the jar is so pretty it can sit on your vanity and no one will be the wiser that you have a black glittery gel inside.<br /><br />The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the glitter was uncomfortable during application. Some of the larger sized glitters would catch and scratch your skin until they laid down. Not to the point of marks or blood.

Since I rely on reviews from Amazon, I'm including mine to help others.<br />My colors are the first photo-Shady and Starburst.<br />My first attempt was with Shady and I did a great job on my left hand, but didn't smooth out the right enough. It held up well, but I only got a week out of it because I couldn't deal with the bad job I'd done on my right hand.<br />The second photo is the second time I did my nails and first time I used Starburst. Glitter is more forgiving.  I realized that with two coats of the color, you could still see the white of my nail through it. The second time I used this color, I used a white base (Fresh Cotton from Sally's). This second time is the grid photo with the purple/silver.<br /><br />From start to finish (with bare nails) this takes about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Advice:<br />1-Watch YouTube tutorials. All systems have different instructions, so they might not all apply to your kit. Keep that in mind as you watch them.<br />2-Let the dip dry before you brush off the excess. I didn't do that before, but employed that advice my third time (purple/silver photo) and it was a better experience.<br />3-Don't do this without a good buffer. A plain old nail file ain't gonna cut it!<br />4-I bought nail clips to hold the acetone-soaked cotton on my nails and it works way better than foil. I can do all my nails at once.<br />5-Before stating dip polish, after washing hands, wipe nails with alcohol pad. It gets all the oils off your nails.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Low cost, quality OEM replacement", "text": "SUMMARY:<br />I found these blades to be a much lower cost, good-excellent quality alternative to stock Gillette blades.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE?  Note, however, I always perform proper cleaning maintenance after each shave.  To wit: I brush off the blades using the tooth brush bristles to get in between the blades, then blow on it a few times to clear off most of any remaining water droplets.  This greatly retards oxidation and corrosion of the blade edges.  For anyone groaning right now, that &#34;whole big process&#34; takes all of 10 seconds!  That's fast by any measure.<br /><br />LIFE:<br />Using the above standard methodology of use, I got just as long a use per blade as stock Gillette's ... roughly 2 months per blade ..  before there is a any hint of snagging, rather than cutting, my hairs.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />I found the slightly larger size of the blade head felt a bit odd but only on the very 1st shave.  It soon felt good, even reassuring, as it provided a broader surface to go over my skin.<br /><br />CUTS?<br />One reviewer said they cut him easily.  I, too, have been cut, but it was by the stock Gillette blades. Frankly, it's going to happen with any blade ... eventually.  Some units of any make blades will be slightly off on rare occasion or have inconsistent edges than can cut or scratch.  Then, there's the matter of user technique.<br /><br />After 4-5 decades on this earth, a shaver should get a sense of their skin hairs, how they slant, how sensitive the skin is underneath, and, most importantly, how tough their skin has become.  These things are even more critical for women who are forced to shave areas infinitely more sensitive than those of men. Mature adults usually have tougher skin from loss of collagen, sun degradation, and for simply having shaved many 1,000's of times.  Younger shavers tend to have sensitive skin and are less attuned to the proper angles at which to pull the shaver to deal with their skin profile.<br /><br />I took the above side trip to highlight that for some, the minutest difference in blades could cause some shavers to cut themselves - not necessarily due to blade defects or construction style but, perhaps, simply because they have not spent as much time adapting their technique to a new blade as they did to their previous one.  That is, days or weeks versus many years!  Remember how many times new shavers cut themselves when 1st shaving?  The same experiential curve applies to those changing blade models - not matter their age or shaving experience level.<br /><br />VALUE:<br />So far, for me, these low cost blades are a tremendous value. Plus I bought a 5 pack for $0.97 on a 1-time CVS sale. Then bought another at the regular (way cheaper than OEM) price of $16 for 10.  So, I'm good for another 1.25 years at 2 months per blade.<br /><br />COST PER SHAVE:<br />Excluding the clearance price I got on a 5-pack, the $16 price for 10 = $1.60 each.  With a mean time to replacement of 2 months (for me), that equates to $1.60 / 60 days = $0.0267 cents per shave or roughly $0.81 / month or $9.74 / year.<br /><br />BLADE AGING PROFILE:<br />The &#34;newness&#34; feeling and sharpness wore off at about the same rate as do my Gillette blades.<br />To wit: 1-5 shaves = feels like new using 2-3 strokes/pass<br />  5-20 = 3-4 strokes/pass<br />20-40 = 4-5 strokes/pass<br />40-60 = 5-6 strokes/pass<br />Only then do I toss and replace unless, of course, I come upon a blade that seems to have aged quicker for whatever reason.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />They look, feel, and age not much differently than Gillette blades and cost 50-75% less.  Look for CVS in-store at your local branch then check Amazon to ensure you find the lowest cost.", "images": [], "asin": "B078VZMJKN", "parent_asin": "B078VZMJKN", "user_id": "AGMU3GG4QZRUH7I2QQUTE4JQNCYQ", "timestamp": 1524437192226, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

One claim from the promo text I do somewhat question is that of \u201cperfectly moisturized skin.\u201d I would have to say that any moisturizing properties are just average, not exceptional. Part of the evaluation criteria is assessing thickness and packaging. Thickness is exactly what I would expect it to be, remaining where it\u2019s poured lying atop a washcloth and neither running off nor penetrating the cloth until appropriate action is taken. As for the packaging, the design appeal of colors and shape get high marks. Unfortunately, my bottle is one where the pump would never fully unlock, dispensing only a minute amount at a time, which is both impractical and extremely frustrating. I\u2019ve had to remove the pump and pour, which is much less efficient.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pretty, long-lasting, subtle color", "text": "I tend to not wear a lot of eyeshadow, so when I do, I gravitate towards very neutral, but slightly shimmery colors. I was therefore really excited to try this product.<br /><br />The product comes in this adorable little plastic container with a fun image of a cat on it. There is a small mirror on the inside of the lid. I appreciate that the container latches securely, so bits of loose powder don't get all over the place in my makeup bag. I would, however, appreciate if they found a way to fit a tiny applicator somewhere in the underside of the container. I had to dig one out from my makeup drawer.<br /><br />This is an eyeshadow duo with a slightly pinker, and a more taupe-y shade. As you can see from the pic, these colors are very, very subtle on paler skin like mine. However, there is a nice shimmer to them that makes it stand out a bit.  I like that the eyeshadow is pretty clingy and didn't get all over my face when I was applying it. It is long-lasting--at the end of the work day, it still is quite noticeable when I look in the mirror.<br /><br />Currently, the eyeshadow is retailing at about $22.

I've been scratching my head trying to figure out what the ingredient is, but something in these masks are whitening my skin! :D The mask itself is gauze-like and has tiny speckles in it, but it's not an impurity or defect, it's embedded in the fabric itself. The aluminum packaging is crinkly, but IOPE explains that it's due to their sterilization process (they sterilize the masks in the packaging).<br /><br />I've tried many many Korean masks, but I've never had one whiten my skin the way this one does. It whitens by making my pores disappear. At first I thought some kind of white substance must be filling in my pores, but the essence is clear and even if I rub the product off my skin, the pores are still gone (not visible). Either my pores are getting super cleaned or super tightened. I'm excited either way by these masks. I don't have acne or sensitive skin, but I do have large pores from harsh acne treatments 10 years ago. These masks make my skin look like snow without those ugly blackheads showing. I can't stop staring at the mirror when I take the mask off, it's the one time I can admire an evenly-toned whitened skin.<br /><br />There's a ton of essence in each mask by the way (I mean a TON) so I like to pour it in a spray bottle and save it for mist for makeup application.

I try to organize stuff on the weekends so I can just grab and go every morning while packing my lunch for work.<br />These containers are going to be great for my purpose, I can tell already! They hold a tad more than half a cup (I poured 1/2 cup water in one to test it and there was still a small amount of room above the water line). The included liner is fantastic. I only tested one container so far, but it was the one I put 1/2 cup of water in. I put the liner on the container, screwed the top on and turned it upside down, sideways, and shook it. No leakage! Very impressive. I probably won't use liquid in these containers but it's nice to know they don't leak if I find a liquid I want to put in them. I might just take yogurt in them!<br /><br />I've included pictures so you can see the size, how well they are made and how they came packaged. There was bubble wrap around the package of containers, then they were in plastic under the bubble wrap also. I had to get my scissors out to get into the bubble wrap, it was on securely.<br />The containers themselves seem to be a medium thick plastic, definitely not flimsy. There is nothing on them to indicate the type of plastic they are made of, but Houseables says they are made of polypropylene and safe for spices, cooking oils, etc. The Livestrong website states &#34;Polypropylene containers do not leach harmful chemicals into foods or liquids. They commonly contain yogurt, medicine, drinks, ketchup and medicines.&#34;<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the included liners, as I imagined they would be the same type of liners you get in the top of some medicine bottles - a thin piece of waterproof paper that won't last long. The liners in these containers are great! I've included a picture of them as well.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but I feel they are totally worth the full price of $11.99. I was planning on buying them anyway and was pleased to get a discount. If I didn't like them, I would tell you that too. A review is no good if it's not honest. If they break easily or something else happens that causes my opinion of them to change, I'll update my review to reflect that.<br /><br />One of the photos has a green [[ASIN:B00FP2RMUY Gotubb 3-Pack, Multi, Medium]] on top of these, so if you are familiar with Gotubbs you can judge the size of the Houseables jars a bit better. I love my Gotubbs and how they open with one hand, but they do cost a lot more than these Houseables jars. If you are looking for a lot of storage for a low price, this is the product to get!<br /><br />**Update** I'm still using these containers and they are still as great as ever! I am watching my weight and these help me keep track of my food intake and make it easy to grab and go with a premeasured amount of food. They hold a single serving size of wheat thins perfectly, are handy for a scoop of slim fast powder and two teaspoons of Benefiber mixed together (I use the included liners for this application), hold a serving of Hershey Kisses and come in handy for a lot more! I love to prepackage this stuff then grab and go in the mornings.

I read a lot of reviews (thanks to everyone!) and decided to try Khaki Brown #4. And guess what! It's great! It's definitely a different color than the other but there's no orange and it looks great, probably even better than the Grey one. Whew!<br /><br />(Original post)  I've tried quite a few but this is my favorite eyebrow pencil so far. It does wipe off easily, but if you keep your hands off it doesn't disappear, change color or fade like others. I love the grey (which is actually a taupe on my skin. I have naturally black brows which are thinning and even some hairs are now grey and I really hate it. When I use this pencil they look more natural than the others. (My hair is silvery white grey, was black when younger.) I don't feel the color looks so harsh as flat grey or black pencils and doesn't turn orange like some browns I've tried.  I use the small end to outline and the other to fill in. I hoped to use the small to draw individual brow hairs but the pencil is quite soft and does not really work like that. Turned out not to be a problem though and at least it doesn't pull out hairs when applying.", "images": [], "asin": "B07JLYP98Q", "parent_asin": "B07JLYP98Q", "user_id": "AGWXUEAEESAEXYYQBN3MBU5J2FDQ", "timestamp": 1547773164734, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Super shave quality, deceptively quiet, and goes forever on a charge.", "text": "I can't think when I last rated any product with all five stars but this one gets them!<br /><br />I have always used \"foil\" shavers over the past 30 or so years and they have varied widely in the quality of shave. Only one would I have rated at the top for shave quality that approached blade shaving and that one was purchased about 24 years ago. I never gave multi-head rotary shavers much thought...until this one. This shaver beats EVERY electric shaver I haver ever owned or tried for shave quality...even \"dry\" (without using any kind of pre-shave). With a pre-shave lotion it is even better. This is a great on-the-road shaver to keep in your car for those super-quick erasures of 6-o'clock shadows.<br /><br />This thing is super quiet. It doesn't \"buzz\" but the sound it does make is a very quiet one that makes you think it is running at a slow speed...yet it races right through a 3-day growth as fast as you can \"mow\" your face. The rotor housing pops right off and you just shake the stubs out if you have been using dry or only with pre-shave. If you use it in the shower...well, rinse it off in there!<br /><br />Battery life so far has been unexpectedly good. It has a countdown charge timer built into the on-off switch that starts at 60 (supposed minutes) but after a good estimated half hour of shaving mine only ticked down to about 43 before I plugged it in to my laptop to charge. It only comes with a USB charging corder (it's proprietary at one end so don't lose it!) that can plug into any power-providing standard USB port. Many hotels now have USB charging ports on their bathroom outlets and you even find them on things like inexpensive power strips. Of course, you can purchase a standalone USB charger...but I see no need in my case give this thing seems to just \"sip\" power and would likely last a multi-week business trip without the need to charge.<br /><br />Its flip out trimmer is rather smallish but gets the job done and trims very closely. Works as well as any I have tried/owned.<br /><br />I don't see a real downside to this shaver. I don't know (haven't checked) where you might find additional rotary blades if you need them but the shaver is so inexpensive you could buy five or six whole shavers for the price of other \"mid range\" rotaries I have tried that don't give as good a shave.<br /><br />Unless you are a real brand-loyalist or your current shaver gives what you consider a \"perfect\" this is THE ONE TO GET.", "images": [], "asin": "B07K1DRCYR", "parent_asin": "B07K1DRCYR", "user_id": "AEG25N6DVTQ6LCP2BPOWVV3OE7HA", "timestamp": 1571369591268, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
