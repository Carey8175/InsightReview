You can just design the pouf with a hole in the middle, so it fits over the little knob on the interior lid. Problem solved. Until there's an update, I might just try to diy.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Painful, needs eye protection, hard to read and unclear manual", "text": "I am interested in red light therapy. We all want to look younger, right? But, I feel like this was a bad idea.<br /><br />It comes in a box labeled \"Colorful LED Beauty Mask\" rather than the one pictured in the main listing photo. There doesn't seem to be a company name on anything. The product looks the same and the box I received is shown in other photos, so I believe I got the right thing.<br /><br />As the manual says, \"Normal people use or stop using, ask the doctor after doctor.\" Yes, the manual is that poorly translated. I'm O.K. with a little grammar error here and there, but this was hard to understand. It doesn't make one feel confident in the quality. I don't even think it mentioned the microcurrent pegs. Do you need to use them or are they optional? What do they do? I really don't know after reading the manual.<br /><br />I can tell you that without the pegs in, the eye part dug in and felt horrible. I adjusted the mask strap to very loose, so it wasn't that. With the pegs in, the pegs in my forehead dug in and left marks that lasted over 30 minutes later, and one spot was still sore the next day. The microcurrent on just the lowest setting was a bit uncomfortable. Maybe it would be better when wearing a face mask, which is encouraged and which I had wanted to try.<br /><br />The eye holes do not block all the light from my eyes. The manual says to close eyes or use pads or eye shades. Dermatologists actually say to use blackout or opaque goggles.<br /><br />I didn't find it that heavy. Just awkward and painful. As others have mentioned, this is better lying down, since you can't open your eyes anyways. But, it's still not comfortable. It's also strange that the cord is only 3 1/2 feet, or maybe almost 4 feet stretched out. If I was to use it in bed, I'd need an extension cord.<br /><br />I can suffer a little for beauty, but I'm worried about the safety of this given the poor instructions, poor design and unknown origins. I can't recommend this for anyone, but in particular it is prohibited for pregnant women, children, thyroid disease, light allergic, drug users, and those with skin trauma (see photo).

No tangles in the hair, no rips in the cap and no loose weft.<br />My only recommendation is that you do a little diy and sew in some wig clips, (not wig combs). Two clips are good, but three clips are better. (Front and both sides).<br />The cap can easily slide off your head...a strong swish of wind, a snag or an adjustment of the lid is cause for a devastating, but quite hilarious reveal! Even on the tightest setting for my head, the cap EASILY slid off.<br />Without the wig clips, I wouldn't chance wearing this anywhere other than sitting at your desk on a video chat. No sudden moves thought. Lol<br />I will definitely be purchasing this cap unit again. I love the look and convenience of popping it on and going! I don't mind the DIY wig clips. It's worth the trouble, although I think the manufacturer should already have this installed in their caps.<br />Wear with caution, but you'll look cute and stylish for sure!!", "images": [], "asin": "B08GZV2C44", "parent_asin": "B08GZV2C44", "user_id": "AGGPMJZOXULE6FWRHDOSHLMY2FNA", "timestamp": 1623423693371, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

I decided that I wanted something with a motor that would really get the job done.  Most of the products I found had mediocre to bad reviews until I found this one.  I decided to give it a try.  Now that I have it I don't think I'll even use a foot file again!  It is very easy to use and works to file the skin away with ease.  I love the adjustable speed.  I keep it about a third of the way up.  The first time I used it (with the course disc) I had the speed set higher and my skin became very warm and felt like it was burning to I turned it down to a slower speed.  The fine disc I can use at a higher speed.  I can file my feel in a few minutes and they look and feel great.  I have used it 4 times so far and both of the discs seem like new, so I suspect that I won't need to buy refills for a while.

Second, when heated the recommended 20 seconds, the heat only lasts about 10 minutes before it's no longer warm enough. To heat any longer than 19-20 seconds would be too long.

Very little oil production.<br />\u2014I\u2019m new to Vitamin C serums. I began using this product daily. It dried out/irritated my skin. I cut back to 2-3x/week (after a skin a little break). The dryness and irritation went away.<br />\u2014For those accustomed to Vitamin C serums- this might not be an issue.<br />\u2014I also followed the recommendations to refrigerate after opening to prolong longevity (Vitamin C is very unstable in liquid form)<br />\u2014I\u2019m into Naturopathy and clean skin scare products. There were no questionable ingredients on the box label (via EWG SkinDeep website).<br />\u2014I\u2019ve researched different forms of Vitamin C: serums and powders with and without feurlic acid to understand what to look for in a Vitamin C serum.<br />Pro\u2019s<br />EWG SkinDeep database check came back Good. (ingredient list label is difficult to read. One ingredient wasn\u2019t recognized in EWG)<br />Dark glass bottle with screw on lid.

No oiliness....very liquidity.<br />Ample size- 1.01 fluid ounces<br />Easy to apply- 2-3 drops is sufficient<br />Sinks into skin quickly<br />Improvement of rough patches (face feels smoother)- thinking of trying this on back of hands.<br />Works with my current skincare products (facial wash, toner, facial oil, mask 2x/week)<br />Solution has not turned brown or discolored (kept refrigeration)<br />My skin feels tighter (firmness)<br /><br />Cons:<br />A slight odor, I can\u2019t place<br />Not a significant difference in wrinkle improvement (50- beginning of smile lines, chin and forehead wrinkles).<br />No feurlic acid (this has been shown to work synergistically with Vitamin C)<br />Lasts 3 months and needs refrigeration (expiration date is on box)...since very little is needed and use is 2-3x/week- I expect it will expire before all product is used.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Smaller Pores !!!!", "text": "Let me start off by saying I have combination skin and have not had great luck with many mud masks, but, Dead Sea mud seems to be what works for me. Ok I've had luck with a couple mud masks on here and one of those I really liked but,... I can only use the one I really loved every couple of months because it has peel like ingredients and that's not the type of mask to use weekly or bi weekly . This type of mask could be used at least weekly without harsh affects. I was definitely skeptical about the smaller pores claim but it's true !!!! I had my daughter do a video on her iPod and even though it wasn't really noticeable in the mirror afterwards to me at least, on the video the larger pores I have were actually smaller. I cannot figure out how to upload a video from anything other then my iPad so later this week I'm going to get a video or pictures on my iPad so I can post the difference. It's crazy how a mud can do this much without me noticing any major intenseness that I get from my other favorite mud mask, so pretty much I'm getting results without the burning, oh and this is also WAY more then what I get in the jar of my other stuff. So a. It's more, b. It's more affordable, c. It's easier on my skin and yeah you get the picture,. This is definitely the best mud mask you can get for the money and it really shrinks your pores, or my pores at least. My combination skin feels good and &#34;normal&#34; for two to three days after. Now that might not be a lot to you, but for me it's a miracle because usually by day two I'm oily on my problem areas and that's not fun. I highly recommend this mask to anyone looking for an affordable mask that'll last a long time, meaning it's not a ridiculously small jar.I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me.

By smell picked this as my favorite. Tried it first.<br /><br />Made certain to lather my hair well. It's long to mid back. I'm in my mid-fifties.

Sharing this because this may affect shampoos.<br /><br />Anyhow, used that bar on the top and under the back and made certain my hair was soapy, and rinsed it completely.<br /><br />My long hair was matted to my head.<br /><br />This is not normal. I've tried other bar soap to wash my hair before and the effect is similar. I'm wondering if it's because of the ingredients of soap.<br /><br />I slathered lots of conditioning balm on my now gauze-textured hair.<br /><br />In about five minutes my hair was soft and manageable. Able to run fingers through it.<br /><br />If I was a man this would work probably. Maybe other women with different textured hair would function better than mine did following shampooing with this bar.<br /><br />I've got three others to try, so who knows.<br /><br />My preferred shampoo is this brand in the bottle in the honey variety.<br /><br />Prior loreal no sulfite shampoo began acting weird.<br /><br />I've consistently used a chlorine filter in the shower and tub so not sure other than my hair texture has changed over time or the city water maybe.<br /><br />Seeing Drew Barrymore mention this shampoo gave it a try since we have similarly textured hair.<br /><br />It's amazing. My hair looks awesome. A huge relief from what the other stuff failed to do.<br /><br />Having the Whole Blends sulfite-free delivered on the sub and save in Honey Blend. Hoping it does as good a job.<br /><br />In regards to the shampoo bars, they make nice soap.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just as good as KONAD....or better", "text": "I got my nail plates and they are great. I have a few of the name brand Konad nail art plates and they are exactly the same, but better. They have more designs per plate and they have a lot of different designs to choose from. They work just as well as the Konad plates.<br /><br />I would suggest still using the Konad Special polish because like the Konad plates, a lot of regular store polishes don't work so well with the stamper. Metallic nail colors of any brand work well. Also, you can make your nail polish thicker by placing it in the fridge, so that will also help with getting the image to transfer.<br /><br />If you have wide nail beds you'll have to improvise on the full nail designs because they aren't as wide as the Konad plate versions. I only have issues with my thumb and i've fixed it by just putting polish on half the stamp and doing the part that isn't covered with the first stamp.<br /><br />Also, The edges of the plates are kind of sharp, but you could probably take a metal file or dremel and file around the disc's if it bothered you or you were concerned about it. They aren't too bad and since I just set mine on a paper towel I don't notice except when i'm putting it away.<br /><br />They all come with a protective wrapping on them so MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE IT before trying to stamp. it's plastic and i just used my nails to get it to come up off the plate for stamping.<br /><br />The price is amazing and the amount of stamp designs you get is awesome.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Comes with a wig cap and Bobby pins", "text": "I was really skeptical when I first purchased this because there is no reviews but since I received it I am really happy with the product! The hair is very thick and beautiful and shiny but not too shiny where it looks to fake but you can always spray some dry shampoo on it to help with that shininess. I was very surprised to receive the package and it came with the wig which is wrapped in a hairnet keep it from tingling in the box and also came with a package of bobby pins and a wig cap which I was worried I had a purchase in addition to this but I'm so glad that it came with it.<br /><br />The wig at edge of your hairline does look fake and it could be hard to work with but I think you could definitely wear it with a  baseball cap or a beanie over this week and it would look really cute which is how I plan on wearing it. I love the stone gray color it's not too light and silvery but it's a very nice toned down gray and it's so beautiful as you can see in the pictures it's very long .. comes down to about my mid back and it doesn't tangle that easily which is nice. It's very bouncy and I love it!!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Needs better instructions - doesn't have self timer! But does clean well", "text": "I've been using my Clarisonic on and off for the past few years and it's a pain to purchase the replacement brushes for that. It also kind of grosses me out that the bacteria can live in those bristles..the ones that are supposed to DEEP CLEAN you face! I've been wanting to try the Foreo Luna for a while but that costs $200!  this item looks almost identical to that Luna cleansing brush. My friend uses her Luna and swears by it now. I compared hers to this one and i think the shape of this facial brush is a lot more practical since it comes to that point at the top which is great around the eye, nose, mouth areas. However, looking at the Luna bristles and the bristles on this unit you can tell the Luna has their bristles closer and also has a great variety of  brush levels which their claim is to more efficiently cleanse the skin meeting the specific needs of different facial areas... compared to the Sytles II, this unit only has 2 types of bristles.  The Luna says it cleanses with 8,000 pulsations per minute, but this unit says it can &#34;reach 32,000 times per minute massage design if high frequency vibration&#34; ...which i'm not sure how true that is..and what that even means.... what is 32,000 times? What is it referring to?...this leads me to my other gripe with this product...........the instructions!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I wish this unit had BETTER INSTRUCTIONS...I was reading it and i'm so confused - it doesn't say how many modes it has and what each mode is used for..but it mentions &#34;modes&#34; have eight gears?<br /><br />Here's the &#34;operation&#34; instructions..please try to decipher what it means... and yes i know there's typos..but that is how it READS on the instruction manual...&#34;each mode has eight gear, may adjust the intensity according to your needed. According to the intermediate key open product cleaning mode for the first tiem. According to the second closed products the intensity of each mode can be though the + and - buttons to increase&#34;............excuse me what? anyway ...<br /><br />Here are my instructions!!!<br />1.) Charge the unit to full before first use. Flashing means it's charging and when it stops blinking it is fully charged.<br /><br />2.) Wet the unit and your face, apply some face wash and turn the unit on to cleanse your whole face for 2 minutes. This unit has 2 modes, cleanse and massage. When you press on the button between the - and + you have it on cleanse mode (the faster vibration) and you can adjust the vibration intensity higher or lower depending on what you prefer. When you press the middle button again it turns off ..when you press it one more time it will turn onto the massage mode (slower vibration) you can adjust the speed of vibration in this mode as well.<br />  -The unit does NOT have a self timer so don't expect this unit to shut off after 2 minutes of cleaning. It also says it has &#34;acoustic cleaning&#34; which i thought meant it would beep every 30 seconds indicating you should move to another part of your face (ex. left cheek, right cheek, chin and then forehead - like the clarisonic does) but does NOT so you need to keep track of how long you want to wash your face for with this.<br /><br />3) Shut the unit off when you're finished by clicking the middle button between the - and +. Pat the unit dry or leave it where it can air dry.<br /><br />One thing i like about this type of facial brush is that you don't need to replace any brush heads on this unit - it makes for more hygienic. This Styles II facial brush also claims to reverse signs of aging and restoring youth in your skin. I'm only 27 so i can't really speak to this claim, i don't have may wrinkles but i hope this is a great start for preventative measures.<br /><br />This unit also claims to be a durable travel sized facial brush - it feels very light weight which i like because i don't want a bulky unit, i really like that the cord is very small and doesn't need a stand charging unit like the clarisonic. I haven't used this enough to know how long one charge can hold but I'll let you know once i continue to use this consistently. Be sure to read the instructions because it says you NEED to charge the unit fully before your first use. When you plug it in you will see the light at the bottom to start flashing indicating that it is actively charging. I hope this unit will last forever as it claims - wouldn't that be AMAZING! :)<br /><br />I've already used this unit last night and i can say that my face felt very smooth and clean afterwards. I think it really preps the skin well for your serums and treatments at night, which is KEY for those products to work. If you don't exfoliate and clean your skin - it won't allow your products to actively work!<br /><br />I'm really excited for the 100% money back guarantee! I've only had this unit for one night so I don't know how i like it yet for the long term but I'm glad that this warranty is here in case it doesn't work well for my skin or if it breaks....<br /><br />Pros:<br />\u2022 Compact and easy to travel with<br />\u2022 Cute color!<br />\u2022 Comes with a charging cable ...which it came with a case too.<br />\u2022 Waterproof so you can use it in the shower<br />\u2022 Rechargeable - you can see the image where I'm charging the unit and the light is blinking. Once it stops blinking i'm assuming that is when it's fully charged.<br /><br />Cons:<br />\u2022 The plug for the adapter to connect seems like it could rip over time - you can see it in the picture, it's very flimsy...<br />\u2022 The user manual has very odd grammar and is hard to understand which side is for &#34;massaging&#34; and which side if for &#34;cleansing&#34;.  PLEASE edit your instructions so we all understand how to properly use it.<br />\u2022 Does NOT have a self timer and it does NOT beep to indicate when to move to another part of your face like the clarisonic or Luna do.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review. I love face products and purchasing things on Amazon so this is truly my honest review.  I think this is worth the $40 price tag for what it does. All in all - the Styles II facial brush does clean the face well, the vibrations are something to get used to.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XQds+kAhL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XQds+kAhL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XQds+kAhL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41keWE74fwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41keWE74fwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41keWE74fwL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518LxtDMIEL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518LxtDMIEL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518LxtDMIEL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L4kAk7nJL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L4kAk7nJL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L4kAk7nJL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NtONMm4dL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NtONMm4dL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NtONMm4dL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jYrBC9ZkL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jYrBC9ZkL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jYrBC9ZkL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ncZZRFPfL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ncZZRFPfL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ncZZRFPfL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSb0Pug2L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSb0Pug2L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSb0Pug2L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51slfXj8nlL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51slfXj8nlL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51slfXj8nlL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01AU4Z2TE", "parent_asin": "B01AU4Z2TE", "user_id": "AELHX3SODSPSMM7JIYVN24WKXRUA", "timestamp": 1455140242000, "helpful_vote": 27, "verified_purchase": false}

I received the holographic powder this afternoon and just finished my nails about 5 minutes ago. This is NOT a nail dip powder like Revel. The tiny small jar will probably do at least 100 nails based on the amount I just used for 10 fingers . Steps- You do your gel nails exactly like you always do them, and after your topcoat is cured, you take the eyeshadow applicator, barely dip it into the powder, and buff it over your nail like you are putting on eyeshadow but rub it in really well like blending. You do NOT dip your finger into the powder. You do NOT put it on your wet nail You put It on the dry topcoat, and buff it in, wipe off the excess with a dry brush or a cotton ball, then do another topcoat and cure that. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I am not sure how it will wear. I will update my review later. Please look at the online directions for this and don\u2019t be stupid! I used several different colors of polish to test it out, and it even works over just the clear.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "High Molecular Weight is the Real King!", "text": "I had been using High Molecular Weight HA for a couple of weeks on my face/ hair with nice moisturizing results. But at some point I read on beauty blogs and publications that since Low Molecular Weight HA is better absorbed through the skin, that it was a much better option for the face. Made sense to me. Because of this I bought a LMW HA serum to put on my skin. This serum felt differently, watery yet more drying that the HMW HA (HMW can initially feel a bit drying on the skin). My face also felt irritated ( I have acne-prone skin) after the first days of using it. I still decided to buy this powder and the results very similar to the serum I bought.<br /><br />So I decided to do some research on the difference between both, the HMW and the LMW, because I could not understand why the LMW, which is supposed to be a far better option for the skin (according to the beauty industry) , did not give me the good results I have with the HMW. Interestingly enough I found this: &#34;Transepidermal water loss increased by 55.5% with low-molecular weight , and was reduced by 28% with crosslinked resilient , and by 16% with HMW&#34;. So more water loss with LMW? Not good.<br /><br />I also noted this: &#34;There is abundant experimental evidence from the human physiology and biochemistry literature to support the basic notion that LMW-HA is inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and associated with adult scarring phenotypes rather than fetus-like, scar-free, truly regenerative healing.  The latter is what we want in an any aesthetic procedure, or topical adjunct to a procedure, or just for topical use.&#34; This part here may explain why my face felt irritated and even got a mild breakout after using the LMW HA. More info on this on Barefacedtruth. They have detailed explanation and comments on this.<br /><br />I did give this product a 3-star because it is nicely packaged, has the detailed info on the product, etc. 2 stars down for being marketed as a potent moisturizer.", "images": [], "asin": "B00JG8DY0A", "parent_asin": "B00JG8DY0A", "user_id": "AFEOQZ7V5WXEKIIPXME6XNLQQIUQ", "timestamp": 1487728133000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": true}

I assumed it's because it is a cheap product.  I also noticed that in the serum, I had white clumps which I assumed was due to the freezing temperatures outside at the time.  I also noticed this product had a very astringent smell -- similar to alcohol.<br /><br />Usage:<br />I had been using it twice daily after cleansing, toning, and my essence.  I am used to using a serum, but this product seriously made my face super red every time I applied it.  I assumed it was due to a niacin conversion on my skin, but after a couple weeks, I started breaking out more than ever.  I noticed that my skin was completely sensitive, red, and everything would sting my face.  I did not think it was this product at first, but after i stopped using this product completely, the redness and sensitivity stopped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Do not buy this product.  In my case, this product made my skin worse than it has ever been along with being super crazy sensitive.  I do not recommend this to anyone, but perhaps I received a bad batch?  The lot/manufacturing stamp on the product is \"8LB\" if anyone with the same lot/manufacturing stamp is having a similar issue...<br />However, if you are looking for a niacinamide+zinc formula, I would recommend Revolution Skincare Niacinamide+Zinc from Ulta instead.

I put a thin line on first with no luck, so I put a thicker (much thicker) line on and waited a bit before putting my lashes on. I'm not sure if it is truly magnets that hold them in place or just the goo/glue substance of the liner? I will say that with magnets you feel a \"pull\" sensation where the magnets are drawn together, I never got that feeling with this liner so my guess is... it is more the goo of the liner that holds them on (still better than glue).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "THE Standard in premium shaving", "text": "I've tried at least a dozen shave soaps, maybe two dozen.  MWF is my go-to, standard. I leave it in a shave bowl in a drawer.  I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  Wet and repeat for more water if needed. Lather around your face further as needed.  I often do this, then take a shower and repeat the lathering when I get out of the shower, and then shave.<br /><br />I have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don't care that much about fragrance.  MWF doesn't have much of any fragrance.  In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  If you like the smell of MWF (or any other shave soap), keep it in a covered container between uses.  I'd suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered and you'll have a $40 artisanal shave soap!<br /><br />I like the ingredients.  It's tallow based which I prefer.  There's lanolin in it which I like.  Although it's not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn't seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  It doesn't have shea butter in it, so I sometimes keep an open puck of shea butter shave soap in a shave dish next to MWF and occasionally reach down with my brush and lather from both.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews that say that it doesn't lather all that well in &#34;hard&#34; water.  We have moderately hard water in my city and I've never had trouble at all.<br /><br />Finally, it's cheap!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Plenty of foot spas on Amazon...hard to choose, but I chose wisely.", "text": "It took me over 2 weeks to finalize my purchase of a foot spa from Amazon.  There are so many foot spas and tons of reviews for them all, but we're all looking for the best value here.  I finally pulled the trigger and purchased this model.  Our previous foot spa was purchased from Walmart and had a heater, massage rollers (manual rollers) and bubbles, roughly costing around $60.  So my budget for the next spa would be under $100.  Today was my first day using it (1.5 hour usage:)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Heater:  Works like a champ!  I put relatively hot water into the basin to begin with (Onboard thermometer read 101 degrees.)  I then increased that heat to 105 and it maintained that temp throughout the duration of my use...only slight temp changes to 106 every once in a while, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Shower / Waterfall:  I didn't think anything of this when purchasing it, as I felt it was a gimmick.  It's actually quite soothing and has a purpose here....I used it for probably 75% of the time.<br /><br />Automatic massage rollers:  Holy cow...they are strong, but feel absolutely amazing.  There are 6 separate massage rollers that have several white balls on each that do all the massaging.  The rollers are powered by a motor at the bottom of the unit with the drive shaft come directly up, center of the basin, which is a square shaped metal rod that fits into the bottom of the massage roller plate (which can be removed easily.)<br /><br />Deep basin:  I'm 6'3\", 200 lbs...water completely submerges my feet and ankles and as plenty of room to move my foot back and forth or side to side.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Handle:  There is a handle that folds flush with the unit, but beware....each side of the handle is connected to the basin with 2 small metal screws.  The entire handle and what it's connected to is plastic and doesnt feel secure when the basin is filled with water.  But there is plenty of surface area on the bottom of the unit to easily get ahold of it while moving and the wheels are big enough to set the unit on the floor without squishing your fingers in the process.<br /><br />Bubbles:  Not a con for me, but my wife likes bubbles...So I guess it could be considered a con?

I have very little time to get ready in the morning before heading out to work, so I bought this brush to try it, since I am always looking for a solution. Now the verdict:<br /><br />It works well as long as you are not looking for a fast miracle. It heats up quickly and and goes through your hair like a regular brush. It dies tame unruly hair and gave me a flatish look very quickly, I went through my entire hair in less than four minutes and my back of the head volume went down and the sponge &#34;pyramid&#34; went down. I ended my few minutes long styling with balm and there! I looked human again and it lasted all day. My hair feels silkier and definitely looks like I spent more time styling it, but not salon styled of course. It suits my needs so I am keeping it. I would say it gives 68 percent flat hair, which is a good result considering the time invested, If you want to look like Hollywood star or the girl in the advertisement of the product, this is not for you, and you will need to go to 30 minutes blow dry and 30'minutes flat ironing if you want flat straight perfect results.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Attractive packaging<br />-It works if you have reasonable expectations<br />- Fast fair to good results<br /><br />Cons<br />- Product looks cheap and chintzy<br />- The brush's bristles are made out of very hard plastic, ouch!<br />- No glove included, although the handle doesn't get hot<br /><br />I am satisfied with the results. Now I can go to work without looking like a mop everyday.

The one disadvantage to it is that the sides of the brush get hot and burned my ear as I was brushing down my hair, like I would use a normal brush.<br />Overall it is a great product and you can use it as a normal brush when it is not on!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419cAKip04L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419cAKip04L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419cAKip04L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zJc3hehYL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zJc3hehYL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zJc3hehYL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01C2R0A5S", "parent_asin": "B01C2R0A5S", "user_id": "AG6LU4AY4ZMVLLSJN4JI2ZZPCMIQ", "timestamp": 1460569971000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

The adapter isn\u2019t included but I use my phones charging adapter and it works fine), 1 Pink Nail File with strong grit on both sides of the file and a blue buffer on one side and then a white side on the back that I use to make my real nails shiny) and last but not least a small storage container with secure clasps and a handle for safe storage as well as a instruction booklet.<br /><br />THIS KIT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RUBBING ALCOHOL YOU MUST HAVE WHEN DOING THESE TYPE OF NAILS!

I definitely suggest buying one that is more heavy duty and has higher wattage (you can always use it on gel nails or on regular polish to cut drying time in half) and #2 The nail color doesn\u2019t have any way of telling which bottle is what color. I just took a dot tool and dipped it in the color and put a dot on the middle of the top of the poly gel nail polish cap (there\u2019s a indented circle that it fits perfectly on) but it\u2019s hard to see the darker blue when doing this but you\u2019ll know what that color is by process of elimination \ud83d\ude09", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tewZrYwvL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tewZrYwvL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tewZrYwvL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ttTlMpCDL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ttTlMpCDL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ttTlMpCDL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHG9yBXML._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHG9yBXML._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHG9yBXML.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cZ8scJcxL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cZ8scJcxL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cZ8scJcxL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jKBRqswqL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jKBRqswqL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jKBRqswqL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l+XUvWlkL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l+XUvWlkL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l+XUvWlkL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B087GB8ZRF", "parent_asin": "B087GB8ZRF", "user_id": "AHLA24J43UD2AKTINUBUWKEDPQHQ", "timestamp": 1596444080841, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Cheap, but Cheaply Made.", "text": "I've had these for almost a year but I haven't used them that much--there are a select few designs that I use regularly, but the majority have remained untouched. Here's why:<br />-A lot of my plates came damaged; maybe I'm just the unlucky one in a thousand, but many had imperfections in the metal that ruined the images. Other than that, the undamaged plates worked decently. You might run the risk of having damaged plates like me, but I'm guessing this was just my bad luck. Can't really blame the company since I never made the effort to return them, and it's been waaay past 30 days (at the time I was just happy I got them).<br />-I liked that there were themed and matching stamps, but to be honest I just don't like a lot of the images enough to actually use them. There is an unnecessary amount of tribal/swirly images, and what were they thinking with the ambiguous pair of chili peppers? Take a good look at the individual images and take that into account more than the sheer number of plates. Will you actually use them?<br />-Unless you have child's hands, the full-nail plates are waay too small--it's most noticeable on the thumbs and middle fingers, but they can barely fit over any of my nails (in terms of width, not length--I don't have crazy-long nails). To avoid awkward-looking nails, I haven't used many of the full nail stamps. Images like the polka-dots are easy to align and restamp, but others not so much.<br />-They come off a little blurrier than Konads, but nothing too horrible<br />-Some of the images are nice in theory, but don't show up that well once stamped. For example, there's a cute lace french tip that I just couldn't get to work because it was impossible to pick up the full image.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />-they're cheap, and most of the images are pretty crisp<br />-A lot of the full-nail designs have matching french tips<br />-The french tips will definitely (probably) fit over all your nails, including thumbs.<br />-I like the themed plates--for example, there's a Christmas one and a Halloween one.<br />-I've heard complaints that these plates were too sharp, but I don't see how you could accidentally hurt yourself with them--maybe they've updated their plate design?<br /><br />Although I haven't used many of the images, those I do use make the bundle worth it.

It has a light clean fragrance, but does not at all smell like black tea, as I had hoped it would. The consistency is gel like, but a lot stickier than I would prefer. It definitely leaves a tacky feel on my skin. Luckily, it absorbs well overnight and does not leave a mess on my pillow. My skin does look and feel moisturized and soothed in the morning. There are definitely sleeping packs I prefer, such as the Erno Laszlo Hydra-Therapy Memory Sleep Mask. Of course, this product is nearly 9 times less expensive than the Laszlo for 3 times the product. With most skin care, I find you get what you pay for, so this isn't at all surprising. I'm unlikely to purchase this again, though I will certainly use up what I have. It really isn't bad for the price.", "images": [], "asin": "B01E54U1U0", "parent_asin": "B01E54U1U0", "user_id": "AGHDW54T532AR4LUK6I4U674SX3Q", "timestamp": 1497325167637, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Kiss has the best nails! Instructions on how to make them last 10-14 days!", "text": "These nails are GORGEOUS!!<br /><br />Do NOT use the sticky adhesive as they make the nails not last as long. Simply:<br />1. Push your cuticles back<br />2. File down your nails<br />3. Lightly file your nail bed so the glue has something a little rough to hang to, it\u2019s always easier than putting glue and a nail on a smooth surface and makes them last much longer<br />4. Find the 10 nails that fit you and lay them down in the order of the fingers you will put them own (pink-ring-middle-index-thumb-thumb-index-middle-ring-pinky) - they have numbers on the underneath of the nail on the tip, remember those numbers or write them down because that\u2019s likely your size in all Kiss nails (for example, I\u2019m 12-10-7-8-3-3-8-7-10-12, the smaller the number the bigger the mail)<br />5. When you\u2019re ready to apply, place glue on the bottom of the fake nail about 1/6 inch from the bottom to the middle of the nail and make sure it\u2019s dispersed even - DO NOT put the glue directly on the nail bed, for longevity it works best to put it on the fake nail<br />6. Align with the appropriate finger and place down, holding for 5-10 seconds.<br />7. There may be a little glue that comes out on the sides. Be careful not to smudge that on the nail itself. Just take a paper towel and dab that little bit of glue up as you go<br />8. Once all nails are on, file how you need/want them and you are set for about 10 days.<br />9. I usually get a solid 2 weeks of wear out of mine! I use either these KGN10, the almond shaped wine, or I\u2019ll do a French or natural French short length from Kiss.<br />10. Carry around an extra nail or two that may fit a couple different fingers for emergencies, the glue, and the nail file. If a nail pops off and it\u2019s not a broken nail, simply file your nail bed again and apply glue to either a new nail that fits, or the one you popped off if it\u2019s salvageable.<br /><br />Enjoy!", "images": [], "asin": "B081V4JG57", "parent_asin": "B081V4JG57", "user_id": "AH3GGLYG3OBEBIO3KMRPYW5D2LEA", "timestamp": 1614847738880, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Move Over Palisade!!! Save Money & Time!", "text": "I continue to be sort of amazed at all the cool nail art supplies that keep coming out!! Born Pretty is my favorite Nail Art Brand. I have several Born Pretty items already, and my collection continues to grow! I am so very glad that I found this product!! The set includes 26 different pieces of Nail Shields, that come in 10 different sizes, to shield the skin around your nails and cuticles from nail polish. With all the different sizes included, it is very easy to find the right sizes to fit each of your fingers (my right hand is slightly larger than my left hand, & most people are the same, with one side being just a tiny bit bigger than the opposite side). There is nothing complicated about these at all, you simply slip on each Nail Shield like a ring at the top of your finger tips. Each Nail Shield fits each finger fully and comfortably. The right fit will cover the skin around the nails snugly but also comfortably. After you have found your proper sizes, you can apply your nail polish neatly and precisely, without getting nail polish stains on your skin to clean up after!<br /><br />The directions say to wear the Nail Shields right-side-up, as shown in the pictures (with the curve facing up). This does a fabulous job at shielding the skin around the nail from polish. I find that it also works nicely if you turn them upside-down (with the curve facing down, going from cuticle from nail tip, like the letter U) and then they shield not only the skin around the nail, but the cuticle too!! I still have to make an effort to leave a little space between the cuticle and where the nail polish starts (should be slightly above the cuticle), so using the Nail Shields &#34;upside-down/letter U&#34; also makes a stencil which forces the little gap between cuticle and where polish begins, for a clean, precise, and professional look. (PLEASE SEE MY ATTACHED PHOTOS FOR REFERENCE!)<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, this latest neat and super handy innovation from Born Pretty is also Eco Friendly and Money Saving ++$$!! I have been buying bottles of Liquid Palisade to do the same job, whereas Born Pretty's Nail Shields can be re-used again and again. Palisade can get expensive...  Palisade can also be a real pain to get off, depending on the quality (some are thin in texture and don't come off easily or in one piece). Using tape is even more cumbersome, messy, and inacurate. I'm SO glad I found these!! I was also really fortunate to be able to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. It is a win/win situation, Born Pretty Is my favorite Nail Art Company because I love every item I have ever purchased from them! These Nail Guards will save me a bunch of money over time, and not just from having to purchase more palisade. They are practical, they work well, and I am really happy with my results! They save money, they save time, they are easy to clean up, and they last for countless uses!  You really can't go wrong with these :D", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DPeOjXJ1L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DPeOjXJ1L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DPeOjXJ1L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcMDSXpiL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcMDSXpiL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcMDSXpiL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egYVC3+bL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egYVC3+bL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egYVC3+bL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v9GQ8H0aL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v9GQ8H0aL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v9GQ8H0aL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01D8C3MCE", "parent_asin": "B01D8C3MCE", "user_id": "AHWPTGX6OD4D46LCQTQVRY4PPHTA", "timestamp": 1468310236000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "5 Drops Will Do Ya", "text": "This is a very nice hair serum that is targeted at encouraging and speeding up hair growth. The first ingredent, and therefore the  most prevalent ingredient, is a type of silicone. Silicone has become the most popular ingredient for anti-friz and shine serums for hair, not to mention a whole world of cosmetics like oil free moisturizers and foundations. It has a slip to it, which gives silicone the *feeling of being like an oil, but it is by its nature, is totally oil free. And of course, also by its nature, it cannot clog pores or follicles. Infact, the Dae Long Hair Growth Serum formula contains three different types of silicone as its first three ingredients. The active ingredients in the product, or the ingredients that actually enable the product to do its job of encouraging hair growth, are Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Lupine Protein, and Panax Ginseng. These nourish and stimulate the hair follicles to remain longer in the anagen, or hair growing phase, and to produce healthier, stronger hair from the root. Jojoba oil is a skin compatible oil, meaning that it cannot and does not clog pores or follicles, closely resembles the body's own natural lubrication, and can be absorbed by human hair, skin, and nails. There is also extract of Macadamia Nut Oil, which moisturizes the hair cuticle and shaft and helps to prevent hair breakage and split ends. Hydrolyzed protein from the seeds of the lupine plant are very high in protein and contain 35-45% of all the essential amino acids. Panax ginseng is an extract from the panax ginger root and has nourishing and stimulating qualities that directly feed and nourish the hair follicle. I was fortunate to be able to order this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have used a great many hair serums and products to stimulate growth of stronger, longer, and healthier hair. One of my favorite things about this Dae Long Hair Growth Serum is that it has a very pleasant fragrance! I also really like that the ingredient list is simple, straightforward, and does not contain weird chemicals or scary preservatives!!! It has a very clean  feel to it, not leaving your hair greasy at the last part that you want to be greasy, the roots. A few drops goes a long way I say five drops will do. While pleasant, It is also important not to over do it!. I have very, very sensitive skin and had no problem at all with this. Time will tell how much it makes the hair grow. I am also taking a good hair, skin & nails vitamin because as a Licensed Esthetician, I know for a fact that you have to feed and nourish INSIDE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE in order to truly grow longer, stronger, and healthier hair!!", "images": [], "asin": "B01EST7TBQ", "parent_asin": "B01EST7TBQ", "user_id": "AHWPTGX6OD4D46LCQTQVRY4PPHTA", "timestamp": 1467713711000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.<br /><br />I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.<br /><br />And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!<br /><br />This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out.

This facial cleansing pad is a new one to my skincare arsenal. It seems to be a take on various Korean modes of skin cleansing that are currently popular.<br /><br />First off, let me say this sponge is very soft, much softer than anything I've ever used for exfoliating on my face. But while it's soft, it does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without stripping your skin raw. The outer surface feels almost silky, but when you put your fingers in and slightly stretch it to keep it on for use, the stretching opens up the cells in the surface and reveals a very effective, yet gentle, exfoliating mechanism.<br /><br />It's very easy to use, and very easy to clean - it comes with a silken loop to hang it for drying (it dries quickly.) All in all, I like this a lot. It's a nice change from daily Clarisonic use, one my skin truly appreciates.

Very soft and dense, and a miracle for something that's less than six bucks. My contouring skills are such that I know not to buy an entire palette of colors that are way too orangey or warm. I use Kevyn Aucoin's contour powder which is way pricey (you can find something similar in color in Makeup Forever's eyeshadow line), but the Aucoin contour powder color was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />As I'm sure you know, contour is meant to mimic a shadow. It is NOT a bronzer (you cannot contour with anything with the slightest bit of shine); too orange and you look ridiculous. The color is a light matte taupe with zero hint of red in it. It should NOT be too dark, unless you are dark complected. Think of it as being two shades darker than your skin color, the way a shadow is cast on the hollows or low areas of your face.<br /><br />This brush picked up the powder like a champ and deposited it nicely. Does a great job fading the contour color out so it looks like a shadow and not like I have a swath of dirt on my face. My only hesitation with this so far is that I wish it was angled, but no matter. It's not that hard to use in such a way (well, what do you want for less than six bucks?)<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this. You won't get anything better at anywhere near the price.", "images": [], "asin": "B00WQEJV6M", "parent_asin": "B00WQEJV6M", "user_id": "AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA", "timestamp": 1442722144000, "helpful_vote": 35, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Pure retro red", "text": "When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.<br /><br />Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.<br /><br />My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.<br /><br />The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)<br /><br />The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.<br /><br />This container isn't.<br /><br />So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.<br /><br />I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)<br /><br />The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.<br /><br />The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.<br /><br />I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.<br /><br />The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.<br /><br />The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.<br /><br />If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.<br /><br />N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)", "images": [], "asin": "B005AQC9U8", "parent_asin": "B005AQC9U8", "user_id": "AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA", "timestamp": 1380817768000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (\u201cTEA\u201d) high on the ingredient list. It\u2019s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it\u2019s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I\u2019m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I\u2019m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I\u2019m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don\u2019t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it\u2019s a common ingredient I don\u2019t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.", "images": [], "asin": "B09X23VTSQ", "parent_asin": "B09X23VTSQ", "user_id": "AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA", "timestamp": 1669914635772, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I\u2019d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup.

I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can\u2019t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira\u2018s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira\u2019s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I\u2019ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira\u2019s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven\u2019t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I\u2019m cautious about the eye area, so I\u2019m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet.

The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I\u2019ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I\u2019ll need to work up.

These don\u2019t irritate my dry and sensitive skin and seem well suited to any skin types.<br /><br />I\u2019ve used 20% L-Ascorbic acid for many years and worked up from 5% to 20% over time as it can sting, itch or irritate the skin to go straight to a high 20% concentration. I\u2019ve been using this Universal C Serum since last year (before this sample kit) and had no stinging this time and had only temporary, slight stinging when I first tried the C serum last year as I wasn\u2019t using my Vitamin C serum as routinely for a short period.<br /><br />With regular use at least 1x a day, the Universal C Serum brightens my skin and evens my skin tone. While it didn\u2019t go away 100%, this serum flattened and faded a large brown spot on my jawline so much it became barely visible. It also faded smaller brown spots on my cheeks. The serum makes my skin smoother and it seems a bit firmer. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant for long term anti aging benefits too.<br /><br />I apply the Universal C Serum after cleansing and toning and follow with the Essence (Squalene drops) and Moisture Boost. The Moisture Boost feels lightweight and nongreasy, but it\u2019s super moisturizing when I mix in a couple Squalane drops. The texture of my dry skin feels so silky and smooth, and my skin feels comfortable and amply hydrated all day. These products provide real benefits for me.

Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I\u2019ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn\u2019t in the short time I\u2019ve left it on).

I used Glo Pro regularly for about 2-1/2 months, 2-3 times a week. I\u2019m 57 and felt my skin did look particularly good with regular use. While results weren\u2019t dramatic in that my wrinkles didn\u2019t magically disappear, I feel the overall appearance of my skin seemed brighter, firmer and some lines seemed less noticeable. Around my eyes and cheeks aren\u2019t big problem areas (except dark circles), but my fine lines looked virtually nonexistent in those areas and I feel I looked more refreshed and my skin looked more taut. The frown lines by my mouth are my worst issue and those didn\u2019t improve as much as I hoped, but I did think the lines seemed less noticeable and the area seemed less saggy or firmer to me.<br /><br />I decided to take a break of about a month to see if I stopped if I\u2019d notice a difference.  I don\u2019t think my skin looks as good as it did when using Glo Pro regularly. I feel I look less refreshed, my frown lines look worse and my skin seems kind of dull. I can\u2019t speak to the science of whether micro needing really increases collagen production (or if it can damage the skin), or if my benefit is because it increases absorption of my arsenal of serums and creams. But I do think I looked better from use and my skin doesn\u2019t look as good since I stopped. It\u2019s a tool that I\u2019ve gone back to using, and I do really like using a lot.  I apply quality serums and creams within 60 seconds of using Glo Pro and do think I get bigger benefits from my products. I personally avoid using AHA and retinol products after Glo Pro as they\u2019re too irritating for my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I don\u2019t find Glo Pro painful to use.

I only use Glo Pro at night and never wake with any redness or irritation.

I definitely prefer using this slimmer eye head for the delicate area around my eyes and between my brows and even my forehead (which is small). The smaller head gives me better control and greater ease of using Glo Pro in small areas.<br /><br />I wasn\u2019t sure of the boundaries around my eye area, so I emailed Glo Pro and was informed the eye head can be used right up to the bottom lashes (but not on the eye lids).

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "OK, but outperformed by a $10 foil electric", "text": "I got this shaver in early January of 2007.  For the first month or so that I had it, it worked decently.  The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).<br /><br />Over the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more 'pulling' instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn't as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn't holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be 'full power' for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was 'expected' for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).<br /><br />I kept using the razor as I wasn't about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.<br /><br />In short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn't a good value for the investment.", "images": [], "asin": "B0009MFUOA", "parent_asin": "B0009MFUOA", "user_id": "AERG2TRTS4IWR6IBVODWM26W2LYQ", "timestamp": 1214938909000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Truly devious packaging", "text": "I bought this from Target because I'd had a fairly good experience with their deodorant. The shampoo itself is OK, but the bottle it's packaged in is designed to keep you from actually getting what you paid for. I'll explain.<br /><br />The curved shape of the bottle itself probably makes it very efficient to pack/ship, but it also makes it difficult to squeeze, especially in combination with the thick, rigid plastic they use. And because the \"nozzle\" (or whatever it's called) is offset rather than centered, you cannot balance it upside-down to make it easier to get the remaining shampoo out as the bottle gets low. The combination of these three factors (rigid plastic, thin curved shape, and offset \"nozzle\") means that at a certain point, you're going to have shampoo left in the bottle that you can't actually get out, unless you want to rig some kind of device to balance the bottle upside-down.<br /><br />This may seem like a minor complaint, but with basically ANY other brand of shampoo (or body wash, EMJ does this with those as well), you don't have to deal with this. It's wasteful, and it feels like it was probably designed that way on purpose, to get consumers to buy the next bottle faster. Given that the shampoo and body wash (which I also tried) isn't anything particularly special, I can't recommend anyone bother with this.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Pretty nice quality hair for the price.", "text": "I've been using extensions since 2006, due to health issues causing extreme hair thinning.  I used to get the fused extensions at the salon, 1500 dollars back in the day. They broke off from the weight of the extensions because my hair was so fine and thin. The fused glob of hair was just too much and so many fell out. I started buying the clip in hair, taking the clips off and using them as weft hair. I use salon pro white glue, much like eyelash glue but used for weft hair.  It is a wonderful solution and I still alternate between tape in hair and the clip in wefts. I also buy closures and custom color, to make my own toppers. What a job! But, I'm happy with the results. I have more control over the color and style, and I feel 'normal'.<br /><br />This hair is a medium to coarse texture, thick, and has a really nice body wave. The  is soft and smooth and doesn't feel damaged.  It will blend with fine hair. You can use a straightening iron, just be sure that you can control the temperature. Once you burn this hair, it will stink and it will be ruined. However, if you control the temperature and use care, the hair looks great straight and shiny. You can also curl the hair. I have used felted hot rollers, and those work really well. They are safer, and not as damaging, and the curls last so long.<br /><br />These 16\" extensions are very nice. Although the ad isn't quite accurate. The color is a darker caramel blond, and a reddish brown. This is not piano keys, but close. The wefts are not in the ombre style, they are bold and varied high lights. If you look at the ad images, the photos showing the people aren't shown with this product in their hair. The wefts laying on a surface showing the color differences between the offered colors is the most accurate.  I've offered some images that show the color more accurately.  You can custom color most of the wefted hair, but adding color is easier. Typically the hair has so much red in it that it is impossible to cover or remove, and the dye can be hard to remove. You can add a longer root to eliminate the chunky roots.  My hair is so fine, the sewn edge can be obvious, so have a good match to my natural blonde ash tone roots helps. Any coloring will add to the damage and potentially shorten the life of the hair, but for me it makes me happier to have an exact match to what I want, and I am hard to match for color.<br /><br />The weight of the hair is shown in a photo in ounces. In grams, we get a little over 104 grams, far less than the advertised 120grams, and I would complain about this and have, just not for this brand.  That being said, the fullness and the weight is still good, and the wefts seem to feel average when compared to what I usually order. If you order the longer options, the hair will be thinner, as most hair is sold by weight. 120 would be better, of course. This weight is significantly lower than 120grams.<br /><br />Shedding.  Over the last 7 years or so, shedding has become a real problem. It never used to be this bad. There is a weft glue that is meant to slow or prevent shedding and I always use it. It makes the weft more stiff, but if you use the weft the way I use them, you need to do something to protect your weft hair.  You can find it online. If you are using this hair for special occasions and clipping  to thick strong hair and are simply making your hair more full, wild and glamorous, then you may not need to worry about shedding. I did finger comb this hair once out of the packaging, and there was significant shedding. Again, I say, this is a common issue now, and unique to this particular brand. I have no idea what changed but the wefts should not shed this much, but they all do this with most brands.  I have to say that if the wefts didn't shed so much, they would last for a couple of years or longer.  Also, keep in mind I use the wefts differently, so clipping, as intended, may offer longer life and far less shedding.<br /><br />The length is 16\" and the hair hangs nicely, with a gentle, natural taper.  There is a very nice body wave. It's not a blunt edge finish, which is nice.<br /><br />The clips are the same type that I see on most clip in kits. They are small, and hold nicely even on fine hair.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great value and will require the extra effort to keep them looking great over a year or more.  To keep human hair looking good and tangle free, I use the sleep and shine shampoo and conditioner. It keeps the hair fresher and mat free longer.  There are a lot  of youtube videos that can help you with application and care, and give you tips and tricks.<br /><br />4 stars.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EEyjKTZTL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EEyjKTZTL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EEyjKTZTL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yiBWglRtL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yiBWglRtL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yiBWglRtL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C2f0eFc0L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C2f0eFc0L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C2f0eFc0L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91U15Dmq3ZL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91U15Dmq3ZL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91U15Dmq3ZL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UnKbeqdWL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UnKbeqdWL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UnKbeqdWL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91W3L3Sn0WL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91W3L3Sn0WL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91W3L3Sn0WL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iJSmiPS+L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iJSmiPS+L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iJSmiPS+L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08R6QX4Y9", "parent_asin": "B08R6QX4Y9", "user_id": "AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ", "timestamp": 1618218516591, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This is a great product line.", "text": "This product is exactly as advertised and shown in the images. This mini system does not come with color, so be prepared.  The packaging is attractive, and the products came very well packaged and arrived safely in perfect condition.  This gel nail polish kit has  a little different texture than some of the kits available these days. This system has a complete nail prep and foundation product line-up much like the really great gel nails from 20 years ago. I'm hoping the long term quality of the nail growth and health with this product line,  is as good as the old products as well. As well all know, products can help your nails or destroy them, and this product line, the formulas remind me of the better products that were once available and were very expensive to buy.<br /><br />The thing people may not be used to is the last step of using the finishing wipe to remove the sticky layer once the manicure is complete. Some top coats are completely set and free of any tackiness right after the curing process. These products cure quickly with some heat, and 60 seconds seemed to be plenty of time. After the top coat and final removal of the tackiness, the nails are perfect. This kit doesn't come with color, so I experimented with a milky white and some blue ink, using the wood tools included in the kit to move and swirl the pigment around. It's a fun, creative way to change  up polish. I think stencils could be fun, and I do have mica powders, some bling pieces, to play with as well. I like these products, and the box came with a nice catalogue of other products available.<br /><br />This product is easy to use, I've experienced no irritation of my cuticles or nail bed, no itching or discomfort at all. The light is really cute, tiny and it works. Just one easy button and it turns off automatically in a minute. I pressed twice to get 2 minutes but found that 1 minute was enough, which is great.

When I order next I'll be ordering the shorter hair.  The weight of the hair for 20 pieces, is 50grams, so for each longer strand you have a finer tape in weft. With the shorter lengths you get a little more fullness in other words but typically the good brands still make sure they are clear about the weight of the hair you get in grams. My hair is so fine that one bundle of 20 nearly is enough, but I buy 2 sets and end up using 4 rows of about 6 extensions each then complete the look with a topper because my crown is so thin the extensions and scalp shows. I'll be toning these extensions but this is how they look as they came, with no color correction. B 8-18-60. Which is usually the color I order, but this is better.

You must seal the backside of the tape or the weft will fall out, or make a mess of your hair. Many people need 4 or more sets to do a full head of hair. Some people with thicker and stronger hair will use two full wefts back to back and will not need the single sided tape. There are you tube videos about DIY application of tape in extensions. There are many steps and I'm skipping most of it. It's not that hard and you'll enjoy the convenience and savings by doing this yourself. Your biggest challenge is finding good hair and good tapes. This time used Glam single sided tapes and that worked great. expensive but good and you get 36 in the package. I use walker double sided tapes, they come in packages of 120 and have worked for me but they are stiff. This brand has tapes, and I'll be checking out their tapes soon.  I will have to update to let you know how they last and how easy or difficult they are to remove. Typically my tape in hair lasts about 6 weeks and then due to growth there is a need to take them out and put them back in again, moving them up closer to the scalp. 6 to 8 weeks is typically when you go to the salon to get cut and root touch ups too. This isn't really about hold or the extensions coming out, although some may come out. This is about limiting damage to the hair and just keeping the connection point closer to the scalp. They feel good, the hair quality seems great. There is far less red in this hair than typical of the dark blonds or ash blond roots.  This color combination is good. The description says silky straight but I prefer some body wave, and as you can see when you wet this hair there is a little natural wave that comes out. That's perfect. I've offered plenty of photos. The kit that the hair came with is nice too. Some double sided tapes to refresh your weft after you clean them in 6 weeks or so.  To remove the wefts I typically just stick my finger nail between the two layers of tape and put a drop or two with a dropper of alcohol 91 percent will work but 99 is better. This usually works to safely loosen the glue bond and remove the hair. I tried the oil based removers and it just complicates things. The best removers are mostly alcohol. I'll update this review in 6 to 8 weeks. For now, I'd recommend these extension for the hair and weft quality and accuracy of color and weight.  Good value. 5 starts. I hope they keep this up.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Xw4beGKL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Xw4beGKL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Xw4beGKL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Di2vFB7BL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Di2vFB7BL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Di2vFB7BL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L+CoBE0kL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L+CoBE0kL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L+CoBE0kL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4jx3q8SL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4jx3q8SL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4jx3q8SL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WQh3HwKCL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WQh3HwKCL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WQh3HwKCL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZD6WmzffL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZD6WmzffL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZD6WmzffL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GIzQZmrVL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GIzQZmrVL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GIzQZmrVL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-Ec1nLzL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-Ec1nLzL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-Ec1nLzL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ux8mf0QbL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ux8mf0QbL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ux8mf0QbL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07SR1CBQ7", "parent_asin": "B07SR1CBQ7", "user_id": "AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ", "timestamp": 1581124805880, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not too convinced about claims after use for a few days.", "text": "Usually a serum is immediately effective at deep hydration, fine line and dryness management even if temporary. Usually the under eye area darkness, under eye wrinkles, puffiness, and crows feet are treated and diminished within minutes of first application and improves the look of make up in those areas as well. Perhaps over time the texture of the skin improves with continued use but can backslide if product use is discontinued.<br /><br /> I have not seen much improvement, immediate or over the few days with use twice daily while using this product, unfortunately. Also, I'm not sure when we are supposed to use this product. Perhaps over night? The reason why I mention this is that the product doesn't absorb into the skin cleanly, but rather is tacky to the touch and feels heavy. I didn't notice any fragrance, but I make candles and am probably nose blind at the moment. The product feels like a watery jelly, because it is mostly water and aloe gel.  It does have gold flecks in it and they seem to break up and disappear when on the skin, massaged. I haven't seen any help for fine lines or skin texture. This is a photo taken right now. Un-retouched The left side of the photo is the 24k serum side, after three days and after recent application. The right side is immediate results of another product I use applied within a half hour of the photo. It works so fast, even I couldn't believe the photo. The lines on the other side are pretty bad actually, which means I've back slid over the last few days and have more trouble. I've been using the 24K serum on half of my face, the right side of my face only. As to the right side of the photo and left side of my face, I'm not pulling on it or doing anything to make the skin look better, less wrinkled or tighter, I just put the serum on and wrote for a bit and then took the photo to complete this review. The right side serum is from a farmer's market made by a local person, Julia's. This roll on was only 15 dollars and I've been using it for under eye area on days when I wear makeup,  for a few months.  I felt I should offer a photo, although not a great photo and it's not flattering at all. I'll continue to try it, but at my age I need all the help I can get and don't want to backslide.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aAHcoBisL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aAHcoBisL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aAHcoBisL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07LGWMPL6", "parent_asin": "B07LGWMPL6", "user_id": "AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ", "timestamp": 1574645522368, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up.  Impossible to remove without damaging hair.

It has clips but they aren't for longer hair.  My best friend cuts his own hair but his is longer and he uses a kit that has more clip sizes with it.  If you are concerned you might not know how to use this well, get online and watch videos.  There are so many that will tell you exactly how to do it and how to use clippers.  If you keep your hair very short, this is good to use so you don't have to go back to the barber too quickly and can keep a big haircut at bay.  Look at the width of the head and make sure that suits you.  That was something I hadn't considered until I started using this.  I think it would be easier to maneuver for the beard if it were just a little narrower.  However, with the size it is you can cover more area much more quickly, with fewer passes.  It removes the hair very well with just one pass.  It doesn't come with oil but it is recommended you oil this as needed.  It comes with a cable for charging.  Because it is cordless, I can use it anywhere and that is very convenient.  The clips go one easy and can be a little harder to get off.

The beauty lays in the eye catching design and craftsmanship found in the shaver, the flaw--unfortunately--is in it's primary purpose, which is, as a shaver. As it turns out, I've owned two other Norelcos and a mid-range Braun which have proven to be dependable, well made and produce a good, clean shave. The Norelco arcitec 1050, while doing reasonably well at the job of cleaning the scruff off one's mug, seems to require more passes to do the same thing the older models managed with one. The trimmer is also different. The idea is that you must pop off the razor head to get use of it. A novel idea I suppose, but I cannot say that it is any better or worse than the trimmer on my old Norelcos, though it is narrower. Want to buy an Norelco arcitec? Then the 1050 is absolutely the model you should get as the much pricier 1090 is identical in every respect except that the LED array includes a battery charge countdown(which ironically draws power), providing you a ballpark idea of when you'll run out of juice. This shaver is still a little expensive (mine happened to be a gift), but it is well made and should provide years of service. I've had mine for over a year and the battery still holds a good charge lasting over a week of daily use.

Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fortunate Discovery", "text": "Purchased on a whim, to see if it would do what other products promised and didn't completely deliver.  It does deliver.  I have an old parquet floor that has aged and faded from before I bought my house.  Other products advertised themselves as restorers for this kind of problem.  They did after a fashion but still left the floor looking mostly the way it was before.  Given my experience with the other products, I didn't have great hopes for this product, but to my surprise, just one application of this beeswax product has pretty much done the trick.  The fading is pretty much gone and the wood has a warm, lustrous look now.  It also brought back the original finish on some items of furniture I tried it on, simply wiping it on the wood.  Instructions are minimal, so use caution with the sponge:  it absorbs the wax, so there is a reserve of wax inside it.  When I went to rinse off the dust from the sponge I squeezed it and wax came out with every squeeze.

I have other cheap hair brushes, and now I know what to look for in a hair brush. It is such a convenient size too. It can fit in my purse, my clutch purse even.<br /><br />This works great on my short hair, but if you have thick or very long hair, you might want to look for a bigger brush. It's great for a quick touch up, I think I'm going to keep it in my car, when I'm short on time and don't want to fumble through my purse, I'll have it handy in my side door pocket or glove compartment. This will even work on my baby grandson's hair. It is soft and gentle.<br /><br />This brush measures about 6&#34; in length. It is a perfect size to even carry in your pocket in you need to.<br />This is a really good company that will give you a 100% Money Back Guarantee! You really won't need to return it, if you know right off from the start that it is a small brush and that it works great for a quick touch up, children's hair, fine hair and I read from other reviews that it works great as a beard brush.<br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review of this boar bristle brush.

You should never, ever buy another razor but this, EVER!  Also, I thought it felt loose the first time, so the second time, I flipped the razor over inside the holder and that was just right!  So, if yours is not perfect the first time, it just means your blade is upside down!  But, this razor actually worked and still felt fabulous upside down!

Once you put the pans in place in the magnetic palette, don't move them or the glue will come unstuck. I did clean the bottoms of the pans first with alcohol but no luck.

I've had it flat ironed, barrel curl, wand curl, and spiral rod curls. This hair holds curls very well and after a few days, the curls open and fall so natural. After having it installed as a sew in for 2 weeks, I took it out and made a wig. This is much more conveinent for maintenance. Hair is still beautiful and going strong. I haven't experienced shedding because I did not cut the wefts, nor did I sew through them. This is the best hair I have received in comparison with expensive brands that I've used in the past. I also take good care of the hair and wrap it up at night when it is installed.<br />A bonus is receiving eyelashes, although I don't wear them.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I've never had bad skin before", "text": "I'm in my early 30s, and I've been breaking out with pimples on my face for the past few years. I've never had bad skin before, but I'm back in school and working full time, so maybe the stress is causing my breakouts. Anyway, I've tried SO MANY treatment options: salicylic acid products, benzoyl peroxide treatments, charcoal soap, sodium bentonite clay mask, oil facial wash, and finally a prescription for tetracycline. The only treatment that worked for me was the prescription, BUT it makes birth control pills INEFFECTIVE!!! No thanks, I'm not getting pregnant for the sake of having a clear face. So I finally stumbled across this sulfur-based product at Walmart this week. Wow, I'm so impressed and thankful I found this little tube of beige goo.<br /><br />I used it as a spot treatment the very first night I purchased it. My two forehead pimples that previously became gooey (again) overnight were dry! The next morning I used the creme all over my face, under my foundation. Again, my pimples stayed dry throughout the day, AND the overall oiliness of my skin was much improved! Finally! I think I've found something that actually works. Happy dance!!<br /><br />Note, it does NOT provide much coverage (for me, anyway). But I just applied my normal concealer over this product, and it worked beautifully. Because the pimple stayed dry, I didn't have to reapply concealer.<br /><br />It does have a *slightly* unpleasant odor, but I only smell it occasionally. I doubt anybody else can smell it unless they're, like, licking your face or are sitting WAY within your bubble of personal space.<br /><br />I'm so happy the sulfur is helping my skin.

You work it into your skin for a couple of minutes, then leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.  There are no unpronounceable ingredients in it, and it smells like peppermint.  It's a very thick bilious colored liquid dispensed through the bottle cap.  I've used it four times with great results on my skin and one unexpected but welcome side effect.<br /><br />The MTC initially feels like mud, but there's a really refreshing tingle that's just great first thing in the morning.  If you're of the generation that used a product called Seabreeze, that's exactly the sensation, only stronger.  The tingle doesn't go away until the stuff is rinsed off, either, and skin feels really clean.  I have some large pores around my nose, and they're thoroughly flattened by<br />this stuff.<br /><br />If you have dry skin, go easy with this, and use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I have an oily T Zone with dry cheeks, and have learned to concentrate on my oily areas with the MTC, with just a quick once over on the dryer areas of my face.  I've been using this just before showering in the morning, and then using the shower to rinse it off--and here's the unexpected side effect: my miserable early spring sinuses have improved!  I think it's the herbs in the product coupled with the steam from the shower, but my whole sinus area feels SO much more open.  Hooray!<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this product.  My skin feels awake and energized, and the products I use daily--serums, moisturizer, and BB cream--just sink right in after use.

I suspect that this cloth has some sort of chemical on it that I reacted to, but I have been unable to determine who the manufacturer is so that I can call them and find out.  Unfortunately I bought it a few months ago so it's too late to return it.  Pretty sure that I waaaaay overpaid for it, too.", "images": [], "asin": "B08945VD8J", "parent_asin": "B08945VD8J", "user_id": "AHIEUYZU7RDD5LVP665QOM2QPPQQ", "timestamp": 1640022384296, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Love!", "text": "First, I'll say this: this is a beautiful set of brushes, and I absolutely love them. It was like Christmas morning, opening this package!  However, the largest brush got incorrectly placed in the packaging at the manufacturing/assembly point (see photo), and the bristles on that side are now misshapen.  Obviously, that will affect the performance of the brush, and I'm not going to mess with washing it and trying to reshape the bristles (which probably won't work anyway).  So I ordered another set, and the first defective one will be returned.  Hopefully, the second one will be better.  I docked a star for this, but if the second one comes in better shape, and the brushes hold up long-term (or don't), I may change my rating.<br /><br />EDIT: Ordered a second one, but waited to send back the first one.  So glad I did.  The replacement was in worse shape than the first, with THREE brushes shifted out of place and potentially crimped in the same way (see photo).  So I didn't even open it, I just sent the second one back.  More care needs to be taken by the seller and manufacturer.  If you don't mind dealing with this type of hassle, try them.  I'm hoping that my large brush's shape self-corrects after I wash it for the first time.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqf1BjgyL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqf1BjgyL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqf1BjgyL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81izWu5xPbL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81izWu5xPbL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81izWu5xPbL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08YR3JMCG", "parent_asin": "B08YR3JMCG", "user_id": "AHIEUYZU7RDD5LVP665QOM2QPPQQ", "timestamp": 1624205880567, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

I bought it for myself, but I was so impressed with the set that I bought two more (as Christmas gifts) when they were on sale for ten bucks.  I don't paint my nails much, but I finally gave this a try about 10 days ago. It went on beautifully, with full coverage in one coat. It dried super fast & was hard as nails when dry (about 10-15 minutes). Once it was completely dry, it had absolutely no odor. Zero. This is something that's important to me because I'm sensitive to fragrances. As the days went by, it held up extremely well. It didn't chip at all, but just wore off naturally on the very tips of my nails. Looked like a natural grow-out, instead of chipping. Ten days later, it was finally time for a re-do. I was very impressed with this product, all around (at least the peach, which is the only one I've tried so far). I'll come back and update, if my experience with the other colors isn't the same.", "images": [], "asin": "B088BFFQPW", "parent_asin": "B088BFFQPW", "user_id": "AHIEUYZU7RDD5LVP665QOM2QPPQQ", "timestamp": 1599358911084, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

If you're wearing a sleeveless shirt and don't want your bra straps to show, it will hold them in place well and keep them hidden.  However, my favorite way to use them is on old bathing suits that have the straps all stretched out.  I use one of these, and the bathing suit becomes an X back that has renewed life in it.  I like to wear old bathing suits this way to work around the yard and in my garden, with a pair of shorts over them.  I originally got these two years ago for my sister's wedding, but I have since worn them many times.  Yes, eventually if you use them hard they will snap and break.  But they are great to have on hand.  I don't find them that hard to put on.  If my husband is available, I'll ask him to put them on for me once my suit is on.  But if he's not, I will put then on the bathing suit carefully and then step into the suit.<br /><br />Update on 8/1/11 I reordered four packages of these, which as pictured are the exact same ones I got before.  What I received was a different product.  I am not thrilled with the new improved version.  They don't sit completely flat like the old ones did.  I think I'm going to return three of the packages, or maybe all four.  I'm disappointed that I didn't receive the tried and true ones that I ordered.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Spill proof lid yeah not quite", "text": "Cup seems very good quality. I bought this SPECIFICALLY for the spill proof lid. The slider part leaks like a sieve. I spilled hot coffee as soon as I started moving. NOT COOL. I'm really not happy but can't justify spending almost HALF of what I paid to send it back. MAJOR disappointment.<br /><br />***update*** 3/29/17<br /><br />So after my initial review on this cup expressing my extreme disappointment with the so-called spill proof lid, I was contacted buy a customer representative from Gus. He expressed his apologies and they ended up refunding my total purchase price even after I told them they didn't have to and sent me a replacement lid.<br /><br />Unfortunately they did not understand my complaint was not about the rubber gasket around the lid itself but the slider that covers the drinking hole. It is the slider that leaks because it does not seal. I informed them of my opinion on the design, which is I believe is a poor design for what is supposed to be a spill free top.<br /><br />Having said that, the Cup itself is absolutely fantastic. It's well-made and does indeed keep my coffee hot for quite a while. I have not tested it with cold yet. The way Gus stands behind their product definitely tells me that there concern is for customer satisfaction.<br /><br />They were very prompt and courteous. I really can't ask any more of them. I have put the rating up to 4. If nothing else it's  because of the simple fact they reached out to me to try and make it right. That to me speaks volumes of this company's commitment to ensuring their customers are happy. That's not something you see a whole lot of these days.<br /><br />If they can come up with a design that makes the lid truly spill free I would definitely buy this again.", "images": [], "asin": "B01M1DZ7X8", "parent_asin": "B01M1DZ7X8", "user_id": "AG5SNCL4FSHAAB4MFKI3YU5ZAEMQ", "timestamp": 1490270606000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Awesome for Cold sores/Herpes simplex 1 sufferers", "text": "I never heard of this before until a friend turned me on to it saying it's been used to treat cold sores. I thought, why not I was desperate as I've suffered from cold sores since childhood (I'm over 40 btw). I have tried many things, diet changes, protection on lips when out in the sun and wind, I still get those painful cold sore blisters that last for days and crack and bleed when you smile or eat. It's annoying as heck. This is the best thing ever and I'm posting on here in hopes that some poor soul out there will benefit as much as I have. Basically at the first sign of a cold sore when y ou feel the tingly, sensitive feeling or see the first sore, just dab a bit on 2x a day or more if you are constantly wiping it off somehow. It will not spread or grow at all. For the first time yesterday I put a bit on after the cold sore grew a bit and basically it stopped it from growing and has made it disappear over 2 days in a non painful way at all. This is magical. Sadly not advertised as a cold sore medicine. Also, so many more expensive options for herpes simplex 1/cold sores do not work! This is more affordable. This container will last forever because I typically use maybe 1/2 pinky nail each time. Good luck! *Update, I had a dry rash around my neck for months, nothing too serious but slightly itchy every now and again. I put some of this cream on it 2x/day for about 10days, gone. Hasn't come back, it's been over a month. I just figured if it worked on coldsores, it would work on my rash.

I quickly opened the product and went to use it.  The Bold Forest scent was very nice.  I always wash my beard at the end of my shower so as to not let the smell of my beard wash be diminished by other scents from hair and soap on my face.  I put a nickel sized drop of the shampoo into my hand and then worked it together with the other hand.  I can really smell the Eucalyptus smell as it gives way to almost a menthol scent.  I made sure my beard was wet and ready for the shampoo.  I worked the shampoo into my beard for about 30 seconds or so with my fingers and at the end of that had a really nice lather going on.  After the lather, I just stood there for about another minute and allowed the shampoo to just sit in order to get the smell really worked in there.  I made sure to thoroughly rinse out the product and man was my beard squeaky clean after that.  After drying off and getting all the water out of my beard, I smelled it and there was a faint scent of the shampoo left over from the shower.  I followed up the shampoo with Beardsmen Spirit Beard Oil in the Bold Forest scent.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I did receive a discounted price in order to try this product and provide an unbiased review.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Mine had defects", "text": "First, the good: hair is soft, silky and only a tiny bit too shiny. It has good style and only shed a small amount on removing from package and brushing. Not too much hair, but not thin or flimsy. Has two combs at the top in front to secure wig, and the adjustable latches at the neck. I was prepared to love it forever and buy ten more. However:<br />The not so good and the bad: the color is flat black, there is no natural color variation and looks like a poor dye job, the ear tabs did not align with my actual ears, and so poked out to the sides a bit. The hair line would not lay flat to my head, and when I tried to pull some of the front strands to the side to keep them out of my eyes, I saw that the seams are thick and obvious. Since it has a bit of lace at the top I figured to reset the part, but there is a seam in the middle of the lace, so parting it<br />in any other location within the lace area literally shows a fat black seam.<br /><br />Now, I am not a wig expert. I don't know how to make a mediocre wig great, and to this wig's credit, it is better than mediocre. So if you happen to be one of those people with such knowledge, this is a fabulous wig to mess with and work your magic on. And perhaps my particular wig is a defect that slipped through, but regardless, it is a disappointment to me. I would return it, but I made the mistake of cutting the lace right away (like I said, I was excited about how great the wig looked lol).

Some nudes, darker beiges, etc. The khaki shade is a nice neutral but a bit too pale;, and the few sheer shades they offer are very nice for long-lasting daily wear.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works as the other 50+ raters have stated...", "text": "I have adult onset acne. I have had it for over a decade. Nothing would cure it. Benzyl peroxide makes me break out worse and rash up. >2% salicylic acid spot treatment products help, but nothing really evened everything out and made the acne start to go away. I wouldn't say this is a miracle, but it certainly is the only thing that I have found in the past 10 years that works (and yes I have seen 3 dermatologists for this issue with no permanent resolution).<br /><br />The Routine:<br />I apply this glycolic product 1x at night and a light face moisturizer 1x in the morning (plus an eye cream when I remember). I started seeing immediate results within less than 2 weeks. I also, after reading so many scarey reviews about negative product interactions, am happy to report that I had NO additional breakouts with the product and only light tingling for the first few minutes of application. I would compare this tingling to the feeling you get just after applying a witch hazel cotton pad (for those with pain concerns regarding the 'tingle' reported by others).<br /><br />Regarding Results 2 Weeks In:<br />For those of us that have had long term acne and know how good we look in summertime (due to the sun hiding your acne spots) this is how I feel now, two weeks later, when I see myself in the mirror. I don't know how well it will treat these recesses (old acne scars) I have in my cheek area, but the red splotches are gone and skin tone has evened substantially.<br /><br />I also should be honest and say that the use of a glycolic product was recommended to me from my identical twin sister (yay for matching DNA and two people trying to solve the same problem at once). Anyways, she used a similar AHA product for a year (not this one exactly). However, her acne, red splotches, break outs, and scars are completely gone after 1 year of use of an AHA glycolic product. After seeing her results I thought I would find a similar product to try. (keeping fingers crossed over this year!)<br /><br />Opinion Section:<br />I saw a number of negative reviews. In reflection, I would suspect that sensitive youth skin may not benefit as much from this product as adult skin. I noticed that the product is far less drying on my face than advertised by others. Heck, I don't even bother to moisturize at night and have no ill over-drying effects. However, I worry that if you are purchasing the product for 'oil control' or have much oil production on your face this may aggravate your acne situation. I only comment this because when I get up in the morning I can still feel this product on my face - it's not greasy or oily, I just feel a sheen. This could explain some of the negative posters comments. In my experience, I think youth acne needs drying more than adult acne, which needs exfoliation. If you are in your mid 20s and up (and DO NOT have sensitive, oil - prone, raging hormone youth skin), then this product is relatively inexpensive and delivers!<br /><br />PS: If there is a youth out there that has the opposite of this experience, please flag this (if this review section will allow it) to remove this last paragraph for accuracy as i do not want my speculation to mislead people on a product that is in my opinion, from first hand experience, absolutely wonderful.", "images": [], "asin": "B000G8LWZI", "parent_asin": "B000G8LWZI", "user_id": "AFBUEKUYLGIQMA2XC26CXYIHNIFA", "timestamp": 1347936564000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

The Philips PureRadiance brush has two speeds, one is gentle and the other is a more intense option.  This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.<br />2.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has rotating bristles plus an pulsing feeling.  The brush head is smaller than Clarisonic, so it is easy to use in small areas such as between your nose and mouth.<br />3.  Similar to the Philips toothbrush, the PureRadiance brush has three timed sessions of 20 seconds each for three zones of your face.  This is beneficial if you have a tendency to over scrub or irritate your skin.<br />4.  The PureRadiance brush is smaller and lighter than the Clarisonic.<br /><br />The PureRadiance is a different experience from the Clarisonic.  It's not bad, just different.  If this is your first facial brush, I think you will like the PureRadiance quite a bit.  If you currently use a different brush, you'll need to compare features.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent Shaver with a few Quirks", "text": "I've been using Norelco shavers since I began shaving.  I briefly tried both another brand and bladed shaving, and didn't like either.  I tried this out as a replacement to my 8140XL.<br /><br />As with most electric shavers on the market, you get convenience, simple charging, savings on consumable blades and cream, and a nice little gadget for your bathroom with this shaver.  A blade always wins on optimum closeness, but takes longer and is more \"dangerous\" to those of us with a not so fine touch.  Those aside, there were a few things that I liked, and a few things that bugged me about this specific shaver.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Lightweight<br />Wow, this shaver is really light and easy to handle when shaving, especially tougher areas that require holding the shaver upright at times.<br /><br />-Waterproof<br />The fact that you couldn't get in contact with water or even in a shower used to be a huge disadvantage to electric razors.  This unit is fully waterproof, which also makes it easier to clean.<br /><br />-Uses Li-ion batteries instead of NiCad<br />One of the things that irked me about the last razor I bought was that it still contained a ridiculously obsolete NiCad battery.  NiCad cells suffer from the \"memory effect\", which means they can hold a smaller and smaller amount of charge over time.  This shaver has Li-Ion, the best kind of battery available, with no memory effect.  This means it will continue to hold the same charge for years to come.<br /><br />-Cool Charger base<br />This is a lot cooler looking, and takes up less space on the countertop than just plugging into the wall and laying the shaver sideways to charge.  It also keeps track of the cord.<br /><br />-Flex Tracker System<br />The head conforms to whatever surface I'm shaving pretty well, and just looks cool.<br /><br />Cons: (these won't apply to everyone, and are my opinion only)<br /><br />-Built in lotion dispenser<br />I've never wanted this feature.  It's simply another way for them to continue to charge for refills of the product, when part of the reason for having an electric razor is so you don't have to keep paying for blades!  I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn't enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  The stuff doesn't smell too great either.  You don't need this goop to use the shaver, so I would skip it.<br /><br />-Not as speedy as older models<br />This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  It's not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not slower.<br /><br />-40 minutes of charge time<br />This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this shaver, it has some great features you'll probably enjoy.  You might want to be aware of the cons I've noted, and keep in mind you can follow up on Norelco's guarantee if you're not happy with your individual shave.", "images": [], "asin": "B000UK2VRK", "parent_asin": "B000UK2VRK", "user_id": "AF2ACCKOTUKHIGCZHGHSZXMJDTKQ", "timestamp": 1215734124000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I simply section off my hair in four large segments and run the brush through each segment 2-3 times and I am done.

I'm using the oil in two ways: for aroma and, in theory, for its physiological properties. I like diffusers a lot but am too cheap and suspicious of additives to buy them often. I've been using this lavender oil along with some safflower oil and rubbing alcohol in my bedroom and it adds a nice, luxurious touch to bedtime. I've sprinkled a bit on my body pillow, too, when I feel like I want a much stronger dose of the relaxation.<br /><br />I read somewhere that mixing it with a carrier oil (I'm using rosehip oil) and rubbing it on the bottom of your feet can help with insomnia, so I've been doing that. I don't know if it's working, but it is making my feet feel softer, so that's something. I haven't experienced any respiratory or skin irritation with this product.<br /><br />The bottle is a dark brown color so that the light can't get to the oil and break it down. They sent a dropper along with the oil, which I appreciated since I didn't have others. Next I'm going to try to make some kind of reusable sachet for my drawers--I just need to figure out what scent to mix it with first.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I am always conscious and aware of the number of items and possessions I bring into my home and try to make mindful decisions, because The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up told me to.

If I post a positive review it is because I had a positive experience. If I have only positive experiences, I chalk that up to a successful exercise in mindful purchasing and decision-making.

My 35 pound Goldendoodle has been impossible to trim/comb/brush around certain parts of her body. I definitely couldn't trim her nails, even with help, and had to stop taking her to groomers because of this. They just couldn't deal with her. She would whine, contort her body and thrash and because I think biting me was imminent, I muzzled her. I still couldn't get a nail clipper near her. She fought that much. I have been trying to desensitize her since I've had her, and it just hasn't happened. I was nervous about the stability and safety of the harness, but my husband assisted in getting her hooked up, and I made sure I had everything I needed within reach before starting. I definitely would not hook your dog up too high off the ground, or leave him or her alone while in it. I know this sounds dramatic, but this product is life-changing! She was quiet as a mouse, totally still, and let me do everything she has fought me on from day one. I haven't shut up about this thing since using it. You have to keep an eye on how your dog's placement is doing as you go, and that they aren't getting wiggly or pulling their hind legs out. I also rigged up our system so that her front end was slightly higher than her back end - just a little, tiny, bit. This helped in keeping her stable and comfortable as well. If she were any heavier, I would not trust the clips or hooks included, and would purchase more sturdy hardware. However, for the price, it's definitely worth the sling alone.

You definitely still could use that and probably would have more control with the metal hook but I 90% installed these just with my fingers and the plastic cord(and pliers of course) I will add a picture once I actually style my hair now that they're on my head lol.

In my opinion Inverness makes the best quality piercing earrings on the planet. Besides the birthstone piercing earrings, I have a number of other designs as well, and a couple of months my daughter had her ears pierced with the October Rose color flower earrings, which are perfect for a 6 year-old's first pair of pierced earrings. She now also has a pair of Inverness Rainbow Flower earrings as well which she switched to after her Rose ones had been in for over 6 weeks.<br />When it came time to pierce my daughter's ears, I would not have trusted them to any other piercing system than Inverness, as not only are their earrings second to none when it comes to quality, but the same can be said for their piercing system & piercing instruments. My daughter actually smiled throughout the piercing.<br /><br />Now, about the earrings - These Inverness Piercing Earrings, such as the 3mm Birthstone Post Earrings are extremely well-made with the strong posts that are honed to a sharp surgical point which not only adds to the ease of the piercing, but they are covered in the ear the Inverness Patented Safety Clutch, which is sort of a bell-shaped earring back, that safely covers the point of the post end and cannot by easily removed by little hands.<br /><br />As an adult who at this point has no need to continue to wear piercing earrings, I actually prefer to wear many styles of Inverness Piercing Earrings, and the birthstones are some of my very favorites. I'm sure that there are many adults who had their ears pierced years ago, who still have their Inverness Piercing Earrings in their jewelry boxes, and more importantly still wear them. They are that good.", "images": [], "asin": "B005KBOTDI", "parent_asin": "B005KBOTDI", "user_id": "AEFK4A22W4P6TW7ZVV2UJN7Z53RA", "timestamp": 1386681009000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

You aren't going to fool anyone into thinking this is your real hair. This is only going to work for if you are doing costuming. The color is so off for me.

The streaks look like white or gray to me. Then there is the part, which screams, &#34;Hello I am a wig!&#34; So chemo patients, or people with Alopeca....this is not your solution. If you are looking for a Cheap wig to go with a costume....ok, this will work for you. If this is for a costume, be aware this ships from China and will take 2 weeks to deliver. Plan ahead if there is a costume event you are planning to attend in this item. IF you are only intending to wear this as part of a costume, then this is not a bad product, you may not care that it doesn't look &#34;natural&#34; on.

I won't be able to wear this to work or out of the house. My fault for looking for a cheap solution.  Again, if you have lost your hair to chemo.....keep looking....invest in a more upscale wig shop.

If you can't tell, I'm really impressed by the compact ability of this water flosser.<br /><br />It comes with a variety of tips, enough to make this usable for a couple as my husband and I share it. It is very easy to use, the one call out if you have a more traditional water flosser is that this is a rechargeable unit! It comes with a charging cord (USB), but no base -- so you'll have to grab one of your existing ones and let this charge for about 8 hours -- so you can't use it straight out of the box.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that even at maximum pressure it is not as strong as our previous one. It does work well enough to get any extra stuff out of your teeth after brushing, however, it is not the strongest water flosser -- my husband would like something a bit more strong, but that is really the only complaint we have!", "images": [], "asin": "B088R5YRMJ", "parent_asin": "B088R5YRMJ", "user_id": "AG3CK7F7NP5GM6BN6OHZJRWWF7QA", "timestamp": 1605721251517, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

If I was to try to describe this and provide an example, I would compare it to gel hand soap. It's not thick and viscous at all, it feels much more similar to general gel hand soap. I use this for the days that I wear makeup, it is not a product that I use daily. If I wear anything more than brow filler, then I use this. It's the first step in my routine when I wear make up, as it works well to remove the light foundation and concealer that I use. I use a pump or two and massage it into my face and then rinse with water -- this doesn't lather like washes do, but it works. I does a great job at removing face makeup -- however, I stick to eye makeup remover or micellar water if I wear any eye makeup.<br /><br />Overall this is great for removing makeup. It by no means replaces a face wash, but it's a great pre-step when you have worn makeup during the day. I tried it on a fuller face of makeup and it works wonderfully as well.

He has a thick beard that our friends describe as a &#34;lumberjack beard.&#34; Since our recent move, he started complaining that his beard became stiffer and more wiry -- I can attest to that, it was more wiry than usual when I got kisses. I saw this beard oil online, and read reviews that the tea tree scent was really pleasant and fresh smelling. When I told my husband about the beard oil, he was somewhat skeptical at first, however, after reading him some reviews, I convinced him that he should take the plunge and try it, for both our sakes. The instructions on the box say to apply the oil prior to styling, but my hubby prefers applying it before bedtime, when he applies his moisturizer. Since he started applying it, he has noticed that his beard, and the skin under his beard has been soft and smooth. It also helps that he really likes the scent. The tea tree scent is very fresh and masculine, and can be worn during the day when going out or to work. It's a bonus that it smells nothing like strong aftershave scents that I am allergic to. I think my hubby will be a loyal customer of beardsmen beard oil!

I have a difficult beard and have used Philips Norelco products on it for over 40 years. I passed my 3 year old and more expensive Norelco off to my 90 year old father-in-law and he is thrilled with it. His old, cheap, noisy, corded one was getting too much for him to handle. I bought this as a personal replacement. I was skeptical about being able just to rinse it under hot water, but that works just fine. Battery management is not as good as my previous one (as other reviewers noted) but I can easily get 10 days out of it before recharging. Bottom line, if you want a good battery electric shaver and don't want to spend a lot for features you might not need or want, this will do the job. I note that a \"leading consumer mag\" gave it a good middle of the road rating in this month's issue. That reinforced my feeling that I made a good choice for the price - performance sweet spot.

The Essence is a a basic Sonicare brush without advanced features.  The brush is perfect for first time Sonicare users who don't want to spend a lot.  The toothbrush will do what you need to keep your teeth and gums in good shape without breaking the bank. The Essence does come with a 2 minute timer, which is a great feature at this price range.  The timer really helps you get all your teeth clean without spending too much time in one area.<br /><br />The Airfloss is a nice way to help your gums if you are not fond of doing regular flossing.  Regular floss is the best way to go but if you are like me and are not good at doing that often, the Airfloss is a great way to go to help improve gum health.  I usually put in a fluoride mouthwash into the floss liquid reservoir and that works well.  I find it easy to move around my mouth with the Airfloss and I can complete the flossing very quickly.<br /><br />For the price of this package, you get a good entry level Sonicare and the Airfloss, both will help with improving your teeth and gum health.

Every other time, clean it.<br />Every 6th time charge it. By blowing every shave and cleaning every other....... you get 90 days out of a fluid refill, not 30.<br />The base detects how much [stuff] is in the fluid, and when it gets too much ,forces you to change cartridges or it will not work.(clean) To make your batteries last an extra year.. once a month let them run down completely, then charge. Theres a difference between being cheap and throwing money away. I just get to buy more toys. Aint that whats its about? Closest shave ever? Not really, but fuctional enough to be worth it.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very inclusive set", "text": "This set has a lot to it! There are 24 eyebrow shapes, a facial razor, a brush/spoolie combo, and a two colored powder.  The powder has a darker tone and a lighter tone, and both apply easily with the rounded foam head. The powder itself is stored in the cap so it refreshes each time you close it.<br /><br />The 24 eyebrow styles are a bit overwhelming but maybe some people like to have that much choice. The shapes all need to have the center pushed out of the plastic before use; they come with it still tacked on in place.<br /><br />The brush and spoolie are small so I recommend using your own as this one is hard to hold.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great brush, some drawbacks", "text": "Update:  I am lowering my rating to 3 stars because of the difficulty and expense of finding and buying replacement heads.  I couldn't find any for quite some time.  I've since found some online, not on Amazon, but from a low of $19.99 (but out of stock) to more than $25 for a single head.  The difficulty and cost makes buying this brush too impractical, which is too bad because I like the unit.<br />~~~~~~~<br /><br />The toothbrush I reviewed is the similar model, EW-DE92.  I was taken to this page when I tried to post my review.<br /><br />First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the \"white\" mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner's guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.<br /><br />I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use \"white\" most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don't use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn't feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.<br /><br />Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.<br /><br />The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.<br /><br />But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to \"Contact an authorized service center for repair.\"  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.<br /><br />One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don't like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.<br /><br />While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.

The set comes in this dual sided book. The brushes are a wide variety of styles. I have used them for about a week now and have a pretty good idea of their performance. First they are pretty sturdy, so that is nice in your hand. They didn't shed when washed, and that is huge!!!! The face brushes are really nice and pick up product great and distribute it just as nice. The eyeliner brushes are nice also. There are several different sizes to get the type of line you want. The eyeshadow brushes I am on the fence with. First the hairs are not even on all of them, if you want to even it up you would need to pluck out the stray guy. The cut on the eye brushes are ok on some and not so much on others. They feel scratchy when trying to blend out your product. The other thing is that none of the brushes indicate the intended use. That is not a bad thing, but I think for someone getting into makeup, they may be overwhelmed  with the volume of the brushes and not know what to do with them.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This nifty, solidly built, silent, little tool is THE BOMB!", "text": "I am amused at what I let friends talk me into.  As an Aesthetic RN (Yeah, that's right, Botox, Fillers... painful Machines both large and small ;-) I fancy myself to have a healthy skepticism about the latest fads in health, beauty, and 'De-age-ification'. A girlfriend of mine REALLY wanted me to buy this Rose Quartz Roller. She gave me lots of reasons about lifting and tightening which fell on deaf ears. But then she mentioned Lymphatic Drainage. That got my attention. There is a snippet of good research to support lymphatic drainage as a valid de-age-ification tool. Not enough to get me to buy this thing. But, the research exists.<br /> The reason I bought the Rose Quartz Roller is because I have ALLERGIES. When I was a child in the Midwest, I was allergic to the month of June. Now, I live on the Left Coast and my \u201chayfever\u201d is 365/24/7. I take daily antihistamines, I pop an additional Mucinex and 12 hour pseudoephedrine to clear out my head weekly. When it gets really bad, I end up on my back, on my bed, drugged up, hot steam going, and massaging my face to aid my lymphatic drainage. This process helps. I can usually get things cleared up enough to breath through my nose and get to sleep.<br /> NOW, I have this handy little tool. When I have a few extra moments in the morning or evening I quickly run it in counts of 10 strokes over my lymphatic pathways. I either work from the chin up or from my eyes up then my cheeks down. Always sweeping from the center outward, I was taught to work the pathways of the face all the way down the outside of the neck, to the clavicles. With this roller, it takes me very little time. I can feel the motion of all the annoying stuff in my sinuses as it clears. The small roller end is great for the eyes and upper face and the larger end simplifies the lower face and neck. The Rose Quartz Roller changes lymphatic massage from something I would take the time for when I absolutely had to do it, to a fun and easy once or twice a day part of my self care routine. This nifty, solidly built, silent, little tool is THE BOMB!<br /> Then bonus round...

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works as advertised and better", "text": "I have been using a Norelco T370 trimmer for several months.  I bought it for the mini-shaver initially, decided to grow a beard, then trimmed the beard with the beard trimmer attachment.  It did a great job of shaping and trimming, but left a mess of clippings in the sink.  After reading a million reviews, I decided to try the T980 for it's vacuum feature.<br /><br />The T980 is great!  It does a perfect job of trimming my beard evenly (setting at 7, ultimate beard length to be a 9).  The best part is that about 90% of the clippings go into the vacuum receptical with only about 10% being lost.  I have not come across any of the negatives (adjustment slips, tugs hairs and on and on) mentioned in other reviews.  Unlike my T370, this trimmer lets you know when it's fully charged or about to go dead, and even if it does die in the middle of a session from a dead battery, plugging it in finishes the job.  Most other trimmers only work when charged, not on house current.<br /><br />I can't think of anything this trimmer could do better.  In my estimation it's looks, design and operation are flawless.  The clipper works well on my beard's 'neckline' and the mini-trimmer keeps the bottom of my mustache trimmed perfectly.  I really think the T370 does as good a job trimming as this one does, but will not run with a dead battery when plugged in, and does make a mess with beard clippings all over the place.  For those two reasons alone, this trimmer is a BEST BUY!<br /><br />I am not putting the T370's abilities down in any way.  For the price it can't be beat.  It trims well and the mini-shaver is still the best way to shave the short hairs on my cheeks above my beard on a daily basis.  I use it daily along with the T980 and will continue to.  They both have their place.  If you don't mind the beard trimmings everywhere, you will be happy with the T370, however if you are serious about perfect beard grooming (and I DO mean PERFECT), with none of the mess, both tools are a must.", "images": [], "asin": "B000FEF1V4", "parent_asin": "B000FEF1V4", "user_id": "AGDC7ZZINCIWF33DHXNAR2KASB6A", "timestamp": 1186004541000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

I looked at my cosmetics and face care collection and it just hit my how much waste I am producing in the name of vanity.  I also don't really have the time to sit down and make my own home brewed recipes either.  Stumbled across the Ethique brand and it was like aaaaaaaaahhhh.  One single use plastic down.  This is on par with what I pay for my other serums, if not actually a little cheaper.  I was able to try it in the sample pack - DO IT THERE FIRST!!  This sadly will not be a serum for everyone.  I have really, really, really dry skin.  Just genetics.  I also work outside and play outside year round so my skin is abused.  I need very heavy moisturizers.  If you have oily skin, or even mixed, this may not work for you, or it would be best used as a once a week quench.  It takes some tinkering to find out the right amount to put on.  I screwed it up the first two nights and over did it.  Plus, since I was used it with the lotion, my face was slippery it was like teflon.  As someone else said, a little goes a long, long way.  Be patient.  I pinch of the tiniest amounts and as soon as it hits my face it melts and is able to be spread around.  Pinch and repeat.<br /><br />I think this is the bees knees personally and will be using this.  I love how it travels.  I love I don't have to feel like a froufrou girl when I go into the backcountry with a serum.  Someone could certainly ask why I have so much soap... but whatever.  I hope they take another stab at this and make a lighter version for the girls that don't need to soak their faces.  Again, try the sample pack.  You get this, three facial soaps, and the lotion at a very fair price to try before you commit to the full size.  So if you hate it, you are still bound to find something you love.

I even asked my girlfriend for some beauty tips. Nothing worked. After awhile I noticed it getting bigger so I became desperate. I did something most guys would ever do... I visited a beauty salon that specializes in skin care. Fortunately for me, the lady I spoke to didn't want to take my money and told me to just pick up a bottle of Vi-Tae Blackhead remover. She told me all this mombo jumbo about why and how it works and I pretended like I understood but it all flew over my head. I went home later that night and found it on Amazon. Honestly, I didn't want to spend $30+ dollars on a health and beauty product because, well, I'm a guy. But I took the lady's advice and went with it. Like Prime normally does, I got it in two days. I followed the directions - apply every morning to damp skin, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse. I have to be honest... I didn't see any difference after the first day. The blackhead was still there. I did it again the second day. Nothing. Third day. Zilch. Fourth day. Nada. I was becoming impatient and felt ripped off. However, after I applied it on the fifth day, the blackhead was gone after I rinsed it! I was like WHOA! This girly stuff really works. Before I start to rave about this stuff, I have to say that it didn't get it all out. If I look close enough, I can still see a tiny spec left in my pore.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I love these!", "text": "Update: this is my second time buying these braids, and as much as I love how easy they are to install, goodness do they shed. Instantly, tons of shedding from the ends all the way up. When I trim off loose pieces, very carefully, it seems to create a million more. I sleep with them in a satin scarf and don't mess with them very much, they just have a frizzy life of their own. As much as I love the color, I'm going to try a different color and maybe a different brand in the future.<br /><br />This was my first time self-installing braids already braided; as a mixed Afro-Indigenous person who didn't grow up having my hair braided and has struggled to find a method of doing it that won't give me a migraine for days (last time \ud83d\ude2c), these were such a gift.<br /><br />Super easy install; it still took several hours, but I'm new to this so I expected that. My 2C-3B  hair is very short and fine, (see photo), so I did a mixture of rubber bands and tiny braids to crochet into, with Murray's edgewax to separate and Got To Be Ultra Glued to hold it. (Thank you many YouTube tutorials!)<br /><br />I've had so many compliments on them, and a lot of surprise when I share they were pre-braided and self-intalled. Compared to my last  braids, these are lightweight and soft, although the blonder ends are a bit rough. I did an Apple Cider Vin + warm water soak, gentle shampoo, and a deep conditioner + warm water soak, followed by a very thorough rinse. Then I hung them to dry from their gold bands for several days before I installed them. I still have two packs left over, and have a big head! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd<br /><br />I'm honestly so happy with them, and glad I did them myself.

This kit comes with four varieties of wax beans infused with all natural extractions and oils, like chamomile, lavender, aloe, and honey, making this wax gentle enough to use on even the most sensitive skin. The kit, which requires heating up the wax before applying to the skin, has a warming pot with an adjustable heat setting to melt the beans quickly without getting it hot enough to  burn the skin, and an auto-shutoff to prevent overheating. I really like the see through lid to be able to watch the melting. The wax is very effective at removing both stubborn, course hair, and fine thinner hairs, getting  the hair follicles at the root, leaving my skin soft and smooth longer, with no irritation.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loving These Locs!", "text": "[[VIDEOID:f6fe2bb4d18d1094a8c2136bc198cd5a]] I've always loved dreads, so when I saw these, I ordered them immediately! I hadn't known I could simply *install* dreads without having to grow my own hair long and then proceed to do whatever magic (and damage) was necessary to create dreads. As soon the first set of 12 arrived, I was thrilled; I also knew that 12 strands was nowhere near enough to cover my head so I ordered a second set. Each set came with a bag of random hair accessories as well as what looks similar to a crochet hook. The hook is ridiculously small, so I don't know if it's intended to pull the hair through the top loop or if it's to help maintain the dreads as they're washed and loosen up over time. There were no instructions, so after my first set arrived I scoured the Internet to find photos of loc styles as well as tutorials about how to install them. I've included a short video with this review to help people realize that the most difficult part will be installing these on the back of your head. (I don't have a fold-out mirror and I don't trust myself to do a good job, so I've got to find someone I trust to do the back of my head for me.)<br /><br />While this is the first set of dreads I've handled, they're not stiff and they have no odor. (While researching dreads, I discovered that a lot of synthetic pieces have those issues but THESE do not! I mean, I loved the first set so much that I ordered another right away.) I don't plan to have my entire head in dreads, but if I did I could easily get away with only 3 to 4 sets (with leftovers) because my hair is really thin and I'd pull larger sections through the top loop as I braided each piece in.<br /><br />The ends of the dreads look a little scraggly BUT I think that makes them look all the more authentic; in fact, I was surprised when I hopped back online and saw these are synthetic! The top of each has a black rubber band just below a loop of hair and you basically pull a section of your own hair through that top loop, split that hair into two sections (so with the dread and your own hair you have three separate sections). Get the dread close to your scalp, then simply braid the three sections together to secure the loc into place. You'll need a small rubber band to hold the sections together where they end and it's that simple! You can attach the little hair accessories wherever you choose.<br /><br />If you've been wanting locs, these are an excellent value and the perfect way to see if the look is right for you. I do think they should come with instructions, but that doesn't take away from the perfect coloring, length, and texture!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610eKXtYMmL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610eKXtYMmL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610eKXtYMmL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj9H67rbL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj9H67rbL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj9H67rbL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RmT4m6EL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RmT4m6EL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RmT4m6EL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GAqYc8KwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GAqYc8KwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GAqYc8KwL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HxE8BPtOL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HxE8BPtOL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HxE8BPtOL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fl6SpE6kL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fl6SpE6kL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fl6SpE6kL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9eaicENL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9eaicENL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9eaicENL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0B7DZ4YV7", "parent_asin": "B0B7DZ4YV7", "user_id": "AFSAZEU3CXTOZCFVHEKOQFZ7O43Q", "timestamp": 1678017960408, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Playful and Pricey: Check Ingredients", "text": "This is my first experience using a gel-to-oil cream so I didn't know what to expect, though I hoped it'd leave my skin radiant and glowing (due to the words \"GLOW DAY CREAM\" in the name). *Note: There's no glow whatsoever.<br /><br />When I dip into a little bit of product, it's a shiny lightweight, non-sticky pink gel. As soon as I apply it to my face or to the top of my hand, it melts, spreads with ease, and leaves my skin velvety soft. The absorption rate is fairly quick compared to similar creams and oils, though usually if something is immediately devoured by my skin, there's no evidence it was there; this, however, leaves my skin smooth and without a greasy residue. It can easily be applied prior to makeup if needed. Finally, this gel has a nice medium fragrance that isn't overpowering or lingering.<br /><br />While I do like the heavy glass jar and think it looks nice, it's quite deceiving. With only one ounce of product inside, I have another jar of face cream that's the same size but contains twice the product. And when compared to other options, ingredients are crucial. (I've included a photo from the box.) While I recognize some as being good organic extracts and oils, the majority sound like chemical compounds I've never heard of.<br /><br />Being a mere breath away from 50, I need to factor in sun damage, a depletion of hormones, thinning skin, melanin spots, and overall aging when I decide what's best for my skincare. This product, while moisturizing, simply doesn't make the cut as something I'll order again.<br /><br />CONS STACKED UP:<br />- Only 1 oz of product<br />- Unfamiliar ingredients<br />- Lacking ingredients I look for based on skincare needs<br />- High price-point<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Leaves skin velvety soft<br />- Nice scent<br />- Absorbs well, no icky residue", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51--+pYZbKL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51--+pYZbKL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51--+pYZbKL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mYp0xl06L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mYp0xl06L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mYp0xl06L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edPXBKnTL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edPXBKnTL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edPXBKnTL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibOUye6ZL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibOUye6ZL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibOUye6ZL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0B1M7JRHY", "parent_asin": "B0B1M7JRHY", "user_id": "AFSAZEU3CXTOZCFVHEKOQFZ7O43Q", "timestamp": 1662613862447, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Right out of the package, the messy bun was true to its name. It was a mess! It took awhile to find the tousled strands (which I've included a close-up shot of one where it's held into its tousle with a tiny clear rubberband). I sorted through the bun and pulled all of the longer parts through one end so they might hang better for a natural look.<br /><br />I wear my hair in messy buns a lot, but I just can't get this hairpiece to look good on my head. I believe that the color does play a small role in my dissatisfaction, as the top of my hair is much more blonde BUT the underside of my natural hair that I pull up IS much darker and matches the shade of the brown tones much better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the entire design of the bun just doesn't work well on my thin hair. The photos I've shared are of it secured around a bun of my hair with a few bobby pins. I think this piece might work better for people who have thicker hair.

I am not into the beauty scene, but I have been looking for something to help me with my facial skin problems. I suffer from dry skin after showering, and then overnight it gets so oily I look as if I put oil all over my face. Of course I shower, and the process repeats itself.<br /><br />When I first got this product, I was unsure exactly how much to use of it. So I just used a little, barely touching anything. Then the next application I used more, probably more than needed, but again, I have never done this before.<br /><br />The texture was weird, and when i shook it around in the container it was like rubber. It even felt rubbery. Not sure if this was just my container, or if all of them are like this way. The smell wasn\u2019t too bad, smelled kind of like.. well dirt, which I would expect to be honest. The directions were easy to follow, and it didn\u2019t leave an oily residue on my skin, but it did feel a little dry.<br /><br />I used this product for a little over a week, I always like to give things proper time for trial. I don\u2019t judge on one day. but after a week it should have worked right?<br /><br />Wrong, my dry skin was so severe that I not only had dry skin on my forehead, but on my nose and chin too. I am pretty disappointed, but then again, every person and body is different. While it worked for other reviewers, it didn\u2019t work for me. I will give them a 3 star because their customer service and prompt shipping is amazing, and their other products that I have tried are great too!

I am happy to say the slanted pair in this set does not do that - thankfully! I was able to easily pluck my eyebrow hairs to perfection. I am not a person that is ever precise enough to use the pointed tweezers, but since they came in this set, I put them to use in a different way. I am using them to weed my vinyl designs after I cut them. They are precise and working out nicely. I also tried the flat pair, which work fine, but I really prefer the slanted overall for my uses. These come in a sparkly purple case. The tweezers are color coded with a shimmery glittery finish. Honestly, I think the color design is a bit pre-teen-like, but they are tweezers and they work, so I am not too picky about the colors. Overall, nice quality set!

No damage.  I recommend and the seller is very nice.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/21/21<br />Wanted to update a/new pics since I dyed this unit and played around with it some more.  It took color extremely well.  Watch your time though-  I only processed for about 7 minutes each section.  I did a darker smudge root and 4 different colors mixed on the rest (looks more real than one solid all over color & adds dimension).  It\u2019s so perfect.  Did not damage, still soft and when I tell you she has not shed nor broken off on me please hear me because I speak the truth!  Not even a little bit.  I was unsure of what her style would be since she ended Up in an odd shape with shipping.  But she dries to a nice scrunch wave I let her air dry n no products in these pics n you can see in the one picture I straightened one piece and it straightens beautifully with no snapping or breaking.  Lastly-  this hairline is so good n this is the first time EVER I\u2019ve encountered legit transparent lace.  I\u2019m sort of olive toned so lace always shows on me and I have to cut every bit off cuz it does not melt on me ever. Look at my pics-  notice I left some lace?? Yea.  She melts.  Completely.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "My thoughts on the Silicon Devices 150 Watt Inverter", "text": "The Silicon Devices 150 Watt Power Inverter allows you to power up all of your devices when you're on the road. This can be especially useful if you have a family and they have brought a lot of different devices with them for the trip and you want to make sure that they can always keep them charged up. The inverter is small and compact but still manages to provide you with enough power to be able to charge up most devices such as a laptop, as well as mobile devices like phones and tablets. You'll find that it has one AC outlet that lets you plug in any standard device that isn't powered by USB, such as a laptop. It also have two USB ports that can be used to power up your mobile devices. One of the USB ports has an output of 2.1 Amps, while the other is 1.0 Amps. Both of these are fast enough to charge most phones and tablets, however if you want to get the fastest charge then I would recommend using the 2.1 Amp port for tablets and phones with larger batteries and save the lower 1.0 Amp port for devices that require less power to charge.<br /><br />I have tested this out in my vehicle and I like how small and compact this thing is compared to our old inverter. It is about half of the size and still manages to have the same 150 Watt rating. I have also tried to plug in a standard USB charging hub to the AC port to test out the charge speed with more devices connected to it and that worked out great. If you have a lot more devices then those two ports can charge, then I would highly recommend picking up a hub to go with this thing. I did receive this to test out and provide feedback on but my review is honest and I do like this having this inverter in my vehicle for trips.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKzuCfMlL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKzuCfMlL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKzuCfMlL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vmbze9a3L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vmbze9a3L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vmbze9a3L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01AJ4A4CA", "parent_asin": "B01AJ4A4CA", "user_id": "AGLL2LGMWCNPBBMHVNYXQ3PCREFQ", "timestamp": 1458050812000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

This comes with 5 seperate sheets of tattoo's, and each tatoo is unique in it's own way. The tattoos are all FDA approved as non-toxic and as such can be used anywhere on your skin without any worries. This is something to keep in mind if you look for any product that goes on your skin. The tattoos are all supposedly inspired by what celebrities have, however there is none that I can recognize, but I'm sure they are correct. To apply the tattoo of your choice, just look for the one you want, cut it out from one of the sheets, peel off the clear plastic and then place it face down on the body part where you want the tattoo. Next, use a washcloth that is wet and place it over the tattoo for 20-30 seconds and you can now peel back the paper and you will notice that it has transferred perfectly. I've tried a lot of the ones I received and they all went on without any issues or with any only partially transferring like I've experienced with other temporary tattoos in the past. The tattoos are unique, high quality, non-toxic and they come with a 30 day money back guarantee with no questions asked. Just tell them you want your money back, and they'll refund you which means there is no risk to buying these awesome tattoos!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my review.

When I did use it as a hot oil treatment though, my hair looked healthier afterwards. The one thing that I love the most about this product is that a little goes a long way and that it smells divine. The scent is just intoxicating. I am in the process of trying it as an overnight treatment under a shower cap along with coconut oil and will see how that helps. Definately a product worth trying (especially if you shower in the morning and can leave it on a long time) and at a reasonable price.", "images": [], "asin": "B002BPY7H4", "parent_asin": "B002BPY7H4", "user_id": "AHW3M55VAZCUCY4ED3P6IXYHT2RA", "timestamp": 1287812437000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Smell amazing", "text": "I was kind of bummed when we sold our house and the new place didn\u2019t have a jacuzzi tub. I loved my baths with soothing bath bombs. So I started scouring the internet for a solution and found these shower bombs! They smell so good... EVERY scent. My almost 2 year old loves grabbing one every time we shower (she now expects one lol.) They fizz up if directly under the water or very slowly melt if not directly in water. The first one we used I followed the directions and kept it out of the direct water. This bomb lasted at least 3 15 minute showers so a good 45 minutes. This brings me to my only complaint. They are very fragrant but for some reason when in the shower out of the direct water I couldn\u2019t really smell it. Our shower is fairly big along with our bathroom and we only have a shower curtain on it. I\u2019m guessing the smell would be more powerful in a smaller bathroom. After the first shower not smelling as powerful as I would like I tried playing with the bomb. I put it directly in the shower (lasted about 15 minutes.) Tried close to the water but not directly in it. None of these really helped with the power of the scent. For the price and the fact that they last so long I will be reordering them as we are almost out and the toddler will be upset if she doesn\u2019t have her shower bomb.

If you're not experienced with what that smell is, don't think \"cigarettes\" or smoke when you see this term used; Tobacco is a subtly sweet and warm, earthy scent. It's a nice beard oil -- absorbs quickly and leaves his beard far more supple than if he forgot to apply any oil. (Which he does often enough that I need to remind him. *cough*) I'm a big fan of most scents deemed \"masculine\" or earthy: like tobacco, patchouli, oak, cedar, leather, pine, etc. Unfortunately, I'm finding the vanilla note in this to be far too heavy and overwhelms the tobacco -- so keep that in mind if you're buying this for the tobacco scent. So, although I'd really give it a solid 3.5 stars, I'm feeling generous since it seems like a nice oil blend despite the overly sweet vanilla scent.

Btw the smell of the whole esquire men's hair products are annoying but you can quickly reduce it by opening the lid for a day.", "images": [], "asin": "B079TGGJ1Y", "parent_asin": "B079TGGJ1Y", "user_id": "AHEPKZHRE6AW4YYFBW3EQADXE5MQ", "timestamp": 1562217162832, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
