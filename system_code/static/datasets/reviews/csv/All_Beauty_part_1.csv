5.0,Such a lovely scent but not overpowering.,"This spray is really nice. It smells really good, goes on really fine, and does the trick. I will say it feels like you need a lot of it though to get the texture I want. I have a lot of hair, medium thickness. I am comparing to other brands with yucky chemicals so I'm gonna stick with this. Try it!",[],B00YQ6X8EO,B00YQ6X8EO,AGKHLEW2SOWHNMFQIJGBECAF7INQ,1588687728923,0,True
4.0,Works great but smells a little weird.,"This product does what I need it to do, I just wish it was odorless or had a soft coconut smell. Having my head smell like an orange coffee is offputting.

5.0,Great for at home use and so easy to use!,This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it!

5.0,Nice shampoo for the money,"I get Keratin treatments at the salon at least 3-4 times a year (would do it more often if I could afford it). I am always in the market to use products that can help extend my salon visits. This Keratin shampoo is really nice. It is sulfate free (which is the first thing I look for ) and makes my hair feel silky smooth and soft. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve the texture and appearance of your hair.

3.0,Not what I thought I would be getting,"I was very disappointed when I got this facial scrub. I had assumed it was like other scrubs I use but it wasn't. This is a powder which you need to mix with water to make a paste before you put it on your face. I have a tendency to like to use scrubs in the shower with me, so this extra step doesn't really work for me. As far as the scrubbing factor goes, it's ok. I didn't feel a real smoothing or softening of my skin after use the way I have with others. The biggest plus is the fragrance (i love the smell of oranges). I won't be repurchasing.",[],B08DHTJ25J,B08DHTJ25J,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1626211245370,0,False
5.0,A little goes a long way!,"This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin.

3.0,Just ok,"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.",[],B07SLFWZKN,B07SLFWZKN,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1619737501209,0,False
5.0,Good quality hair brush!,"Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best.

5.0,Great refreshing skin care routine!,"I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month.

3.0,Didn't do much and difficult to place and maintain on your face,"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.",[],B08M3C6LVS,B08M3C6LVS,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1607339460872,0,False

5.0,Wonderful overnight cream!,"To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",[],B07W397QG4,B07W397QG4,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1593352422858,1,False
5.0,This really works!,"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!",[],B07GDQPG12,B07GDQPG12,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1547589843451,0,False

The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine).

5.0,Great combo pack. Wish I had been using this years ago!,"I love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!",[],B01M7UMAUG,B01M7UMAUG,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1508770624887,0,False
3.0,I just don't get it,"I don't see the fuss with this toothbrush. As was mentioned in other reviews, it is smaller and more lightweight than other rechargeable toothbrushes. But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean.

1.0,halo hair extensions,"This halo hair extension is simply put, garbage.  Now, you get what you pay for.  And this is a very cheap version.  The faux hair is very shiny and looks literally like bad barbie hair.  It looks WAY better in the photos than in real life.  The color is horrific, in my opinion of course.  The streaks are like paint strips.  And all of that would be one thing - but the worst is that the hair completely fell out!  I had hand fulls of hair strands just trying to put the halo on!  And you might think - well, maybe a little loss is to be expected?  Except this was handfuls and handfuls.  I literally dropped the whole thing right into the trash.  I would say this one is a pass for hair loss alone.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

It is very emollient and has a waxy feel to it.  Because of the waxiness, it coats the skin. I used some on my feet and they became a bit slippery on the tile shower floor.

Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes.

At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day.

I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them.

Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft!

I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one.

Both of those ingredients are part of my daily skincare routine, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I did not see the recommended for ages 20-30s before ordering. It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin.

The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.

5.0,Great Quality,"I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with.

4.0,Nice Variety of Colors,"My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.",[],B01KJPFO9W,B01KJPFO9W,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1541942181487,0,False
5.0,Great Exfoliator!,"I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a rich coffee scent that is perfect for slow moving mornings. It does leave behind an ever so slightly oily texture, but it goes away after toweling off and leaves behind soft skin. I haven't noticed any difference in my cellulite, but I have read that caffeine helps with it. I don't use it for the cellulite. I like to use it for exfoliating my skin.",[],B01B6V11UY,B01B6V11UY,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1476542748000,0,True

5.0,Doesn't Sting or Burn My Eyes!,"I am in my late 40's and started using anti-aging products a few years ago. Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning. I've had to stop using some of my favorite beauty products in the past for that problem. I'm very happy with this eye cream so far!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

4.0,Best Peeling Kit I've Tried So Far,"This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn’t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I’m a busy mom, so it’s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

4.0,Fun to Use!,"My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

4.0,Slight Fading of Burns So Far,"I burned my back of my hand in a couple of spots this past fall and have been using FLAWless for a short period of time to see if it helps lesson the appearance of those burns. First of all, I would say it's more of a gel than a cream. It's a tan color and is easy to rub into the skin. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or residue. It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious. However, I am noticing that my freckles and age spots on the back of my hand are looking less noticeable and that's a welcome result.

5.0,Looks Great!,"I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great!

It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin so you can continue your skin care routine. I'm a busy mom & don't have a lot of time to just wait around!  I love the list of natural ingredients!!! I've only been using this for a couple of weeks.

5.0,Blocks the Majority of the Light to Help You Sleep!,"I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.",[],B00NNKWDI6,B00NNKWDI6,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1424200292000,4,False

I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up & wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It's only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It's still there, but it has faded a little bit. I'm excited to see what happens after more use!

However, for those who want the elegance of silk, then this delivers.<br /><br />The current price of $20.79 ($25.99 minus 20%) comes to $3.47 per band which is competitively priced for 100% Mulberry silk items like these.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LtQ1Bn72L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LtQ1Bn72L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LtQ1Bn72L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PPSBL8dLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PPSBL8dLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PPSBL8dLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09ZKWV5MK,B09ZKWV5MK,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1654314287951,1,False

3.0,Light-weight cream that is a bit tacky to start; slightly moisturizing once absorbed; scentless,"This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two negatives to me. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. Once absorbed, however, it is lightly moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is scentless. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike.

2.0,Not totally easy clean brush & tines do not pull through all the way,"I used this on my three long-haired cats and it picked up some hair. Since the surface area of the brush is small, there is not much hair that is picked up compared to other brushes. Also, I tried several of these types of brushes and this one is not as easy to clean as the others. The way this is supposed to work is to retract the bristles with the button and the hair that remains on top can be slid off. Since the tines do not retract fully on the top part of the brush, the hair does not slide off easily. Instead, I have to pick it off.<br /><br />Note that this is for long-haired pets only; I would not use this with a pet with short hair. I have three long-haired cats and even though this works some, I am not impressed for the two reasons I mentioned above. My favorite brush like this is [[ASIN:B09RH8FMMS this one]].<br /><br />The current price of $20.99 is outrageous for this as it is about $10 to $12 more than others of better or similar quality.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Pf5unNkHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Pf5unNkHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Pf5unNkHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617WaPj2j8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617WaPj2j8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617WaPj2j8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfPjskFxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfPjskFxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfPjskFxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tAiLsbM5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tAiLsbM5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tAiLsbM5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iimioKipL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iimioKipL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iimioKipL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mQIFFUBNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mQIFFUBNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mQIFFUBNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09P144WHW,B09P144WHW,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1647216897957,1,False
3.0,Great medium-density blenders; flat angle is perfect for smooth applications; bad pricing on pkg,"This is a nice set of five individually wrapped pink-colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are of medium-density.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell.

These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked.

5.0,These bandages have many uses; sticks to itself and not to skin or fur; not only tattoo grip tape,"These bandages have many uses. There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.<br /><br />The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.<br /><br />This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.<br /><br />In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced.

Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price.

3.0,Cute MOM gift but not as fragrant or impressive as I expected,"[[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718JxZzRsNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718JxZzRsNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718JxZzRsNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XyalQQ7OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XyalQQ7OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XyalQQ7OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YR-wa-VsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YR-wa-VsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YR-wa-VsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bPg319SYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bPg319SYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bPg319SYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B095CG2ZV1,B095CG2ZV1,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1631367075148,1,False

To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too - at least to me. These colors also make it perfect for the Easter Basket.<br /><br />At the current price of $6.99 it is a reasonable $1.75 per piece if I count the holder.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P8ZLSwsiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P8ZLSwsiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P8ZLSwsiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TiYaVDE1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TiYaVDE1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81TiYaVDE1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f1JrZA7BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f1JrZA7BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f1JrZA7BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B083GCHL8R,B083GCHL8R,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1626976613839,1,False
2.0,Pretty headband but it is too slinky to stay put in my hair,I thought I would love this headband.

3.0,Love the blender sponges but I am not crazy about the brush,"There is one recessed foundation brush in this set along with three blender sponges.<br /><br />The brush is not high quality. I love the unique container as the brush comes out of the tube the same way lipstick does. However, the container is thin and the bristles are only marginally soft and definitely feel synthetic and are shiny. However, there is no shedding. A brush like this is good for travel where it will be used sparingly.<br /><br />The star of this set are the three blender sponges. There are two sponges with a flat side which is great for smooth applications. The other sponge is a typical egg-shaped sponge that is good for blending or any large make-up application. These blenders feel good in the hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. They do have a slight smell to them but it is not offensive.<br /><br />The current price of $10.99 for 4 pieces comes to a pricey $2.75 per item. I love the sponges and to me they are five stars; however the brush is 2 stars to me. This brush only makes sense for travel or someone who wants a brush that remains covered and will not soil their other make-up applicators or bag. Note that the packaging is more than double the size of the products within. I can fit three sets of these in the box it came in.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81chu5JJFBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81chu5JJFBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81chu5JJFBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91qvXCibQwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91qvXCibQwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91qvXCibQwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B092D43C8Q,B092D43C8Q,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1625692049016,1,False

Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses.

The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously.

This is perfect for cheek highlighting.<br /><br />The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also, the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.<br /><br />This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey.

4.0,Wafer-thin portable soap; dissolves instantly; good lather; fragrance does not come thru on hands,"There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lZIsHJeSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lZIsHJeSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lZIsHJeSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hGrOV6xfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hGrOV6xfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hGrOV6xfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mQo7zt6iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mQo7zt6iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mQo7zt6iL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09473GGM4,B09473GGM4,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1624274497670,1,False

4.0,Supposedly has UVA/UVB sun filter but doesn’t list SPF; it’s lightly hydrating,I love the results of this lotion. It is creamy and not too thin or thick and absorbs easily. I applied this to my face and neck and felt lightly hydrated. It does say there is a UVA/UVB sun filter in this but it does not say what SPF it is. The only other negative is that it took me about one minute to get the product to dispense from the pump bottle on initial use only.

4.0,"Excellent for applying creams, mask products,etc. but I wish the arm was stiffer","I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc. There are two large wands in this package. They are single-sided and have a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end that is good for washing my face with soap and water or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product. <br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the wand bends too easily. I would have preferred if the arm was a bit stiffer to make it easier to work with and allow me to apply more pressure.<br /><br />Overall, this set is excellent and about 7 inches long. It is soft on my skin, pliable, and long enough to hold on to. <br /><br />The current price of $9.90 comes to a competitively priced $4.95 per wand.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KEjnb--qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KEjnb--qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KEjnb--qL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p4kpF+DNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p4kpF+DNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p4kpF+DNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08YX4M6T1,B08YX4M6T1,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1621205988847,1,False

Yes the brush is a beautiful blue, with a fantastic gloss, and looks great, feels nice in my hands, and brushes my fine short to medium curly hair well. However, the brush stinks to high heaven and reminds me of the smell of burning rubber tires.

4.0,Love the colors in this sponge set; sponge texture is light; metal holder is great,"This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink, burgundy, and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder, a silicone brush cleaner, and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market. <br /><br />The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.<br /><br />These feel good in the hands, blend reasonably well, and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.<br /><br />The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me. <br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qAxfA3qCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qAxfA3qCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qAxfA3qCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sCZG+9VKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sCZG+9VKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sCZG+9VKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08QRSNJW9,B08QRSNJW9,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1621138223667,1,False

3.0,Nice set of 7 iridescent scrunchies; material can be slippery on hair,"There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option.

However, only seven are supposed to be shipped.<br /><br />These hair ties are dressy and nice. The scrunchie expands to hold a good amount of hair. Of course, when applying one of these, it is important to turn it so the tail goes down. That can sometimes be tricky.<br /><br />The only negative I see is that the seam shows the stitching as can be seen in my photo. They should have covered this with the area that is tied (meaning the area where the tail flows down).

5.0,"Spatulas are excellent for applying creams, mask products, etc.; brush pads good for face washing","I have really been getting into silicone spatulas/brush sets for applying face creams, bacitracin on a scar, etc.  This set includes three colorful and double-side spatulas/scrubbers. Also included are two thin purple silicone pads with finger holders that are great for washing my face.<br /><br />Each double-sided wand has a flat spatula end for applying creams or gels. The opposite side has a ribbed end and another side with larger soft nubs. The nubby side is good for cleaning or also for applying mask products. However, if the large soft nubs are used, there is more cleaning involved to wash off the mask product.<br /><br />The ""egg-shaped"" purple pads are great for scrubbing my face with soap and lathering up. I love the nub that allows me to hold on to this.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent set. These are soft on my skin, pliable, and easy to hold on to. I do wish the wands were just a few inches longer for a better grip. The current price of $13.29 ($13.99 minus 5%) is competitively priced for this set as it comes to $2.66 per item.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+k8kPDptL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+k8kPDptL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+k8kPDptL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08HDLCHXN,B08HDLCHXN,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1612821735228,0,False
3.0,I love this iron but it does not come with gloves as specified,"This flat iron comes with two strange looking hair clips and a carry pouch. However, gloves were not included in the package as I had expected. It is for this reason I lowered my rating. It is deceiving to the customer to purchase an item thinking it comes with gloves when it does not.<br /><br />The controls are in the center of the iron, so I had to be careful not to burn my fingers. To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done. <br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo. They work good enough to hold some of my hair but I particularly do not care for the design.<br /><br />The soft sided cinch pouch is nice and holds both the iron and the clips.<br /><br />In summary, this is a gorgeous iron. I love how the ""blades"" come together and there is no space in-between like some other irons I tried. Also, the current price of $25.91 ($32.39 minus 20%) is very reasonable for this. The Amazon site says ""DUAL VOLTAGE AND COMPLETE ACCESSORIES ..... Equipped with 1x storage bag, 2x hair clips, and 1x Gloves.""

4.0,Super soft back brush that lathers reasonably well & cleans well but is not exfoliating,"I have tried many different back brushes including this really good [[ASIN:B08HR2GBHC Kozis brush]] and the buff puff type that lather copiously. However, this one's bristles differ substantially. They are very fine and as soft as a cat's fur.  The soap lathers reasonably well on the bristles and the brush feels great against my skin. It is solidly built. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title says this is exfoliating and I do not consider that an attribute of this brush. The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.  The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to.

3.0,Shower caps are a bit large but they are still functional and are very attractive,"These shower caps are really attractive in the style I ordered them in. The only issue I have is that I would have preferred them to be a bit snugger. I have a small head and short to medium-length hair, so I need a smaller cap. I am still able to use this in the shower but I have to be careful it does not move around too much.<br /><br />If the elastics were snugger, I would have rated this set of three caps 5 stars.  The current price of $10.99 comes to a reasonable $3.66 each.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ur82XpxiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ur82XpxiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ur82XpxiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08HX5J4P5,B08HX5J4P5,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1611101505456,0,False
2.0,Narrow headbands that are not sturdy enough to keep the masks tight to the face,"There are six (6) velvet headbands with buttons in this set. Each headband is narrow at only 8-3/4"" wide and certainly not as wide as pictured on the Amazon site. Also, there are buttons on each side of the ear area. When I attach my mask to these buttons, my face mask is no longer tight to my face because the slinky velvet material moves and does not stay in place.<br /><br />Overall, I do not like these at all. They will suffice as headbands only and not for mask attachment.

4.0,Creamy texture; nice fragrance; takes a while to absorb but is hydrating – 3.5 stars,"I am not sure what a balancing cream is supposed to be. Nevertheless, I applied this to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). I like the creamy texture and the fragrance is decent. The aroma reminds me a little bit of St. Joseph's aspirin. It did take about ten minutes to absorb fully, but once it did my face and neck felt incredibly hydrated.<br /><br />Note that there are no English instructions on the jar or the box except for the words ""balancing cream."" This is made in Korea and it is written in Korean. If it were not for the Amazon label, no one would know that this is a hydrating face and neck cream. Also, there is no mention of how many ounces this is but I suspect it is about 4 ounces based on the price per ounce listed on Amazon.  The current price of $22.65 is pricey but competitive for this cream.

4.0,Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up,"I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth.

4.0,Nice body brushes with interesting design,"There are two body brushes in this package (pastel blue and quartz pink). Each one has a silicone sleeve into which a soft sponge has been inserted. The sleeve has a loop for hanging, nubbs on one side for scrubbing, and various small ridges on the other side for light scrubbing.<br /><br />I used the pink one in my pink bathroom; it matches perfectly. I showered with it and it holds the suds well. I personally like the nubbed side because it is like getting a massage while washing. My favorite bath ""sponge"" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This ""brush"" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this ""brush"" like the body puffs produce, I would have loved this more than my puffs.<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is on the pricey side of competitive for this as it comes to $6.30 per body brush.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V1z3PDZxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V1z3PDZxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V1z3PDZxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xB3kMSaIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xB3kMSaIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xB3kMSaIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yNTfUme9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yNTfUme9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yNTfUme9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91G972aNUjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91G972aNUjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91G972aNUjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08LGG9GSG,B08LGG9GSG,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1609849628351,0,False
2.0,"Vegetal, messy flower balls; not sure why anyone would use this for anything but tea","I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817CpxZOK1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817CpxZOK1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817CpxZOK1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819ycuv-c9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819ycuv-c9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819ycuv-c9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B1D0MIwEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B1D0MIwEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B1D0MIwEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LjxVB95BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LjxVB95BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LjxVB95BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QU2N5fZmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QU2N5fZmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QU2N5fZmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WosEgrmAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WosEgrmAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WosEgrmAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xIeKrZBRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xIeKrZBRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xIeKrZBRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yeYtqddrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yeYtqddrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yeYtqddrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VDL+Din9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VDL+Din9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VDL+Din9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lqxlrt57L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lqxlrt57L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lqxlrt57L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08KT7FCYY,B08KT7FCYY,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1609804845102,2,False

3.0,Helps to detangle my wet hair in the shower but not as good as my Heeta brush,"These brushes are actually like eight combs strung together. I had to set the extra piece that comes with each brush to separate the tines. It was not easy to get the bar across the ""combs"" but eventually I managed. There are only two places the bar should be put and that is where the holes are on the back of the ""brush."" I assembled these brushes on the lower holes. My biggest issue with these brushes is that there are only two holes to lock the bar in place when I prefer four holes like my Heeta detangling brush (product number B0836XT7J8 since the Amazon embedded links are not working).<br /><br />Once this is assembled, it glides through the hair and detangles. It works well on dry hair but even better on wet hair. I love the hard tines as it is like getting a massage on the scalp. The handle provides an okay grip but I would have preferred a silicone grip. Since the combs are separated, this brush can act as a vent brush for blow drying even though it is not of circular design. Hair can be removed easily since the tines are flat with no ""ball"" tip.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this three stars is because of the hard time I had assembling the rod in place on each one, the lack of four holes for a secure fit, and the lack of silicone grip on the handle. Otherwise they work well.

Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.",[],B07VGBBNTH,B07VGBBNTH,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1581997877865,0,False
4.0,Versatile set of four combs that look and feel like plastic,"This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q1-gBqO6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q1-gBqO6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q1-gBqO6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B081ZN3TD5,B081ZN3TD5,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1581257263753,0,False
4.0,Nine cloth-covered headbands in muted 60’s type colors/styles,"These headbands remind of Woodstock and the 60's. They are headbands the flower children would wear. The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PwR8S+ZbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PwR8S+ZbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PwR8S+ZbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816zl2Um6RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816zl2Um6RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816zl2Um6RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0837K9W6P,B0837K9W6P,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1580949934338,0,False
4.0,Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible,"I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GGYCwmJVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GGYCwmJVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GGYCwmJVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N8T2rvOeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N8T2rvOeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61N8T2rvOeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hJlaUqrxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hJlaUqrxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hJlaUqrxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07LCHCD6Q,B07LCHCD6Q,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1556243557316,1,False
5.0,"These sponges are great for blending & highlighting, particularly with creams","I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders.

4.0,Vibrant mostly shimmery colors more for women with a darker complexion,"I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the ""compact pallet holder"" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wYkEnFYuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wYkEnFYuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wYkEnFYuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07DSC4X3K,B07DSC4X3K,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1545955740686,0,False
3.0,This flat iron gave me mild straightening results; plates have too much space between them,"[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve. There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kcLpmaAbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kcLpmaAbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kcLpmaAbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07DPKZPRH,B07DPKZPRH,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1545265199508,0,False
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy, cosmetic bag that has limited hanging options and is not worth consideration in my opinion","I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.",[],B073WQHFXB,B073WQHFXB,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1533246198393,2,False

4.0,LumaRx facial cleaning brush is like a Sonicare ElectricToothbrush for the face,"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",[],B01BEYRHBA,B01BEYRHBA,AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,1457053429000,1,False

5.0,Made an impressionable impact.. great for teen boys!,"This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it’s High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2” due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we’re on the 25th day of Geologie’s 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I’m most impressed with- this hasn’t caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I’m sure it’s bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I’m not even sure how it does it, maybe it’s witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son’s for past x3 months and I’m actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn’t have a feminine vibe, nothing “fu-fu-“ to turn teen boys away from using “girl stuff!” Trust me, I’ve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can’t promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I’m so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need..

5.0,Works on every level...,"So, for a man who thinks his looks strike a resemblance to that of Anderson Cooper.. (bc, of the devilishly handsome silver fox short crew cut) mixed with a longer (3/4”) faux-hawk frontal vibe.. this is a great product to work with this style as it complements the cut really well! As one who’s always used hair gel (daily x30+ yrs!) it’s hard to find one we have not tried. Bold Men casual- sold just under $20 for 3.3oz. Is a higher price point so, the expectations were high and happy to say, this came through impressively.<br /><br />This gel has an ability to last thru the day without becoming razor sharp quills nor, a crusty-crumbly flake after a full day of wear in tear. Being one who prefers a touchable hold (the hardest combo to find btw!!) this gives that to you.. We found, unlike cheaper store bought brands- less is more! (too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you’re norm is the “frozen gel look!” Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It’s feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear… It’s just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we’ve used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we’ve noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it’s not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel.. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DJj1cKAwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DJj1cKAwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DJj1cKAwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n4hQYnZaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n4hQYnZaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n4hQYnZaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08JP74M51,B08JP74M51,AEIPJBAN7A55Q5DFFPZSR2UV3OKA,1613990926603,0,False
4.0,Perfect for skin + hair on newborns- great ethnic option!!,"This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin. The baby i had ordered this for, has a unique combo- half Icelandic and half African… Creating skin mixture that needs very delicate and natural products that still can provide plenty of moisture. This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia’s baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face… Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!<br /><br />Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care… This has covered both needs in just this one product. I’m certain as this newborn grows we may need to adjust course and add more specific hair care regiment.

5.0,Non-Greasy Shine,"I'm a curly girl. One of the constant struggles with my type of hair is that it may look dull sometimes since it's so dark. This shine spray is like a makeover in a bottle.

5.0,Youth Serum,"One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine.

5.0,"Works Well on Dry, Cracked Heels","I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven’t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It’s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven’t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a “bite” to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don’t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress – my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they’re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It’s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.",[],B082PW35NV,B082PW35NV,AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,1590494584901,2,True
5.0,"Compact, Quiet and Works Well","I selected this little hair remover/shaver for my wife, to replace a trimmer she had simply worn out over time. This trimmer is a bit different than many of the others I have seen of its type which look more like mascara applicators. After one use, my wife is very pleased with it.<br /><br />This trimmer is similar to a rotary shaver that men use to shave (except one head instead of three) and is similar in size to a glue stick. It runs on a single AA battery and is relatively quiet.<br /><br />After figuring out how to use it, my wife trimmed a single hair and was pleased, and then did something that really surprised me – she used it to dry shave her whole leg. It did a surprisingly good job and actually left her leg smooth, but it took a really long time to finish. This is absolutely not the job for which this little trimmer was designed, but apparently it will work in a pinch.<br /><br />Compared to other trimmers she has used, this one is very gentle and when it’s turned on it doesn’t sound like it’s laboring like some of the others do.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little hair trimmer, designed for facial hair.

After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it’s simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too!

I love that the flexible material comes rolled up like tape, and I appreciate that it can be cut and trimmed into custom shapes and sizes. The chosen flesh tone would likely suit many users, so it at least provides a certain degree of modest skin camouflage.<br /><br />The silicone component brightens, hydrates, moisturizes, softens, and repairs damaged skin, so repeated use truly does seem to make a noticeable difference.

4.0,A Nicely Varied Shade of Jade!,"I have tried and tested many rollers and scrapers recently, so I inspected this duo closely.

That being said, it still adequately applies smooth and even pressure to the face with each systematic use!<br /><br />The gua sha scraper exhibits some scattered scuffs and scrapes, and the edges and “v” angle have some rough, white areas they don’t look perfectly polished, but all natural stones have imperfections to some degree.

Each headband is lightweight, adorably designed, and universally sized, and the elastic portions along the back feel reliable and secure.

4.0,What a “Cheeky” Product! 🍑,"I can honestly say that this was the first time I’ve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I’m always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they’d be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you’re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn’t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I’m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I’m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it’s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it’s worth giving these a try!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91qZVfcc8DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91qZVfcc8DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91qZVfcc8DL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09BR43CS5,B09BR43CS5,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,1631396333149,3,False
5.0,Tea Tree Cleanliness That’s Perfectly Sized! 🌳,"This hand soap provides an effective and hygienic sense of all-natural clean! While I don’t readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that’s been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn’t have any product leak out during shipment. There’s also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle’s base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall! It rinses away cleanly and leaves my family’s hands feeling nice and soft every time.

I love the super slick, shiny surface of this heart-shaped piece, and it’s always cool to the touch at room temperature. It’s comfortable to hold, has a very slim profile, and it always immediately provides a relaxing sense of rebalanced alignment. This gua sha tool also comes with a pink polishing cloth and a red leather storage pouch! The snap is secure and reliable, the stitching is straight, and the scraper device fits snugly inside.

4.0,Pearlescent Purple Pretties! Backing Cards Bent,"These do make affordably unique party favor gifts! The holographic print diamond ring designs are pretty, and I think the featured wording is memorable and cute! I will say that these hair coils are slightly larger than several others I’ve tried, so they don’t seem to be as tight and stretchy as the ones I’m generally used to, but they do make a nice “ring” design for the card, and the iridescent shade of purple is really attractive. Since they all come squashed together in a plastic bag with a slide zipper, they do move around and bend a lot. Because of that, 3 of the 7 decorative backing cards I received had obvious crinkles and bends across one bottom corner. They did flatten back out for the most part, but I still wish I’d received an entire set of pristine cards that were undamaged. They’d make great gifts for bachelorette parties or bridal shower events!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81M7Bfn8qDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81M7Bfn8qDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81M7Bfn8qDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XAR7K4QUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XAR7K4QUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XAR7K4QUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-w7fsyR5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-w7fsyR5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91-w7fsyR5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B098HXPSV3,B098HXPSV3,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,1629669965200,0,False
5.0,"Soft, Lightweight, Nice to Have on Hand! 🛁","This ivory-colored bath mitt comes packaged in a resealable pink pouch, and it’s super lightweight! The packaging says it is 100% natural silk, but it does look and feel more like a linen/cotton fabric. Regardless, it’s soft enough to be gentle, but just textured enough to provide some noticeable friction for exfoliation! It fits comfortably over my hand, and it’s simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I’ve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I’d recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I’d realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I’m pleased with its overall performance!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91o00X0cDdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91o00X0cDdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91o00X0cDdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B099NQM7MF,B099NQM7MF,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,1629054964948,0,False

This lotion has a pleasant scent, and it seems to work great with overnight applications. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized the next morning, and it has even helped diminish the appearance of minor blemishes over time.

5.0,Pale Pink Perfection! 🌸,"I love this skincare set! The pale pink rose quartz hue is such a pretty shade, and the paired duo arrives safely nestled within a cushioned pillow of foam cutouts. The dual-ended roller exhibits smooth and silent movement, and the gua sha stone is perfectly sized and comfortable to hold!

5.0,"Each Portable Pouch Contains a Clear, Floral-Scented Gel!","The blend of royal jelly, botanical, and floral extracts gives this Korean beauty essence a nice ingredient profile, and the overall scent is pleasingly fresh and sweet. Each of the pouches has a small twist-off cap and the liquid contents are clear (and seem to have a high water content). The spread solution initially dries a little stickier than I’d prefer it to (stickier than a well-absorbed moisturizing lotion would), but the eventual result feels hydrating overall.

4.0,The Fabric Tends to Ripple Somewhat,"These nipple covers aren't perfect in every way, but they do offer some reassuring coverage! I do like that they come in 2 different shapes, and I like that they’re super lightweight and easily portable. The satin coverings are soft and smooth, and the light beige hue is an acceptable shade that would complement several skin tones. I will say that the paper backings don’t peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don’t stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I’d have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I’ve had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.",[],B08JJC9594,B08JJC9594,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,1623701272153,0,False
5.0,Hydrating and Delightfully Scented Bits of Eye Gold! 🤩,"This boxed set of smooth, golden eye mask pairs is totally fabulous! Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I’ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I’ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I’m thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn’t be more pleased with this product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91uZe5QV7AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91uZe5QV7AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91uZe5QV7AL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B093YZRFLW,B093YZRFLW,AFTLUVGQWKW6XSQ5TB6UER5Q263A,1623105219553,0,False

5.0,Delightful Set of Rose Quartz Rollers!! 💞,"This is a beautiful and affordably priced facial set! The Brazilian rose quartz stones are a pale shade of pearlescent pink, and the rose gold hardware is the perfect complement to them! The rollers move silently, as promised, and they don’t seem to rust or wear out in any way. The stones are cool to the touch at room temperature, but placing them in the refrigerator (before use) ensures an ultra-chilled experience. I love that the magnetic box lid has instructions printed on the underneath side, and the soft, drawstring pouch is an added bonus! The set even comes with a informational mineral card that provides reassuring details about the quartz pieces featured. Each tool is perfectly nestled within in its own compartmentalized cutout, and the rollers definitely seem to help increase circulation and boost overall skin radiance!

Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo).

It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable.

5.0,High Quality Product That Delivers High Quality Results,"""Best shave I've ever had.  Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor"".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.  Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.  The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Highly recommended",[],B0932Z1NM1,B0932Z1NM1,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1630609578211,0,False
4.0,Deeply and Gently Cleans Pores,"I love how easily and quickly  Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser becomes a creamy lather that feels really nice on my face.  A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot. Does a great job, even with drying my skin a bit.  The price is reasonable. This is a cleanser I will continue to use and I recommend it.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5 stars.",[],B08SVXBVBW,B08SVXBVBW,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1630284777853,0,False

I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!",[],B08SG2MBRY,B08SG2MBRY,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1621575250672,1,False

The compact size makes it perfect for travel, to keep in a purse, a school/gym locker, briefcase or even a pocket.  If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!

5.0,Pamper Yourself...,"Thanks to dry, sensitive skin, I'm always a bit concerned when trying new skin care products. With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!  I will continue to use/purchase Huxley, I'm that satisfied/impressed with what it does for my skin.

5.0,Fantastic Cream!,"I take Melatonin to help me sleep just about every night.  I had NO CLUE melatonin helps improve skin condition as well!  I have very positive results when I take it to help me sleep. I'm guessing it plays a role in why I experience  great results with MU TENUTO Bereceuse Water Gel cream as well! I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!",[],B08LFYMGS5,B08LFYMGS5,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1611548309557,0,False

5.0,I LOVE What Easydew Does For My Skin!,"Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!",[],B07YS9W97B,B07YS9W97B,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1610765636781,0,False
5.0,SO Many Uses For Both Oils! I LOVE Them!,"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kq3NvQnHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kq3NvQnHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kq3NvQnHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08LYT4Q2X,B08LYT4Q2X,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1607202914733,4,False
2.0,Not The Right Mud Mask For Me,"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays.

Same for puffy eyes. FRLEDM's 24K gold under eyes patches help tackle both issues and do so quickly. I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.  I will continue to use the patches and definitely recommend them. I hate to say that I don't recommend the roller just because I don't like the way it feels so I will just say  its not for me.",[],B08M3C6LVS,B08M3C6LVS,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1605613110667,0,False
4.0,"Good Results, Good Men's Lotion",My husband has dry skin that is worsening now that cold weather has arrived and the heat is on in the house on pretty much a regular basis.  I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'.  He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.  He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.

5.0,"Softens, Smooths and Soothes Skin","I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful",[],B08BB3P4VQ,B08BB3P4VQ,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1601706559533,0,False
3.0,Same Results as Dunking in a Bowl of Water,"If you're a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8""tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog's paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn't thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn't really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won't see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn't enough to clean Mac's muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don't see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don't see a  difference.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RrqYnYwuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RrqYnYwuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41RrqYnYwuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aiilnncnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aiilnncnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aiilnncnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41qnTi485gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41qnTi485gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41qnTi485gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yV8NjAVmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yV8NjAVmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yV8NjAVmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OLAHxNysL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OLAHxNysL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OLAHxNysL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08DYFZMGJ,B08DYFZMGJ,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1601115486588,7,False
5.0,Follain  Does What It Promises To Do,"You know the saying 'kill two birds with one stone'? That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41I9K+HFXsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41I9K+HFXsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41I9K+HFXsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eYjxX+WLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eYjxX+WLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eYjxX+WLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41reyYVxf9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41reyYVxf9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41reyYVxf9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08CL46XNM,B08CL46XNM,AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,1599947601009,0,False

5.0,Never Knew My Feet Could Be So Soft!,"My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment!

5.0,Took Care of My Brassy Hair the First Time I Used It!,"A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I'd tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I""m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.

The pic attached is how the hair looks after wetting and detangling also before wetting. I would suggest order longer lengths so you can finger comb instead of actually having to brush the kinks out with the shorter length. It was cute while it lasted though.

It's also great that I can wear my favorite eyelashes that normally require glue with this eyeliner without the need of glue. The eyelashes included in the kit are a good everyday eyelash. I also like that I can purchase their eyeliner separately if I want instead of having to buy the kit again. I've worn these lashes all day and even slept in them a night or two just to see how well they'd hold up. They held up amazingly. I've purchased an additional black and clear eyeliner to go with my kit. I prefer these over the magnetic eyeliner with magnetic lashes because it concerns me that the magnetic eyeliner may be found to have adverse effects at some point. Oh, additionally, this eyeliner goes on so well as a good as the adhesive works with the lashes it doesn't have a tacky feeling on your eye.

4.0,An Inexpensive Way to Whiter Teeth,"Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.",[],B000067E30,B000067E30,AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,1146326778000,15,False

Why any manufacturer would use it in this day and age baffles me. Unless it was about planned obsolescence all along.

3.0,Not For Lefties.,"The brush is really nice, good craftsmanship with a thick substantial handle.  It deserves to be loved, but only if you're right-handed.  The way the bristles are angled makes the brush upside-down in a left hand.  Sure, you can use the long bristles, but that defeats the purpose of the angle which really does make the brush go through whiskers more easily.  We Southpaws are very used to this.  So many products designed to fit in a hand are made for the right hand, which makes them awkward or ineffective (like scissors) for 10% of us.  When that happens, I find that I don't reach for that item as often, or I avoid it altogether, and, sadly, this fine brush sits seldom-used in my bathroom.  Maybe some future version could have the peak of the bristles in the middle with an angle on both sides.

2.0,Robot in disguise?,"At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as ""Frenzy"" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007",[],B000PKKAGO,B000PKKAGO,AGTMZCWIWBH43TCW7UKG2YV2EKKA,1197914295000,8,False

3.0,The color is way off from the description,"I wanted to try the breathable nail polish. I prefer frosts or pearls, and pinks. My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I've already opened it, I can't return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is ""Pinky Promise"", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to ""Purple Promise"", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the ""breathable"" polish, as I'd never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live. It's like the 1950's). However, I wanted to test the polish, so wore my usual glove on my right hand, and no glove on the left.<br />Water, for prolonged time, is this polish's kryptonite! I added a photo. All the polish came off the ends when my nails got super wet and soft.<br />But I will say the polish lasted much longer than my usual brand (Hansens).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+qw48hplL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+qw48hplL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+qw48hplL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61J5QpMVCuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61J5QpMVCuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61J5QpMVCuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k-lsV-n1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k-lsV-n1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61k-lsV-n1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qvzo5ErnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qvzo5ErnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qvzo5ErnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uwmhWEAjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uwmhWEAjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uwmhWEAjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09TWWRFP9,B09TWWRFP9,AFTEMMCIMU62ONZHLLXEXSME4Z6Q,1653936169380,6,True

I find that this has light natural coverage using a foundation brush. It tones down my redness with ease. It can be built up, especially if allowed to semi dry between applications.

5.0,"nice formula, feels good, absorbs well, effective. This is my 2nd container. Love GoMay","I have used this before! I had used several GoMay products about a two years ago. I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring. Can't quite put my finger on the aroma. It dissipates quickly, and it is really faint. Like green tea and plain yogurt.<br /><br />--The cream absorbs quickly. It just soaks right into my skin. I have skin that leans dry, and I do follow up with either a hydrating sunscreen, or if used at night I add a thicker emollient.

5.0,"lasts all day, removes easily, actually lengthens, doesnt irritate my eyes, budget friendly option","When the times comes to wash my face, this mascara comes off extra easy. I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price.

5.0,"highly versatile, well made, effective shower cap. Fits my large head, and all my hair","An adorable shower cap that fits my large head. It says it fits up to 24"" head, and mine measures 23.5"". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this.

5.0,"excellent coverage, non cakey, doesnt settle into lines, a tad warm for fair, cool skin","Primer, liquid Foundation, BB cushion, and a flat kabuki brush. I have another Phoera kit, and I like it a lot.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093GFPFP9<br /><br />I am not sure if Nude (#102) is the lightest shade they have or not, but if you are like me and have fair skin with cool undertones this may lean a little warm. It isn't bad, but if they had a better match available I would want to get that.<br />THEY DO!! this is for fair with pink undertones<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZ6QZLJ/<br /><br />The BB cushion is a tad lighter, and a better match for my skin. I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try. I wasn't even going to try this, but since they provided so much information in their product description it really piqued my interest.

4.0,"creamy semi matte finish, bold, bright pop of color, fades w/ drink & food, smudges","Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word ""matte"" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all.

5.0,"surprisingly very nice gift assortment, well packaged, definitely gift worthy","Smells SO Good!!!  I'll add in some pics as the product pictures shown here dont do this justice. The contents are in a sturdy flip top box makes it look like a gift (and was shipped in a regular box, maintaining integrity of the product box). Almost reminds me of a subscription box as the deign on the outside gives it a special look. It kinda threw me off because I nearly expected more of a generic look. I thought, ooh did someone send me something? lol. But no, I ordered this lol<br /> Once I opened the box, a colorful, glossy card stock card with the phrase, ""Happy Birthday to You"" on one side, and totally blank on the other. This sits on top of dense, well packed brown paper grass. Each product is carefully nestled underneath. The products look good and they smell good. Really good-- not cloying and cheap. Just pleasant. The entire unboxing experience was pleasant, and I would totally buy this for someone. You know how some gift compilations look cheap? This has a classy, artsy look that I would be proud to give to someone.<br /><br />This will probably be my go to gift item for anyone who enjoys these sorts of products. Set comes with lip balm, a bath bomb, a scrub, a cream, a bar of soap, and a soy candle. I'll use everything.

I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion).

I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there.

5.0,"travel sized bottle will provide many applications, works well, even better as day goes on","It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for ""light hair"". It is a pale yellow powder. ""This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‘poo is for you"". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it.

5.0,"very light, absorbs well, works well alone or over other skin care products","My skin is dry, totally clear (no acne) save for some redness & visible veins from Type 1 rosacea. This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up.

5.0,"This is a gommage. It is meant to clump/form bits. Apply to dry face, massage, rinse. SOFTNESS!","This is a gommage!!! The most gentle of all the physical exfoliation out there. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I also highly recommend anything by Easydew. Good stuff!  Know that this is meant to clump! Not supposed to have lather or creaminess. I had looked at the ingredients and some of the description and I suspected a gommage. The directions on box say to use on wet face and that it will lather. It doesn't. There is some clumps, but not as much as if it were used on a dry face, which is what is expected from a gommage. We want glorious clumps! For best results use on a clean dry face, not a wet face. I have tried it both ways, definitely use on dry face. Works but not as good on wet face.<br /><br />So use a generous amount. Just pat it in all over. Let it sit a moment, then massage it in in gentle circular motion. As you do so, small clumps will form. This is a combination of product and grime and dead skin cells. Basically, a ""gommage"" is like an eraser on a pencil, and your skin is paper. The graphite marks are dirt and dead skin cells. The product once applied is like that eraser-- it is removing those ""marks"". What happens when you use an erase? You start to see balled up pieces of eraser mixed with the graphite/pencil marks. That is more or less what is happening here. Those balled up pieces are a mix of product, dirt, and cells. Rinse, and carry on with rest of your routine. It is a very gentle ""peel"". And quite effective. But less so when used on wet skin-- the ingredients just can't grab the gunk on face as well. I'm surprised there is such a discrepancy in instructions.<br /><br />Instructions on container:<br />""How to use:<br />Apply desired amount of peeling gel and work into a rich lather by wet hands.<br />Gently cleanse by massaging thoroughly over face in circles, avoiding eye contour.<br />Rinse off with lukewarm water.""<br /><br />But the pictures clearly show what is expected--balled up bits/clumps.<br /><br />SO, it it may be a matter of terminology/language.

My litmus test to a good mascara has been reduced to simply whether it irritates my eyes or not. As for lengthening, lifting, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. This DOES NOT IRRITATE (!!)

My lashes are well coated, making them look thicker, and there is a lift that I greatly appreciate as my lashes otherwise angle downward. Length is notable too. My lashes are nomrally ho-hum.

My bottle was hard to get open, and once I did I could immediately tell that the oil had oxidized. Totally unusable as it was truly rancid. The oil was thick, all cakds up around the topper, and the bulb dropper was rock hard. I was unable to squeeze it. I think the dropper had dry rotted, then that allowed air into the bottle, leading to a rancid product. It was evident not just based on looks, but also that super special aroma of a rancid oil. Too bad, as I love seed oils for use on body, face, and hair. This had to go directly into garbage. Not at all usable as something with anti-oxidants become PRO-oxidant when exposed to air. This is going to do exactly the opposite of what you want. Again, I give benefit of the doubt. I imagine it was a bad bottle and hopefully not at all what anyone should expect.

Not one iota of difference on my lashes.,"I've used fiber lash mascaras before- they usually have a pronounced effect, and is why I wanted to try this Kissio Derol mascara. The thing is, it doesn't do anything for me. I am perplexed. I applied the primer (comb brush with hairs/fibers), then followed up with the bushy brush mascara. And.. nothing. I can not see even a miniscule amount of added volume or length. Not even more than a basic mascara. Initially it had not bothered my sensitive eyes for the first few hours but then my eyes started getting itchy and irritated like they had something in them-- the fibers were falling off into my eyes!

4.0,"glowing glassy skin. NIACINAMIDE (2%), ADENOSINE (.04%) & PEARL EXTRACT","I've only just begun using this, so this is a first impression review. I am fairly familiar with the active ingredients and understand how they work (and that they do work, so I expect this to continue that). The new part is the pearl extract, which has both immediate effect and longer term use benefit. I can attest to the immediacy, and it will be with using this for greater amount of time to determine if it a repurchase or not. As I learn more, I will share more. Here is a break down of what is in it and what to expect:<br /><br />BLANCHET GLAM PEARL RADIANCE CAPSULE SERUM is a supremely light weight gel serum with hint of floral scent from lavender, geranium, rose, and sandalwood. Barely detectable.  A little goes a long way. This weightless serum adds a mild level of healthy sheen. Korean Beauty emphasizes healthy skin, hydrated skin, supple skin, dewy, glowing skin. It is never matte. So while you could cover this with your foundation or powder, KB is all about letting natural skin shine through. The gentle, mild barely there sheen provides more of a glass look than a shiny look. Subtle. As for the rest... The primary active ingredients are NIACINAMIDE (2%) and ADENOSINE (.04%).<br /><br />NIACINAMIDE is a skin care work horse. It provides a variety of benefit to all skin types, ages, and concerns. It is a water-soluble vitamin (B3) that works with the natural substances in your skin to help improve skin barrier, fix past damage, visibly minimize enlarged pores, tighten lax pores, improve uneven skin tone, soften fine lines and wrinkles, diminish dullness, and strengthen a weakened surface. As I hone in on ingredients that pack the greatest punch, niacinamide has stood out as a must have ingredient in my skin care routine. I especially like it for its ability to brighten pigmentation. It also is one of few ingredients that work well with other ingredients without concern for contraindication or nullification. Skin care can get tricky, and this ingredient is just so easy to work with- so go ahead and use it with retinol, peptides, acids, etc. Niacinamide simply helps skin be healthy and look healthy and radiant. As with most skin care, it can take several weeks to several months of consistent use to see changes. This serum will help over time, but other ingredients provide an instant radiant glow.<br /><br />ADENOSINE is a rising star in anti aging products. There are studies that demonstrate that adenosine is an effective ingredient for improving the appearance of wrinkles, in both the eye and mouth area. Interestingly, adenosine directly affects the production of type I and type III collagen in the skin by binding to A2A receptors in fibroblast cells. So if it can help boost (or at least maintain) collagen, and help collagen from breaking down (collagen is what keeps our skin plump. Compare your 45 year old face to your 18 year old face, if your face now looks ""thinner"" despite no losing weight, it is the decrease of collagen that has produced that look). Since adenosine has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen, applying it topically can help to prevent (and somewhat even reverse) wrinkles. *thumbs up*<br /><br />80% FERMENTED PEARL EXTRACT is rich in amino acids and trace minerals that are highly moisturizing, soothing, and brightening. I must say, this is something that is new to me. Before this product, I had no idea that there was a use for pearl extract. It is used in topical skin care products as well as for use internally. I really dont know much about any of this, but a cursory search led me to a few interesting bullet points:<br />-Increases skin's collagen production<br />-Helps repair skin's damaged cells<br />-Lightens skin's tone and improves blemishes<br />-Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles<br />-Controls oil and shine<br />-Reduces pores and promotes smoother skin<br />-It has soft hues which shift subtly from direct to side views<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />Skin Brightening<br />Anti wrinkle<br /><br />Uses<br />High-intensity brightening lotion with 80% of fermented pearl extract in capsule technology<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />ACTIVE:Niacinamide,Adenosine<br />INACTIVE: water, dipropylene,  Glycol,1,2-Hexanediol,Agar,Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Synthetic Fluorphlogopite,Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891),Polyglyceryl-10Laurate,Polyglyceryl-10Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin,Hydrolyzed Pearl,Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Oil,Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,Glycerin,Propanediol Hydroxyacetophenone,1,2-Hexanediol ,Centella Asiatica Extract,Butylene Glycol,Propanediol ,Portulaca Oleracea Extract,1,2-Hexanediol Centella Asiatica Extract,1,2-Hexanediol ,Panax Ginseng Leaf/Stem Extract Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract,1,2-Hexanediol , Hydrolyzed corn starch Beta vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract,Glycerin,Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glutathione,Plankton extract,Disodium EDTA,Tromethamine Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Xanthan Gum","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1AoVenMIwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1AoVenMIwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1AoVenMIwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1PhwOU4+4S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1PhwOU4+4S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1PhwOU4+4S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1dcm+m3uDS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1dcm+m3uDS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1dcm+m3uDS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08D7TLV21,B08D7TLV21,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1614614689120,0,False

4.0,"excellent ingredients, could use more packaging info, works well w/ shamp & conditioner","I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot- leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy looking. I added in this serum as I hoped to gain hair density or at least reduce loss (or reduce cycle frequency and/or duration). I dont have trouble growing my hair, I have trouble keeping it. So my hair is long, but much less dense than previous years. I transitioned from minoxidil to this. I wont do that again, as any gains I got from minoxidil were lost-- and I do contribute some of that to not using this as consistently as I did that. I'll explain what went into that below. This serum helped the condition of my hair and scalp, so I think it works well with minoxidil instead of in lieu of it. I likely wont continue with the serum for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. there was no instruction as to how to use this product. It is a dropper bottle, and I pretty much just used it like I did with minoxidil-- massaged whatever I pulled with dropper and distributed all over scalp, primarily at crown. Was this the correct way to do it? no idea. *<br /><br />2. It does say to apply to clean hair. Well, many of us do not wash our hair every single day. I have long curly hair that leans dry and there is no need to wash it daily. So I am either applying this to unwashed scalp daily or it only gets applied a few times a week.  Hence the lack of consistency. So right here it eliminates some would-be users if it has to be on a fresh washed scalp.<br /><br />3. the dropper is uncomfortable. I do not want to drop it from the dropper. I want to run it across the scalp so as to keep it from getting on my hair. The dropper is a little sharp feeling (at least my bottle that I received). I like the dropper style, and my thought is that if I were to buy this again, I would use a dropper from an old minoxidil bottle instead.<br /><br />4. How long should this bottle last? Since I had no idea how much I should use, I often wondered if I used too much or too little. Any new hair treatment needs to be given 4-6 months of consistent use to see results, if any. I know the shampoo and conditioner helped, and this serum has great ingredients that will help existing hair and scalp health.. but the inconsistency on my part from lack of instructions as well as expectation of using on fresh washed hair made it impossible to see if I could get benefit from it.<br /><br /> * ""It is best applied to damp hair after showering. We recommend visually splitting your scalp into 4 sections/quadrants. Depending on the amount of hair, use around 3-5 drops per quadrant. I like to drop into fingers and work into scalp. The remaining amount on your fingers you can work through your hair. It is perfectly fine to use the serum many times a day. That being said, it is important that the scalp/hair is clean"" (--I saw this written in the community question section of this page. Including this on box or in a leaflet would have been greatly helpful)<br /><br />The ingredients are of quality, the products work well together. I have since gone back to minoxidil, and once I have stopped the current shedding phase, I may buy another bottle to use as a support product. For that, I give it 4 stars.",[],B07DS4GPGX,B07DS4GPGX,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1612643175027,2,True
4.0,"TRY THIS! test on FACE for match not hands, evens out skin tone, not for dry skin","I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br /><br />Overall, it isn't for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

This Repair Control Renewal lotion always feels so good on my skin. I love it for my simple skin days. It has so much going for it-- addresses a multitude of concerns- and is gentle. It is one of those lotions that just make the skin look and feel good immediately. If you have dry skin, their toner is pretty great too.<br /><br />My skin: 40 something, dry skin. Clear (no acne, minimal lines) but with type 1 Rosacea (redness & visible veins/telangiectasias).<br /><br />My typical routine:<br />morning: wash face, apply hydrating toner (sometimes use 7 skins method), serum, moisturizer, SPF (I ALWAYS use SPF, that is my #1 skin care product)<br />night: double cleanse (1st oil based wash, then water based wash), hydrating toner (often 7 skins method), serum/actives, moisturizer and/or moisturizing overnight ""mask"" or occlusive.",[],B01N7A5AGF,B01N7A5AGF,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1612028228543,0,False
5.0,"hydrating gentle creamy foam, cleanses & rinses well, includes EGF for skin repair","Easydew is skin care that is functional, effective, and always seems to live up to the expectations. I happen to like EGF (epidemal growth factors), and if you don't then just don't purchase Easydew DW-EGF products. I recommend doing a quick search to learn more about ""EGF in skin care"". I've been a fan for awhile now, so I was stoked to try this face wash. I use other Easydew products with success.<br /><br />My 40 something dry skin benefits from the gentle, hydrating cleansing. It has some creamy lather, kinda foamy, feels nice to massage in, and rinses clean. Skin feels good. Not taut.<br /><br />Dont need much. First couple of times I squeezed out what I was used to using with some other cleansers. This is thick, and once you add in a little warm water it takes off with lather. If you end up not loving it for your face, it would make for a fabulous shaving cream and/or body wash. This tube will last a long while no matter what you use it for.<br /><br />I use a two step cleansing process most nights of the week. So that means starting off with an oil cleanser to help dissolve stubborn grime and products (primarily my SPF, but make up too), then using a gentle water based cleanser to actually wash away was was broken up and left behind.

5.0,"excellent at evening out rosy skin, great smelling tinted mineral sunscreen, great as primer","Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin. Not sure what I am feeling. Its odd.. but it doesnt impact overall look, feel, or performance.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A10XI7vvB0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A10XI7vvB0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A10XI7vvB0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1tkEmoILpS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1tkEmoILpS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1tkEmoILpS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06ZYWVSZY,B06ZYWVSZY,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1610729944227,0,False

I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash.

5.0,"Softest hands ever, lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil, lemon oil, orange oil, rosemary","I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.<br /><br />One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down.

5.0,"Aromatic bars of ""Soap Shields"" that gently scrub & cleanse","These small bars of soap smell really good and perform well in terms of cleansing and not leaving skin feeling stripped. I like that they are made in USA, handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small, but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well.

Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far.

3.0,"weightless, non tacky, fully absorbs quickly, NO added fragrance, no scent","I have Rosacea, specifically type 1 where I experience redness from flushing and visible veins (telangiectasias). Otherwise clear skin. While topicals won't really help the veins, I can use products that help even out skin tone where it is pink from flushing. Some products can initially make my skin red, then it calms down (especially if new). This ISNTREE Cica Relief Ampoule Duo Set has not irritated my skin. In fact, it has helped to minimize aggravated skin.<br /><br />The serum is extremely light. I think the lightest weight product I have ever used. The bottles are small, and I feel like I am going through it quickly. I may be using too much, I dont know. I  do apply to neck and chest as well as face. I already use a product with EGF (epidermal growth factor), and I thought that maybe in serum form it would feel like a more concentrated dose. I have no idea how much Isntree uses, but this product feels like the emphasis is on the Centella Asiatica Extract. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I am just not sure yet what I think about the performance of this product for my skin.  The two small bottles would be better as 1 bottle.<br /><br />--super light weight<br />--absorbs instantly<br />--not tacky<br />--skin feels instantly smooth (I also use some on the back of my hands)<br />--I wouldn't use it alone as a moisturizer, especially if have dry skin (like me)<br />--gentle, doesn't aggravate my skin, but that very well could differ for everyone (esp those w/ damaged skin barrier)<br />--contains soothing centella asiatica extract<br />--contains EGF- worth doing some research to see the benefits and to discount myths.<br />--ingredients that can help build and maintain skin barrier. Especially important for those with skin conditions where they are exacerbated by a damaged skin barrier.

I cant detect any aroma.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, smooth and clear (except for visible veins), leans dry.

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product.

There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products, and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.<br /><br />1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications?

3.0,"just like mousse or shaving cream, but is a soap for body","The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body.  Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, ""These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment"".  I'm not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it's up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn't quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains ""parfum (fragrance)"" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.

3.0,"dry soft granular ""scrub""/mask, just add water/hydrosol. Directions for use on Face","This Juicy Chemistry face & body scrub is a very mild, and seemingly gentle ""scrub"" chock full of great ingredients. For rating, I am right in the middle of neither really liking it nor really disliking it (ok, maybe leaning a more toward dislike for me). The ""3 stars"" include the fact the company (and their ingredient selections) seems of high quality and may be worthwhile to check out.<br /><br />I have mixed thoughts on this, so please bear with me as I try to explain.<br /><br />At first glance, the small container is packed to the brim with a dark brown, dry, granular looking substance. This is primarily a combo of coffee powder and cocoa powder. I thought it was going to be a rough scrub, and immediately thought that there is no way I would use that on my face. Since it says, ""for face AND body"" my plan changed  to use it on my body in the shower. However, the directions say to apply TO FACE, and allow to sit for 10 minutes/until dry. That isn't happening as a body scrub. In the shower.<br /><br />So now I am back to trying it on my face. It did not come with a spatula or spoon, so plan to use your own. Or scoop out with a finger.I have tried it by spooning out a bit of product and adding water, adding a hydrosol, and adding an oil. The latter makes it easiest to use through I do not know if it impeded the other ingredients. Also, it wouldn't dry with oil. But it did stay in place with oil.<br /><br />Any granular feeling quickly melted down, so I felt better about using it on my face. But still, not a fan of anything granular on face. Overall, I don't like it for my face- I only tried it once because that is all I could handle. . It felt like it left some powder behind. I felt compelled to rewash my face to get any remnants off. Meh.<br /><br />Body is fine (and is why I selected it for use). When used with all bases I mentioned, the result was a slightly oily feel. Not heavy, not greasy. Definitely a little bit of hydration/moisture. Ultimately not a fan of it for my face, but do like it enough for use on body. HOWEVER, I do not ""keep it on until it dries"" while I am using it.. in the shower. I just use it like a regular body scrub. I either add water to it, or oil. OR use a basic creamy body wash as the vehicle. Now that I think of it, even a body lotion would work (especially if you have one you dont love and want to use up). Once again, the oil (or body wash/ lotion) is easier to worth- I can work it all over body, massage it in, and as it rinses away once again that slightly oily feel is left behind (not greasy, not heavy, rather soft and light; rather nice).  Make sure to rinse shower as this will splatter brown all over.<br /><br />I like that the product is packed into a small jar container, and that it needs a base (water, hydrosol, etc) which can be good or bad depending on your preference. By needing to add your own, the product is more concentrated (not paying for added water,etc), but it lends just a tiny bit of inconvenience. Use in the shower is awkward. Use as a scrub mask is going to come down to preference. If you like a more granular feeling physical scrub/exfoliator this may not be for you. If you use more, you may get more of a scrub feel (I guess you could add sugar). I use less as I do not want a harsh physical scrub. For the shower, I prefer a greater scrub feel, so I use more. I am thinking now I may add this to another jar, add some cream or oil, and some added sugar for an easier to use shower scrub experience.<br /><br />Packaging is nice, and pleasant to look at.

I like my body lotions to be on the thin side as I find it easier/quicker to apply as well as quicker to absorb. When I have extra rough spots, then I don't mind using a thicker emollient. But for just out of the shower lotion to lock in moisture.. I want a thinner lotion. This provides that. Yet, it is moisturizing enough to use any other time of day. Leave at kitchen sink for hand moisturizing as needed is great too. But not at bathroom sink lest someone mistakes it for toothpaste, haha. It is in a toothpaste style container. Just flip cap and squeeze.<br /><br />It feels nice on skin, has no added fragrance. I like their 1513 face lotion and I like this hand/body lotion too. I tend to have dry skin, so I find both are better for me for summer or days I just a light hydration boost. Easy to use, no frills lotion that is gentle on skin.

So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier. Maybe over time? I am thinking this might be good for dehydrated oily skin, or normal to lightly dry skin. I am just guessing.<br /><br />I would use it to hold in other hydrating products like a thin mask. Or MAYBE on days when I just want something on and I don't want to fuss.<br /><br />Unexpectedly great for hands. Immediate softness. The backs of my hands feel super wonderful after applying this. The pump container makes it easy to dole out on the go. Would be great for keeping in a purse.<br /><br />Since it is thin but rich as well as the ease of application makes it REALLY nice as a neck and chest cream. If this formula is supposed to increase skin oil over time, then having that added advantage applied to the neck (naturally not oil area) could be a game changer for those concerned with skin on the neck.<br /><br />I think it is lovely, overall. 4 stars",[],B08C37KWRR,B08C37KWRR,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1601744886228,1,False

The cloth, once wet becomes crazy sudsy. It has a barely there scent. I really have to sniff to be able to detect anything. Very fresh.  The lather is gentle and non drying. I was surprised that my face was not feeling parched or taut afterward.<br /><br />Not only for face, but it makes for a decent cleansing cloth to have a ""bird bath"" at the sink. Just wipe down everywhere you need to, rinse the cloth, rinse your body, rinse the cloth again, ring it out, use it to pat down the body.. and away you go.<br /><br />I think one could get away with using half a cloth easily for just face washing as there is plenty of cleaning agent in it.<br /><br />Overall it is a lovely product. I think it is perfectly packaged for occasional use, or for on the go/ travel. If I were to use it all the time, I would prefer something with less packaging. Maybe they have that...

Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference.

I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff.

I used to have incredibly crazy thick hair and over the past 10 years or so, it has greatly reduced. My hair grows fine (it is nearly waist length) but the hairs are thinner, and the overall volume on my scalp has reduced. While we all naturally shed, the amount that comes out when I am in a shedding cycle is depressing. I hope to reduce the frequency and amount of loss. SO, I am taking supplements, starting some new DHT blocking shampoo and conditioner, adding in a scalp treatment.. etc. This supplement is all together different than what I have been taking, so I am extra hopeful for its effectiveness. It am currently either in an ""off shedding cycle"", or my approach is working. I don't want to claim yet that this is working as I think the benchmark for noted improvement is 3 weeks.

5.0,"excellent sunscreen with skin loving ingredients, broad spectrum, great little container","The ""Drop the Bomb"" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: ""Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine""! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won't even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn't grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my ""reapply"" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn't even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn't really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-kiBJ+cyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-kiBJ+cyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-kiBJ+cyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FxPcV1BxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FxPcV1BxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FxPcV1BxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uQh+6sQcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uQh+6sQcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uQh+6sQcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kVZ4yBuBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kVZ4yBuBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kVZ4yBuBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RGZNDV4,B07RGZNDV4,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1596938837662,0,False
5.0,clean brushes every time,"First one I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea.

4.0,"like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash; zero eye irritation, easy to wash off","I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, ""made for USA but made in China"", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes"", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B2YT4naOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B2YT4naOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B2YT4naOL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TPwDoCKoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TPwDoCKoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TPwDoCKoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TiGPqVg9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TiGPqVg9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TiGPqVg9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g-iEN9beL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g-iEN9beL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g-iEN9beL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71od9LJbhEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71od9LJbhEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71od9LJbhEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qwdOq4WKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qwdOq4WKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qwdOq4WKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yKPnR68NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yKPnR68NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yKPnR68NL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQIOR8M4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQIOR8M4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQIOR8M4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B086SSHLWT,B086SSHLWT,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1595442388136,3,False
4.0,"lightweight, budget friendly, soothing cica cream, use all over","Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.",[],B0859CYSTM,B0859CYSTM,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1593570937241,5,False
5.0,"this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow, absorbs well, hydrates, non greasy","Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, ""medium"" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.",[],B0855L611L,B0855L611L,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1592427032313,5,False
5.0,LOVE! super gentle manual exfoliation & chemical peeling product; deep cleans pores; brightens,"I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth. Softly cleanses skin, non irritating.<br /><br />--Skin soothing: TECA™ formula (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) delivers a soothing benefit to skin; helps create bright skin.

4.0,"scent is too much for me on this one, but there other ones are awesome; great nourishing scrub","This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain ""parfum"" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn't do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn't have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven't had a headache, and I don't actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell. It isn't there, thankfully.<br /><br />I'd boost it to a 5 rating, but the product descriptions says, ""No Artificial Fragrances Or Perfumes"", and ""parfum"" is on ingredient list- and doesn't say where that is derived from.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-kT8fSXDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-kT8fSXDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-kT8fSXDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B076DGMQTM,B076DGMQTM,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1569875262983,5,False

4.0,"sharp, long plade, short handle, slices hair off easily","WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2"". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5"". Many are 1"" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61psmjrNtIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61psmjrNtIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61psmjrNtIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hcDFSrPjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hcDFSrPjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hcDFSrPjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Db5NUnS-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Db5NUnS-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Db5NUnS-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aRShc5vNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aRShc5vNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aRShc5vNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07R3BMYBG,B07R3BMYBG,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1561224373116,6,False

4.0,"easy use, comfortable, could have longer nozzle","I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (""anti-fouling rubber stopper""). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.",[],B07LCHCD6Q,B07LCHCD6Q,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1555785204360,0,False
1.0,deplaner wand= razor handle. Just use a razor,"I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don't want to sound cynical, but I really don't want  you to spend money where you don't have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don't let this more expensive ""deplaning tools"" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, ""WAND"") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, ""deplaning"" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don't fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it ""deplaning"") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn't just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn't great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What's in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, ""deplaning blade"") in each handle (ie; ""wand""). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don't expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The ""wands"" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the ""instructions for use"" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don't like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.",[],B07LBK2YQX,B07LBK2YQX,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1555438600776,24,False
4.0,"not salon straight, but natural straight looking results","It doesn't perfectly straighten the hair, but it definitely smooths it out, getting it pretty close to straight. The crush style straightener is pretty easy to use. It will take a little getting used to over using a flat plate straightener. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use it on my long, thick, wavy hair.. but I had no trouble with it. My first time using it was on not freshly washed hair- maybe a day or two after last shampoo. I used a little thermal protector, and then started swiping the brush through my hair. It took longer than using a flat plate to get hair smoothed out, but I do like the natural looking results. I like the ability to use a fine water mist- this helps to smooth out the hair.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Hx9N7wyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Hx9N7wyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Hx9N7wyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rE4pvbJVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rE4pvbJVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rE4pvbJVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07H2TPSZ8,B07H2TPSZ8,AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,1555270893135,1,True
4.0,cold jade feels good on face,"Jade roller and jade scraper comes in pleasant looking box with a small bag to store these items in. It would make for a nice gift. Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions. It says using this before hand will help the products work better.

What I like about this set it's a spoof of Wayne's World and it comes with a Wayne's World cap, a wig, T shirt and an inflatable guitar. The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.<br />“Wayne's World"" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled ""Wayne's Power Minute"" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon.

Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show ""live"" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30.

Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price.

I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face.

This is a great product to use for those of us that are mindful of our personal hygiene and want to be ready for any situation that comes up between showers.

5.0,Great Resin Decorating Sampler and Tools,"I am happy with my order of the Resin Decorative Accessories Set. This was packaged well and arrived in great condition. What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included.

The accessories have served well and after several months of use are still in good shape. It does great for my nails, but I also use this on my feet. It makes my self-mani and pedis quick and easy. The handle is easy to grip. Speed is quick, but not so much that it's difficult to control. I find that this is a good nail drill for personal use, but I wouldn't recommend it for multiple users as it does start to get warm in my hand when I am finishing on myself.

4.0,Great for Washing Hands,"There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.",[],B09473GGM4,B09473GGM4,AE3X7PNUWXQU6FZQLQGIA6ZT45QA,1626349138206,0,False
3.0,Mixed Feelings,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about the Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit. Primarily, the perm solution is really, really harsh. I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand.

I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold.

5.0,Fantastic Value!,"The Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats.

All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!

This product incorporates the best ingredients known to increase collagen in facial tissue.<br /><br />In addition this Sunrise Serum has lightening agents that work together to smooth and even skin tone.  I was especially interested in this aspect as I have a few sunspots that I want to lighten.  Over the several weeks of using this twice a day I can see that it is gradually lightening them. Obviously, I understand any treatment such as this, requires extended daily use to achieve the results I’m seeking, but based on my initial findings I’m confident it will work.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I absolutely recommend. I look forward to using more Merlot products in the future as I found this serum superb.",[],B07WNBZQGT,B07WNBZQGT,AEP4CUO23WOOOEYSJBXWYLLHD5IQ,1585438138801,0,False

4.0,Practice makes perfect,"My wife has always wanted to try magnetic eyelashes, so she decided to give these a shot. They really do work! But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool.

Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink.

They made sure that it maintains the natural pH of the skin so you are not prone to infections.<br /><br />The fragrance is ok in my eyes and it works well overall. The price is a bit on the more expensive side considering how much product you get, however considering that it is vegan and all, I think it kind of makes up for it.

5.0,Spa treatment at home,This is an interesting product for sure. You get a jar with cream that looks very cute in my eyes but that is not all. You also get a multi-care massage applicator that has red light to treat your skin.<br /><br />The cream itself has a lovely fragrance that I really like. It is creamy yet lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. You can then use the multi-care massage applicator and use it to massage the cream into the skin as a special treat really but it also just works the cream better into the skin. Work the cream from the center to the outside and massage for about 3 minutes. Then make sure to clean the applicator.<br /><br />I have to say this is a special way to apply your cream and makes it more like a spa treatment than anything else and really works quite well. The cream has a lot of good ingredients and together this is fantastic. I for one love this and can only recommend it. When you are out of cream you can just get the refill pack without the massager which is great. The price for this was very reasonable as well. All in all very happy with this and it makes for a fantastic gift!,[],B083BCSQGN,B083BCSQGN,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1627916483206,0,False

This clay mask really cleans my skin beautifully and does not dry it out too much. I have normal skin and it does dry it out a little bit but since I always use a good moisturizer afterwards it is not a big deal.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instruction, clean your face, apply an even layer and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. I let it get pretty dry before I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. My skin felt great and was nice and soft after I used this mask. I for one can only recommend this one.",[],B08L4HTQ3R,B08L4HTQ3R,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1627907216622,0,False

I love using this especially on a hot summer day because it is very refreshing. It is even better yet if you put the cream in the fridge to cool it down, because it feels even more refreshing.<br /><br />This cream absorbs really quickly into the skin. It has a fantastic fragrance of lavender that I am a huge fan of. It is fantastic especially in the evening because it just has a very calming effect on top of the refreshing feel of it. It leaves a slight tack residue on the skin but that goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes, so no big deal. I for one really like this one and it hits every aspect that it should.

The eye patches smell great and are rather soothing to be honest. However I have to say paying $24, much cheaper than their green tea version.<br /><br />These work quite nicely and I do really like them. I do like how soothing these are and use them when my under eye area is puffy or is very dark and seems like I have been put through the ringer. These feel even better if you keep them in the fridge, they then have an even more cooling effect.<br /><br />All in all I do really like them, so I will get these instead of their green tea ones from now on.",[],B08KWN77LW,B08KWN77LW,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1623767406253,0,False

I am not prone to reactions to these kinds of products and didn't have any in this case either.<br /><br />I found this was a great moisturizer and my skin looked soft and smooth overall.

It is very easy to use and I have to say seeing on the phone what was happening was neat. The blackhead remove is very easy to use, similar to the one I already have really. It has different sized heads that allow you to change the pressure that you are applying. The power button turns it on and off but also changes the modes from soft to normal to strong.<br /><br />Make sure you keep it moving or the vacuum can actually cause damage, meaning break some capillaries which will cause a bruise. This will obviously heal but who wants a bruise in the face?<br /><br />I really like this because you can really see what is going on up close. It is easy to use and works well.

My hair is quite long these days and when you have longer hair it gets a little bit more complicated I found. So I wanted to give this one a chance and see how it goes. There is definitely a slight learning curve but watch the video and off you go.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is at the handle and is very easy to use by rotating it. The tip is insulated so you can actually touch it which is a nice added touch in my eyes. There is also an adjustment that lets you switch if it turns left or right when making the curls so you can switch that as well depending on which way you want your curls to go. It comes with 3 different barrels that lets you change the type of curls you get.<br /><br />I found it works quite well and is easy to use. I had no issues with my long hair because it has the long barrel to accommodate all my hair and actually curl it all. All in all I am quite happy with this.,[],B08LPC1G23,B08LPC1G23,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1618753807681,1,False
3.0,Just an average brush,This brush fits nicely into the hand but I find that the bristles are pretty soft. If you have a tangled beard this will struggle a bit to get through it to be honest. Also if you have a coarse beard this also may struggle quite a bit. For shorter beards this will work quite well. All in all I find it is overpriced for what you are getting and find it just to be average.,[],B08K2HC58L,B08K2HC58L,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1615147181670,0,False

The cream itself is very creamy and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any residue.<br /><br />The skin feels soft and smooth when you use this cream. I for one like how my skin feels when I use this. It looks nice and just feels moisturized.

5.0,Neat eye crayons,"These crayon eyeshadow sticks are interesting. It definitely takes a little getting used to, to work with them but once you get the hang of them they are a nice way to add color to your eye lids.<br /><br />On one side they have the color crayons and on the other side you have a little brush that helps you work in the eye color. In this set you get 6 beautiful colors in the purple scheme which is great. The colors are pretty rich in pigment and they blend quite nicely. All in all I am quite happy with this and for $12 this is not a bad price at all. It is an easy way to create an eye look with just one or two of these.",[],B08MPK4JRB,B08MPK4JRB,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1615041463456,0,False

Inside of it is this amazing smelling firming cream that you will be thankful you got.<br /><br />This cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin.

5.0,"Very nice set, makes for a great gift too","In this pack you get 7 masks for just over $42, so these run you for over $6 a masks. These are on the more expensive side of the spectrum but not yet the most expensive ones I have tried. This is an interesting set of masks that provides you with 6 different types of masks and a double for the hydrating type. You get 2 hydrating masks, one brightening, one clarifying, one anti-oxidant, one exfoliating and one renewal mask. These masks should really cover all you need which is great. They are free of toxins, so no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oil and castor oils. In addition they are biodegradable which is great.<br /><br />These are some nice masks that fit quite nicely and have a good amount of serum on them. I found that they actually have a nice pleasant fragrance that does differ from mask to mask based on the ingredients.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 20 to 30 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. The fit of the mask is very nice so no complaints there. Overall my face felt and looked great after I used it. Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest. But my face did feel great after I used these masks since they were nicely hydrated and felt refreshed after each use.",[],B08GYJY8F2,B08GYJY8F2,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1611411190255,0,False
5.0,Great sheet masks that works wonders for your face,"In this pack you get 3 masks for $18, so this is one on the more expensive face sheet masks that I have tried. I like that it is biodegradable since we really should do more for our environment so I find this to me a big plus. This mask has some very nice ingredients in it like Vitamin C that is from pineapple and others. It is free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, gluten, formaldehyde and vegan friendly.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot. My face felt nicely moisturized when I used this mask and looked great. All in all this is a great mask I just wish it was not as expensive to be honest since it is not on the cheap sice to be used weekly.",[],B08BS3WDPJ,B08BS3WDPJ,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1611410267342,0,False

These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did. I have long, but thin hair, thin in density and thin in thickness and this hair clip worked just fine. I had no issues gathering just a section or the entire hair together. Even though the clips are flat in the front I had no issues at all working with these, they are actually quite easy to work with and fit quite comfortably in the hair. The size is big enough to fit my entire hair or just parts of it.

4.0,Interesting cream that starts of like a butter then liquifies with your body heat,"This facial cream comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar. When you open the jar, the cream inside of it is not one of those lotion types but more a butter type of cream, very solid and almost waxy. Don’t be alarmed it did not go rancid or bad, that is just how this cream is. You will scoop some of it out and will notice it actually smells pretty good. With the heat of your skin it also starts to liquify somewhat and makes it easier to apply to your skin.<br /><br />At this point it absorbs pretty easily and quickly into the skin. There were no issues there at all. I for one really liked this cream and it absorbs fully without leaving any residue behind on the skin. The skin actually feels soft and smooth and smells great, sadly only for a few minutes though since the fragrance does fade fairly quickly, but the softness stays. My skin felt moisturized and was rather happy. All in all this is a great little find.",[],B088X67C26,B088X67C26,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1609082618928,1,False
4.0,Very nice under eye cream,"Fountain of Truth has some interesting products, some I have liked and others that I was just not convinced of. I am happy to say that this one is definitely worth the money. It comes in a tall small applicator with little metal ball applicators. You have to push the top down to expel the product on the top, right by the little metal eye rollers. The under eye cream smells ok, somewhat medicinal, herbal, not bad but not the best either but I can handle it.<br /><br />You use those eye rollers to massage it into the skin which is neat and I personally like it since it does help firming the skin. I prefer to put it into the fridge prior to using it since the cooling helps even more, at least I found it does in my case. This cream absorbs quickly, I do use my fingers in the end to make sure everything is fully absorbed, but it does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin. This stays for some time so I would recommend using this in the evening because of that.<br /><br />All in all this is a very nice product. Yes it is not cheap but this should last you a very long time to be honest since you really don’t need much at all every time you use this.",[],B08FR3QXYY,B08FR3QXYY,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1609081556099,0,False
2.0,"Doesn't lather, smells bad and doesn't clean","I have no idea how anyone can make a body wash with mango wrong, but they did and it is such a letdown. This one is one of the worst body washes I have ever use and it was such a disappointment, I don’t think I will even use up the rest of the bottle. I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn’t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don’t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not. I was not sure if I was even clean using this so I had to use something else on the important parts of the body just to make sure.<br /><br />Even at $5 this is not worth it since it doesn’t even smell great. This is a complete failure and I can’t recommend this at all, sorry I just can’t. At least you know it is super mild since it doesn’t even attack dirt.",[],B07YNDWRCB,B07YNDWRCB,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1609081249231,0,False
4.0,"Good basic oils, many uses","You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal",[],B08LYT4Q2X,B08LYT4Q2X,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1608657012284,0,False
4.0,"Cute set of lipsticks, makes a great gift too","This set of lipsticks is such a gimmick but man I really like them. They are meant to look like a box of cigarettes and the 4 lipsticks are actually pretty small, also meant to look like little cigarettes. This set of 4 will run you about $10 which is not a bad deal to be honest.<br /><br />The little bullet style lipsticks all have very similar tones to be honest but are just different enough that you can distinguish them. They are very easy to apply and you can get a nice pointy application with them which is great. They are surprisingly smooth and creamy and have a good taste to them. They have a pretty good staying power, again it was a bit surprising to be honest. They wear not bad in the waterproof department but did wear off a bit on cups and mugs.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed by these and think these would make for a great little gag gift, especially for young adults dabbling into makeup but also for others as well that are looking for a lipstick that goes well into the purse and gives them options.",[],B08JPK6MKD,B08JPK6MKD,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1608652151919,0,False
3.0,Made my face feel greasy,"I really wanted to like this facial serum. It comes in a little dropper bottle that is common for this kind of product. The serum is a prickly pear oil that is supposed to be very good for your face.<br /><br />When you use it you will first notice the fragrance of the oil. I am not sure if maybe my bottle went bad, but mine just smelled very bad, almost like oil that went rancid. I really didn’t like it at all and it makes it difficult using this product especially since that smell lingered for some time on top of it.<br /><br />The oil is on the lighter side, and even so it took a while to absorb and my skin felt greasy for some time. I would not recommend using this during the day. Especially when wearing a mask, using a facial oil that leaves an oily residue makes my face very hot and sweaty, just awful and this one would do exactly that. Sadly this one is just average at best and I will not be re-purchasing when I run out.",[],B07FQTCLNX,B07FQTCLNX,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1607873804502,0,False
2.0,Hair looked and felt bad,"When I received this leave-in conditioner I was a bit confused. I expected to receive a pump dispenser but when I got the product it was in a jar. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed since I do prefer the pump dispenser but oh well, just wish they would actually show the real product to be honest. The leave-in conditioner itself smells fantastic so that is a huge plus.<br /><br />When you then dip into the jar to get some of the conditioner out, it is actually pretty thin and runny, which was quite a surprise to me to be honest. Taking a leave-in conditioner out of a jar is a bit of a challenge to be honest. Doing a pump or two is just so much easier. I found that this conditioner left a residue on my hair that I did not care for. It also weighed my hair down that just was undesirable as well. I for one am not a huge fan of this one and can’t recommend this conditioner, I just don’t like it sadly because my hair just didn’t look good, nor felt great. At least it is not expensive and it may work for others but this just didn’t work for me at all.",[],B08JH8NGKN,B08JH8NGKN,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1607872522307,0,False
5.0,Amazing facial oil,"Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",[],B07NPCT6L5,B07NPCT6L5,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1606661625081,0,False
3.0,Sadly just an average product that doesn't do much for hair loss and hair growth,This shampoo by Mr. Zaranda was just average in my eyes. I had higher hopes for it but it is what it is. It comes in a generous large pump dispenser bottle that is beautiful. The shampoo is just an average smelling product but again that is not what determines the rating of my review.<br /><br />Inside of the bottle is a shampoo that produces an average lather. I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven’t noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn’t been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don’t see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo. Because of all of that I rate this as an average shampoo.,[],B08G837P9K,B08G837P9K,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1606659519095,0,False

You notice the fantastic fragrance of the mask, very strong of honey which I love. It is very smooth and smells incredible in my eyes.<br /><br />The material of the sheet is very nice and soft. I found it is a bit big however so it does take some adjustment to be honest to make it fit. I do prefer that over a mask being too small however. Make sure to clean your face prior to using it, just like the instructions say. You leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Any residual serum is just gently massaged into the skin.<br /><br />I found that my skin loves this mask. It feels nice and soft, smooth and just looks nicely moisturized. It has a natural glow to it that says I did something good for it. It does feel a bit sticky for about 5 minutes right after, but that goes away and then you are left with soft and smooth skin.

It comes in a simplistic looking squeeze tube, that almost looks medicinal in my eyes.<br /><br />The cream has a very pleasant fragrance that I personally really like. The cream itself is a medium weight in my eyes and does take a little bit to absorb into the skin fully. It does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin that takes some time to fully disappear. Because of this I would recommend this as an evening cream because you wouldn’t want to apply foundation over it, nor would you want to wear a face mask all day while having that on your skin. I found that products like this make me sweat quite heavily under face masks.<br /><br />I use this in the evenings and do find that in the morning my skin looks nicely moisturized, is soft and smooth. So it does look exactly as I would expect it to with this kind of product. To achieve all this you really don’t need that much of the product either which is great because it is not the cheapest product, however also not the most expensive either.

It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to help with that with lots of moisture to be added to the skin but other ingredients as well to help with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nice but mild fragrance that I do like. The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product.

3.0,Underwhelmed - didn't work for me,"I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Luminous Face oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with pomegranate oil, cacao oil infused with white peony root, marigold flower and lotus leaf. This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening.

When I use this my skin feels nice and soft, very smooth and definitely looks beautifully hydrated, thanks hyaluronic acid.  Is this really worth the price?

5.0,Lovely toner that moisturizes well and smells fantastic,"This toner is not inexpensive, but you do get a larger bottle when you receive this toner that is almost $40. The box that it comes in is rather beautiful and the bottle itself is also very classy looking. The bottle itself is a pump dispenser. I usually use a cotton pad when I apply a toner but for this one I just used my fingers instead. The toner is a liquid formula that is on the thicker side with a hint of gel in it almost.<br /><br />This toner contains polyphenols which are actually micro nutrients and good for you, I know it sounds bad so I had to look it up. It also contains sea buckthorn fruit oil that helps brighten the skin complexion and recover from skin fatigue. It contains lily flower extract that helps moisturize the skin and nourish the skin and cherry on top, it contains no parabens.<br /><br />So now when you use it, you notice it has an interesting consistency, somewhat between watery and gel like and it bubbles when you dispense it. It has a very pleasant scent that I really like a lot and this fragrance lingers quite a bit which I am all in favor of. I feel that it nicely moisturized my skin. It didn’t irritate my skin or anything and worked nicely for me. All in all I am very happy with this toner.",[],B07YTWPT2J,B07YTWPT2J,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1601863357302,0,False
4.0,"Nice, but not my favorite fragrance and a bit overpriced","This is an expensive facial moisturizer at $60. It comes in a little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser opening, which are personally my favorite because I think these are just too neat. They claim  a visibly smoothing of wrinkles which I personally can’t say that I have seen happening.<br /><br />This moisturizer is light to medium weight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest. So I can recommend this for a moisturizer but not really for a wrinkle remedy. Downside, it is pretty expensive and I have moisturizers that are less expensive and also have a better fragrance.",[],B08C37KWRR,B08C37KWRR,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1601827045452,0,False
3.0,"Tiny bottles, not a fan of the fragrance, overpriced","I have always been a fan of Taya hair products. I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn’t it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this. I am sorry I just wasn’t impressed with this set, especially since you can get the full sized ones for a similar price really.",[],B086XH7BWW,B086XH7BWW,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1601819843429,0,False
5.0,Incredible hair serum - just everything right about it,"This is a fantastic Leave-in hair serum. It is not too expensive at $25 since you get a nice sized bottle and you really don’t need a lot of this serum when you use it. You then distribute this serum in your hair and when you do that you notice the incredible fragrance of this serum. It is probably my FAVORITE fragrance in my hair products. Its this amazing mix of tropical fruit and this something that is just amazing! It is hard to try out other things when all I want it is this one.<br /><br />It comes in this easy to use pump dispenser and you just do a couple of pumps and distribute that in your palms. Then distribute all then evenly into your hair that is either wet or damp. Your hair is easy to brush through at that point, not a tangle in sight. Once my hair was dry it was soft, light and shiny. Everything it promised it would do. My hair just looked amazing and felt soft.  I love this product, it smells amazing, my hair looks incredible with lots of shine and lift to it, and it just feels amazing, soft and smooth. I can’t say enough good things about this!",[],B077MYW993,B077MYW993,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1601012103409,0,False
4.0,Very rich and moisturizing - thick cream,"This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.",[],B08575Y9V3,B08575Y9V3,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1601006929046,0,False
3.0,All considering not bad,"In this box you get a set of 12 lipsticks. These are supposed to be matte lipsticks but I found they are borderline matte to satin lipsticks really. These will only run you about $10 so definitely on the cheap side. Each lipstick comes in a little plastic container that has a Halloween themed print on it. They are fairly cheap but again, getting 12 lipsticks for $10 I don’t have high expectations.<br /><br />I found there is some range in colors but not a big one. There are some darker colors and some lighter colors and then the rest all was somewhat similar. I was a bit disappointed by the colors really, but then again, for the price can I really say anything about that? There weren’t really any nudes in there.<br /><br />The lipsticks were easy to apply but not that creamy. However they feel ok on the lips. They are not very sticky or anything but also don’t feel super smooth or creamy on the lips either. They feel just ok really. They don’t taste or smell of anything. Their staying power is ok, they wear off as you eat and drink like a lot of lipsticks do really. So considering these costs $10 for 12 of them, they are not horrible. They feel ok on the lips, the color range is limited in my eyes but they are not bad at all, all considering. Keeping everything in mind, I am rating them at 3 stars.",[],B08GBZGRDQ,B08GBZGRDQ,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1600567115131,1,False
5.0,Very comfortable and fit well,"We have now all been dealing with COVID for some time now and sadly have gotten used to wearing masks. At work I have to wear these types of surgical face masks as part of our PPE in the lab. When I saw these for this price I figured it was worth getting to have some disposable ones around. I have some cloth masks but they should be washed and when I forget or they are in the wash it is nice to have a back up.<br /><br />You get this convenient box with 50 disposable masks in it. I really like that you get this in a box so they are easy to use. In the box you get 5 bags of 10 masks each which is great. So you can actually take one of these bags and keep them where you need them, very convenient.  These are similar to the ones we use at work and these work. These fit well and are comfortable. They get the job done and protect me while I am out and about and need to be protected. It is a strange world right now but I am glad we have ways to get these kinds of masks right now. They do have the little metal clip on the nose so you can make them fit properly which a lot of people don't usually do for some odd reason, but especially if you have glasses you really should take advantage of that. The loops around the ears were plenty big so no complaints there.",[],B08FBPYYVH,B08FBPYYVH,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1600563008982,0,False

A lot of time when these shampoos contain tea tree and hemp their fragrance is not the greatest, but this one was shockingly impressive and really good. The fragrance of this one was actually really good and you can barely smell the tea tree which is great. I only smelled hints of it while it was on my hair.<br /><br />This shampoo produces a nice lather that wasn’t too rich but plenty to get my hair nice and clean. I didn’t feel like I needed a lot of it to get my hair nice and clean. I did let it sit for a couple of minutes to let it do “its thing”.  It rinsed out very easily and left nothing behind in my hair. My hair felt nice and clean and looked great. I followed up with a leave-in conditioner afterward still but my hair could have handled not using one after this shampoo.

It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good.

It is itch-free and hypoallergenic as well. It also has oatmeal extract in it which is known to be soothing.<br /><br />It has a pleasant scent reminiscent of clean baby in my eyes. When you use this the skin feels moisturized afterwards without having used a moisturizer. But the skin does not feel greasy or oily which is great since I am not a fan of that feeling.  You also don’t need to use a lot of this in order to get the benefits of the product. And yes I admit, I actually like using this on myself.

It produces only a medium lather but it still works quite well to clean your hair. I personally prefer a nice rich lather with my shampoos.

I let it sit in for a little bit since it is supposed to help you with your hair, making it thicker and richer.<br /><br />It rinses out with ease leaving your hair squeaky clean.

The rose quartz rollers are very cooling on your face and you could actually remove the heads, since I wouldn't put the electric part in the fridge, you can put the heads alone in the fridge for extra cooling. This will amplify the effects of this massager and help massage away the puffiness in your face.<br /><br />This is one fantastic find and for just $21, you can find some for a little less than that but I really like the design of this one.

It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great.

It feels fantastic on your skin and if you keep this chilled it will feel even better yet, especially if your skin is irritated by the sun. I found this works for all kinds of irritations really and really like how my skin feels when I use this.<br /><br />It is very lightweight and absorbs very fast into the skin.

It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great.

With the dropper you can apply just a few drops, which is all you need to each side of your face. The serum is very lightweight and it absorbs very quickly into your face and just literally disappears into your skin. It leaves absolutely no residue behind which is odd because it has a real oil like consistency so I expected an oily residue on my skin.

5.0,"Love it, oriental scent that is very similar to LouLou","This is a very nice perfume. It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.",[],B08739QVNW,B0BTJ6SYKB,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1596026312471,0,False

The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. I found that my face had a slight residue but after about 10 minutes that did fade away and I was left with nice and soft skin.<br /><br />As I said I like this facial skin overall and I had no reactions to it. I have normal skin and don't expect any issues in general though.

3.0,"Overpriced, doesn't smell like argan oil and to me just about average",This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.,[],B00O2FGBJS,B00O2FGBJS,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1595710638513,0,False

Once it is dry, it is definitely smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get thicker eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked longer. There was no clumping or flaking which was good. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were happy.

4.0,Very nice spiral ties but a tad on the expensive side,"I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends. Last year when I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are a gorgeous minty green. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $13 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten to date so not sure if that is worth it but these are nice and sturdy and made well.",[],B089JYBGVC,B089JYBGVC,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1595293528150,0,False

It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face. It then rinses of nice and easy and you don't have to keep going over it over and over again like some cleansers which is nice.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is great. It actually still feels pretty moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was really necessary which was nice so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it.

The colors are 2 beautiful earthy nudes, one more pinky nude and one stunning red tone that is just plain perfect! This is a gorgeous set in regards to colors.<br /><br />Now the applicators are so unique and different and stunning on their own. They also have a magnetic closure of sorts because when you close them they kind of pull shut at the very end so they must have a magnetic closure in it.<br /><br />The lipstick themselves are super creamy and feel amazing on the lips. They have a pleasant taste to them and are just amazing. There is nothing but greatness about them and these are worthy of the name Sigma! I love everything about these and can only recommend this set.

2.0,"Interesting concept, way overpriced and fell short in my eyes","This is an interesting concept. You get 15 bubble pads in this container. Each pad is dry though when you get them. You can actually slip your fingers into the pad which makes it easier to use these pads. With these pads you can exfoliate so that is in theory nice but I found in execution it just didn't work as well. The pads didn't have a pleasant scent, well they were actually rather scentless so to me that was rather boring.<br /><br />So when you use them you wet the pads and then clean your face with them. I found that there wasn't as many bubbles as I would have expected from a ""bubble pad"" so that to me was disappointing. They overall cleaned my face ok and I found they didn't dry out my face too much. All in all these worked ok but I wasn't too impressed. You can get a bottle of a nice cleanser for the same price or maybe more but that will last you a lot more than just 15 applications! so to me this is way overpriced and a bit of a waste to be honest.",[],B0851C4YPC,B0851C4YPC,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1594395709227,0,False

This gold digger moisturizer smells amazing and I can't really figure out what it is, but it is the mix of cucumber and melon which is always a winning combination. It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while.

One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get.

5.0,Very nice mattes and lots of beautiful shimmers/glitters,This is a nice little eye shadow palette that contains 16 eye shadows. The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue.

5.0,Fantastic oil but just not too crazy about that strong essential oil scent,"I am so torn about this oil. It comes in a glass dropper bottle like most oils come, mostly to protect the oil. Make sure you mix it well since the gold settles on the bottom of it, yes it has actual gold flecks in it. Besides the actual 24k gold it has all natural ingredients making this an actual edible oil. You can use this on its own or mix it with your moisturizer or foundation if you want.<br /><br />So this is a high quality product and worth every penny in my eyes. When you use it you will notice the strong essential oil scent and this is why I am torn. It is just a bi too almost medicinal to me. It is a scent that in my eyes should be in a massage parlor in the essential oil diffuser healing you of something. So for me it was just rather strong but thankfully it does not longer on your face too long.<br /><br />The oil is not too thick and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It leaves a slight oily residue on your face and I don't fault it for that since it is an oil. However, if you give it about 10 minutes or so, that oily residue disappears and you feel just soft and smooth skin. Absolutely amazing in my eyes. I love how my face felt when I used that to be honest and was a bit shocked.<br /><br />So I love how it makes my face feel and look, I just need to get over the scent but since you really don't smell it on your face for long I think I can handle it.",[],B07VSZYKCH,B07VSZYKCH,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1592700605667,1,False

Even a beginner should have no issue with these. I used them with and without a primer and they had fantastic staying power so no complaints there either.<br /><br />The shimmer and glitter were fantastic to make the look standout. Either one works for whatever occasion you have in mind, shimmer for day to day wear and glitter for a more evening wear in my eyes.<br /><br />At almost $30 for 4 colors this is a bit more on the expensive side since I have gotten some fantastic inexpensive palettes for less with a lot more colors but this is a very nice palette and great for travel really.",[],B086MLH81X,B086MLH81X,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1592493322137,0,False

I found my skin looked great as well so this one in my eyes really ticked all the boxes. I felt there was no residue left on my skin either.

2.0,A sticky mess with an ashen yellowish color that smells funky but at least you are protected,"I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look.

It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time.

I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails.

Both of them are sulfate free which is great, however when I read the ingredients it turns out that the shampoo actually has silicone in it, not a fan of that. Thankfully the conditioner does not seem to have any in it.<br /><br />So the shampoo is not bad. The scent is decent, nothing spectacular though just ok in my eyes. It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set.

1.0,"Read the description carefull, says it is actually for fungus and will make your nails fall off","Beware, this is a product that is meant for nails with toe fungus and to completely remove those nails and start fresh!<br /><br />They make it sound like it is to strengthen nails that may need some help but once you read the instructions on the box it actually tells you when you use this product that your nail will fall off.<br /><br />It smells pretty horrific. So unless you have severe nail fungus and want your nails to fall off, don't use this. I haven't tried it since that is not what I wanted. When I got this I read the ""renews, restores and dehydrates damaged nails, repairs and protects"" not makes your nails fall of.

5.0,Incredible sheet mask that makes your face really happy,"This is a very nice sheet face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",[],B07J1LYVHC,B07J1LYVHC,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1584453999779,0,False
4.0,Not a bad facial serum but does make your face somewhat tacky,"This is an interesting serum for your face. The bottle comes in this interesting dropper bottle that only shows the dropper when you unscrew the cap. The serum is a milky kind of solution, so make sure you mix it well before you use it just to make sure it is well mixed.<br /><br />The serum is kind of thick but absorbs quickly into your skin. Your skin stays tacky for about an hour or so. After that it becomes fairly nice and soft.<br /><br />The serum does have a scent to it but I can't describe it. It is fairly nice though so no complaints there. I have had no negative skin reactions or issues when I used this product.

4.0,"Very nice, just slipped a little bit","These are nice under eye patch masks. They have a nice mild citrus type of scent, almost like mango so not sure how they can say they are unscented because they are not. I personally really like the scent so that is a plus in my eyes. Also surprised how some reviewers say they are unscented. So confusing.<br /><br />These come with a small pair of plastic tweezers to help you get the little patches out. The patches come in a cute little jar. The patches are thicker, gel like and very nice. I had an issue with them staying in place though. You keep them on for about 10 to 15 minutes or so. By that time they are almost dry so all the active ingredients are mostly in your skin or on by the time you are done. The rest you just let absorb when you remove the patches.<br /><br />The patches are nice and cooling and I really like how they feel on. I just wish they wouldn't slip since they did slip on me a bit. Not a big deal just a little annoyance.",[],B07V2L94ZW,B07V2L94ZW,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1584196769567,0,False
5.0,It works quite nicely but is this really a bit issue? Who knew,"This hair finishing stick works quite well. It comes in a similar tube as your eye mascara does and also has a similar wand to it. The gel is clear and very lightweight. It feels almost like water when you have it on your hair really. It is not sticky or greasy really.<br /><br />I was surprised that it works quite well and the staying power is pretty good as well. It is fairly cheap to so not a big investment there and definitely reasonable. I am not sure how big of an issue it really is though to get something like it. I guess if you are going to a big event and you want everything to be just perfect this is a product for it, but on a day to day basis I wouldn't really bother with it.

5.0,Very nice but a little bit more expensive then others,"I have pretty long hair and most people with long hair know the issue with split ends. The last time I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are blue but with a tie dye kind of effect in them, super cute. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $10 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten.",[],B0849YFB92,B0849YFB92,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1584023431001,0,False

I didn't care for it at all and thankfully it doesn't linger on your skin either.<br /><br />When you use this moisturizer it is pretty light but is sticky on your skin when you use it. It does absorb fairly quickly though. My skin just felt ok when I used this. It didn't feel super soft or anything nor did it look anything spectacular. This to me was just a middle of the road kind of moisturizer. Now considering all this and the cost of $63, I just can't recommend this product.

Some times you don't even have a checked in luggage so this is important.<br /><br />I like that in this pack you get 5 different ones. You can dedicate each one to a different perfume so you can bring different ones on your travel. These work very well and you can bring enough on your travels for at least a week plus. They are easy to fill and use and work very well.

3.0,Not bad but not the greatest either,"You get a lot of hyaluronic acid serum in this bottle. It is pretty much scent less for those who prefer that this one is perfect in that regards. There were no hints of thyme, so not sure if it should smell of it since it is in their name? It feels very tacky on your skin when you apply it and stays that way for a few minutes. So it does take a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin. Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br /><br />They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br /><br />Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle. I ended up looking it up and it does have a fairly low pH.

You also get a little mesh pouch where you can store these pads in and also wash them in the washer. This way you won't loose them. It seems they really thought of everything you could possible need! I have been looking for something like these for some time and this is the perfect set.

My skin did feel a bit dry after I used this though and I would have wished it would be more hydrating as they promised. I had to follow it up with a nice moisturizer to make sure my skin didn't dry out too much when I use this cleanser. In my eyes this cleanser is just ok. I was a bit disappointed by the entire line to be honest. It is a bit on the more expensive side with all their products being at least $34 and up. Some of them are on the even more expensive side in my eyes for what you get. They do tend to fall short on the fragrance side across the board.<br /><br />This line is just not for me and did not perform well for me overall.

4.0,Very nice mascara but a little bit overpriced,"This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper.

It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18.

Most of their products I have tried to date either don't have a scent or smell kind of bad. Considering how expensive they are in general that is just not acceptable in my eyes. Thankfully this one actually smells pretty good since it is also pretty expensive.<br /><br />This heavier cream actually leaves behind very soft skin that looks good. I liked how my skin felt. The scent of it does dissipate fairly quickly though but that is ok. All in all this is probably my favorite product in their line.

Plus the weird handle they have really doesn't make them very user friendly either.

Nowadays a lot of lip balms are flavored and to be honest that is one of the criteria why I pick certain lip balms.<br /><br />Yes this one works and its staying power is pretty good.

Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner.

It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else.

5.0,Great brushes!,"These wooden brushes are just plain fantastic. The bristles are nice and stiff but not too stiff to hurt you. Stiff enough however to stimulate to provide a good scrub, wet or dry for that matter.

The second brush is an oval brush that just has the stiff boar bristles that helps to exfoliate and smooths the skin.<br /><br />Using these brushes dry helps cleanse your skin but also stimulates your lymphatic system. It promotes blood circulation, helps excrete toxins and relaxes your muscles. Plus it just feels great! You can switch the handle between these two brushes for the one you need it for which is convenient in my eyes. I really like using these and they are just good for you and feel fantastic.",[],B07SD7GP25,B07SD7GP25,AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,1579711950718,0,False

A tiny bit goes a long way!<br /><br />This product comes in cute little pump dispenser that works very well. After I used this product I didn't think my skin felt super soft like it felt after using some other serums in comparison, it felt ok no doubt but not like with some other serums so that was a bit disappointing. I also found this product did not smell very good, similar to their moisturizer. I am not sure what it is about this line.

What I did not like about this moisturizer is the scent of it. I can't pinpoint what it smells like but I did not particularly care for it. Thankfully the scent does not linger very long on your skin. The other thing I did not understand that in the directions of using it it says "" follow with moisturizer or makeup"". Why would I have to use a moisturizer after using this moisturizer? Pretty confusing if you ask me.<br /><br />All in all this product is just ok in my book.

I was also supposed to get a makeup brush cleaner in this, but that was missing.<br /><br />In this set you get a powder brush that was nice and fluffy and worked well. You also get a foundation brush that was also very nice. The flat cream concealer brush worked well and you also get a concealer detail brush that again worked really well.

4.0,Potential.,"Besame classic lipstick (Forever Red 1925) is creamy, moisturizing and conditioning. The color is a bright red, which gives you just the right amount of pop, especially if you are wearing a solid color (like black, blue or grey). I wish it was a deeper red, but regardless I will make it work. It makes my lips feel soft and smooth. It isn’t drying at all. It doesn’t bead on your lips. I wouldn’t consider this a matte finish, but it isn’t really shiny either. It has decent staying power (you can eat or drink while wearing it). Overall, this is a terrific lipstick to put in my rotation.

This product is cruelty, vegan, sulfate and paraffin free (Peta approved since that is important for some consumers).

2.0,$50 for a plastic brush?,"Clearly Amazon has mis-priced this brush. $50, for a plastic handled brush and firm bristles? First, I am ok with the plastic handle. It is easy to grip and hold. And since it is plastic, you don’t have to worry about it looking faded after several washes (I do clean mine) like you do with the wooden ones. I’m even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I’m not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don’t like is the PRICE. I can’t believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn’t even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box.

4.0,Leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.,"LaClaire (Beverly Hills) Clarifying Cleanser is a delight on the skin. Simply add a dime sized amount, with a little water and distribute on your face with your hands (or if you prefer a loofah). The small (1.6 ounce) pump bottle is simple to use and doesn’t take up too much space in the cabinet or on the counter. There are some pretty nice ingredients that include tea tree oil, salicylic acid and aloe. I’ve used the product for a few days now and have not noticed any dryness or irritation. Nor have I noticed any redness or rashes. The scent of the cleanser is not strong (smells like tea tree oil) and does not linger long. And finally, what I like the most? This company has made a product in a bottle that is reusable. I really like companies who have a philosophy to reduce their impact on the world. Being socially aware of how their products can affect the environment and actively doing something about it is a company that I can support. You can reuse the bottle and add liquid soap or other things.",[],B07DXCVLY7,B07DXCVLY7,AEGYU6OM2X66SMZN6AF3TSQ3N5PQ,1535780279369,0,False

3.0,Undecided still.,"This is perhaps one of the most difficult reviews that I have written in a while. Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can’t decide. I’m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn’t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven’t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven’t looked in the mirror and said “wow” or “gosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment”.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review.

I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer.

I let it soak in clean water 3x until the murky, dirty water ran cleaner. Then added a nice rich conditioner and a small spritz of argan oil.

I used dehydrator and a primer and when I put the base coat on, it would not smooth out and was lumpy.

It comes with a storage for those accesories. I used the general use nozzle and noticed that the dial has no arrow to tell you what strength you're putting it to, you would only know while the power is on and the stream is going. On the lower setting, the water was spurting, not flowing smoothly, but did on a higher setting. There is a suspension control to pause it while using it. After you are done, it instructs you to dump the water.

4.0,Effective,"I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products.

I liked the masque overall and it seemed to improve the tone and texture of my skin. I knocked off a point because it was a bit cumbersome to use and waiting around for 30 minutes seemed too much for me. I've got very sensitive skin and this was not of problem for me to use (although I did patch test first). If you know what you are going into (the time and effort) I'd recommend this product.

5.0,Stamping Game Changer,"I am not new to nail stamping, but I only recently became aware of She Modern Sticky Stamping Polishes. With traditional stamping polish it is necessary to work very quickly in order to successfully transfer the image onto the nail, and beginners frequently struggle to get the timing down. Even experienced stampers have difficulties with extremely fine lines or highly detailed images; the stamping polish just dries too quickly inside the very shallow etching. After watching several She Modern videos on YouTube and ordering a small set of sticky stamping polishes, I was eager to test them out on a stamping plate I’ve been unsuccessfully trying to use for over a year. My very first effort was flawless! The She Modern performed perfectly. Beginners will definitely find these polishes far, far easier to work with as they learn the basics, and more advanced stampers can enhance their artwork by using pigment powders, foils, and glitter. In addition, She Modern offers a comprehensive selection of watercolor polishes for techniques such as lead lining, reverse stamping, etc. The only limit is your imagination and She Modern even helps with that by providing live demonstrations of their products and techniques on YouTube every Tuesday and Friday. Tina very thoroughly and patiently opens each session by answering any questions from attendees before creating a nail design with various products. It’s very helpful to see them in use and gives you ideas for your own nail art.

5.0,"This Is A Great Design- But Caution, How To Get Out Of A Jam","I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.

5.0,This Line Continues To Impress Me (I Have Tried Many High End Products),"I have tried many high end skin products over time and I also make my own skin care which I use a lot as well.  Once in a while I like to check out another line to trade off for a while.  This line, Wow.  I am impressed so far.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box.  The bottle inside is glass with a lock pump top.  Turn to the side and you can pump and then turn it back and it locks.<br /><br />TEXTURE OF THE LOTION<br />This is what I would think of as a lotion texture.  Thick, but not too thick.<br /><br />MY SKIN TYPE<br />I tend to have normal to dry skin and it has some uneven patches on it which most probably don't notice, but I do.<br /><br />HOW I USE THIS<br />I start with the XXI cleanser which is great stuff.  Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin.  After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that.  I only do this 1 time at night.<br /><br />RESULTS<br />The results of this product line have been really impressive.  My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />My skin glows after using this.  It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will continue to buy products from this line (well the ones I mentioned, anyway).  I really have been thankful to have them right now.  They have given me a boost when I really needed one.",[],B096YFBWGX,B096YFBWGX,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1633625520069,0,False
5.0,Perfect For Baby Fine Hair (Even Adults),"I have baby fine hair.  That means that although I can make it look like I have quite a bit of hair, in reality, my pony tail is the size of a watercolor brush.  I need hair ties that can pull my hair back, stay put, and not destroy what hair I do have.<br /><br />HOW THESE COME<br />These come in a plastic bag.<br /><br />COLOR<br />The colors are all brilliant neon which I LOVE, except the blue- I would call it neon navy if that were a thing.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />These work perfectly for me.  I use them alone on hot days and even have them stay put during exercise and activity.  They do not tear out my hair when I remove them either.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These hair bands are perfect for me.  I have baby fine hair and not as much of it as it looks, so having these is perfect.  They also work well for kids.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am thrilled to have these.

5.0,"GReat Bronzer For Medium To Lighter Skin Tones, But Great Eye Shadow Too- Read On","As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410yTw5sabL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410yTw5sabL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410yTw5sabL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hzp9SWCwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hzp9SWCwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hzp9SWCwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08BMV4C42,B08BMV4C42,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1596228737656,4,False
5.0,"Nice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On","I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410yTw5sabL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410yTw5sabL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410yTw5sabL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hzp9SWCwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hzp9SWCwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hzp9SWCwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08BMYPHD2,B08BMYPHD2,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1596227932470,5,False
3.0,"Halloween Or Messing Around Okay, But Serious Wear, Not So Much","I have been working with wigs for quite a few years now.  One thing I know is a good quality vs not so great quality wig.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br /><br />HAIR<br />This wig has some great hair. the colors are definitely platinum white and what I would call light auburn base hairs.  The white hairs are about 1/3 or so longer than the auburn hairs.  There is a nice kink to the hairs.<br /><br />THICKNESS<br />That is where this wig is sadly lacking.  At the top, the wefts of hair are way too far apart. The lace in the cap is a very light butter colored yellow.  The hair is not too thin, but it is not quite thick enough to cover hair below.  Yes, this comes with a nylon cap, but it just is not comfortable with those.  If you have dark hair it will definitely show the bright colored lace and elastics through the wig when the wind blows.<br /><br />BANGS/STYLE<br />That is where this wig is just not practical unless you don't mind looking stupid for a party or Halloween.  The bangs are WAY too long for anyone to wear.  That usually would not be a problem, but what you will get instead of the cool light ends on the entire head is chopped bang that is bland looking and then these white cool looking ends around the head.  The bangs are best cut painstakingly so that the auburn is cut way shorter (about 2/3) than the white hairs.  That takes a lot of time but worth the effort.  Then you have to cut them at a staggered manner.<br /><br />Other than the bangs being hard to trim so you can at least function with this wig on, the overall style is fabulous.  I love how it falls and looks while on the head.<br /><br />ELASTIC BANDS<br />Inside the wig, there are elastic bands with hooks to help hold the wig on the head. You might want to take them down to the spot you like it in as the hooks have a tendency to come undone during wearing.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT IN A WIG<br />Believe it or not, I would actually wear a wig like this with the right outfit, and not to be silly either.  I prefer wigs that look authentic,, and can be worn realistically as well as for fun.<br /><br />1.  I have to be able to see out of it<br />2.  I have to be able to wear it comfortably without fussing<br />3.  I want it to not have my real hair showing<br />4.  I want it to look realistic<br />5.  I want it to last for quite a few wearings<br /><br />DOES THIS WIG PASS THE TEST?<br />I am giving this wig THREE stars because it is hard to wear and see.  In order to trim this in a realistic manner, I have to take a LOT of time and that takes stars off for me.  I happen to love the style and coloring, so I am wiling to put the work into it, but honestly, I think it should be a bit shorter in the bangs area since it is so hard to trim and keep it looking real.  Also, the wefting on the top is just a bit too widely spaced.  I wish also that the cap was made with light auburn lace and elastic instead of the icy yellow colors.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want to wear this for fun, it will be hard to see and hard to trim and not look silly in this.  It is comfortable and the style is epic, but there will be work required.  You can bandana it to help, but it still will look a bit floppy unless trimmed a little bit in the bangs/fringe area.  I like this, but it takes work to wear and not look silly for me.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  The trimming of the bangs is VERY time consuming since we only have one shot at it and if it is screwed up, then the wig is toast.  I wish there was more hair on top and that the lace cap did not show as easily.  A darker cap underneath (light auburn color) would have been much nicer with this.  I will still use this, but it could have been a bit nicer with small inexpensive changes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Es3GMjinL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Es3GMjinL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Es3GMjinL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DUjv23l9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DUjv23l9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DUjv23l9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KJaknBduL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KJaknBduL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KJaknBduL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08B15D9Y7,B08B15D9Y7,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1594342218670,0,False
5.0,"Used For Watercolors, It Works Well For Small Details","I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.",[],B07ZJX5MNJ,B07ZJX5MNJ,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1593455018534,0,False
4.0,"Seems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid","I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.

4.0,Simple Scent Free Skin Care Absorbs Easily Does It Do What It Says?,"I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, ""WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?""<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.

3.0,Not Quite As Nice As I Had Hoped- BLINDING At Times,"I was spoiled.  I had a wonderful big compact mirror from OTT LITE some time ago.  I used it a lot.  However, it broke and I could not replace it.  I was hoping  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This mirror closes and snaps shut with a plastic clip on it.  It says open, but honestly, it is not easy to do.  Once open, the inside has the 10X magnifier on one side and the reguiar mirror surrounded by the light ring.<br /><br />ON/OFF<br />This has one light brightness- on.  There is a little switch on the back that you push from one side to the other to turn it on and off.  It does not shut the light off when you close it.<br /><br />CASE<br />The case is quite slick.  If it is cold out and my hands are cold, it is sometimes a bit tough to hold on to this.  Most of the time it is not a problem.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS<br />This is a bit too bright for me.  It really does seem to be so bright that I can not look into the regular mirror long, but the magnifier is okay IF I REALLY WANT TO SEE MY PORES.  Sorry, but it is a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />BATTERIES<br />This takes 2 CR2032 batteries.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I am not really that impressed with this mirror.

Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do.  There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well.

The device has four buttons on it which are power, temp up or temp down or timer.  The bent curling iron is supposed to be more handy to use.<br /><br />MANUAL<br />The manual is bare bones.  It looks fancy but never tells what temperature or time would be good to start with for different types of hair.  That was very disappointing.  It does tell how to basically press the buttons and what they are for, however.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />We tried this several times on various occasions.  Each time, we set the temperature higher and higher until we were at the top temp but very few of the curls we tried making worked.  The hair simply had a light bend in it.  When using a different curling iron with each person, the hair looked great.  Finally after trying for the last time today, we have determined that this curling iron just does not work.  I am not sure if we got a bad one or what, but it just does not do hardly anything except leaving a partial bend in the hair no matter how we wind it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although a great concept, this curling iron did not seem to curl hair properly no matter what hair we used it on or how high or low the temperature was set.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.

It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.",[],B07J3GH1W1,B07J3GH1W1,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1545168972059,1,False
5.0,Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have,"We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.",[],B078BBZM54,B078W6XC3C,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1518711174440,10,False

The ability to fold it up so it takes less space is also beneficial making it easier to store or take up less space on your counter top.  The mirrors are clear without scratches or flaws.  The stand is plastic, so it may not be as durable as a mirror with a metal base or stand.

When she brushed through her hair, she felt it reduced the static and made her hair feel softer.  So much so that my wife never got the chance to use as my daughter claimed it as hers.  The brush handle is made with a thick, durable feeling wood.  The bristles are much more durable and pull through the hair better than those with plastic or silicone bristles.

This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It's a very ""cologne"" type scent which I really don't care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn't like the scent at all.",[],B081HDSNTS,B081HDSNTS,AFLBMDZDIPCHMWWA7CXQXITPBJKA,1580146726935,0,False

The packaging looks very nice and professional and the leather is soft and bends easily—this made it easy to tuck it into a larger bathroom bag. All of the clippers seem to work well without issue. I did take one star off because the little pair of scissors are really thin and flimsy. The first time my husband took them out to cut his large toenail, it bent them.

I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work.

My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...it looks alive and healthy. My beautican is astounded.

I think you can get two uses out of each one, but obviously, they're meant for single use.<br /><br />This stain works VERY well. The I am Fine color is reddish-brown, but it was a very nice red color on my lips. And my fingers - be careful when you apply these since they do stain. It's best to exfoliate before you use them, and to line your lips since I noticed a bit of bleeding/feathering when I used the product. Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain. Then again, the applicator is a cotton swab (so no fine control) and you get a LOT of product with it.<br /><br />It does last all day unless you eat something greasy/buttery.

3.0,"pretty colors, some staying power","Okay, I love eyeshadow palettes and probably have too many, and they range in price and brand. I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this. That's not to mean it won't work better on other people.<br /><br />Still, for the price it's a nice range of colors and a fun palette to play with, so it's worth a try.",[],B07DSC4X3K,B07DSC4X3K,AEEHSGIEOXLHDMNDUYGX4R4W5TZA,1546619951297,0,False

5.0,"Easily absorbed, may not be the fountain of youth, but feels good on the skin","eb5 line has been around for some time now and I have noticed their advertisements in print media over the years, but have not tried any of the line until I received this bottle of Collagen Booster Serum.  I am very surprised that I like this serum as much as I do, and I am more surprised at the competitive pricing for the entire line.  With no added fragrance, my sensitive skin responded well to the light and creamy product that was readily absorbed.  My skin was prepared for moisturizing and there was no irritation or annoyance due to a fragrance of the natural components which can occur.  The pump action is terrific and the cap keeps it protected from the elements, yet it is quick to remove for application.  There is no excessive packaging, so little waste.  Many years ago, Robert Heldfond Jr. and I were casual friends in San Francisco, occasionally having coffee together in North Beach, and I have thought of him each time I would see his father's picture in the advertisements I mentioned earlier.

5.0,Nicest organizer of this type I have seen has clear attention to detail,"Plastic and/or acrylic organizers come in all sizes, shapes, configurations and qualities.  MelodySusie® has blown me away with this three part, multiple sectioned organizer with drawers.  Just so you're clear, you get a base with four drawers, each with an flattened oval shaped pull, each lined with a black textile that can be removed or used as you choose.  The edges of the drawers are beveled, giving this an aura of elegance, but most importantly, each drawer slides in and out with ease, regardless of whether or not the drawer is packed or empty.  The bottom of the base has a little strip in the form which raises this organizer from sitting directly on the counter, so if it is used in a bathroom, air can circulate around the entire piece and grungy mildew and such is reduced from forming.  Don't forget to dust, though.  The exterior edges are beveled, giving them a very finished appearance, unlike those sharp edges on many similar products in the marketplace.<br /><br />Included with this organizer are two additional pieces, each is the same dimension as the interior of the top ridge of the chest organizer, so you can decide which one you want to put on top and which one you want to put next to the main component.  Or you can separate them entirely and use the top of the organizer to put items and use the two multi-sectioned components separately.  You could line them up side by side along a dresser top and have more width rather than extended height.<br /><br />I love the assorted sizes of the sections and the angles top of the shorter of the two pieces.  I also love the rounded design in the sections of the taller component.  Every aspect of this trio is outstanding, high quality, and it makes quite the impression in addition to comfortably storing whatever you like in each compartment.  Each edge is finished, every detail has been considered, and it is even practical in that it can quickly be cleaned with no harsh detergents. This lovely item was made in China and it is clear that quality control is important to the manufacturer because I saw no defect even after intense examination.  Be prepared for a weightier set than you might expect, because there was no skimping on the materials.  It is perfectly packed for protection and is ideal for presenting as a gift.  It is well worth its price point.  A sample was provided for review.",[],B00XBRCWSM,B00XBRCWSM,AGCA64OUVM2TJGNN3IUXMEU7KF6Q,1433945172000,4,False

But with a keratin treatment, I can even just blow dry my hair and it look fantastic. This saves so much more time and it makes styling last for days. I also hike and get sweaty and my hair still looks great after it dries. Once, after a day of kayaking, I rode in the back of a friend's truck back to the marina, and my hair still looked terrific. This of all things has given me the hair I've dreamed of. And at $10-$15 per treatment, this price is right.<br /><br />Of course, it does smell terrible.

3.0,I only use La Prairie  (this is the newest version of the name) products - for 12 years now!,"Since there aren’t any reviews for this product, I thought I would write one for those who aren’t familiar with the brand, or the item. I’m now 66 years old and have been using only La Prairie products for my face since 2009/10. My face looks better than ever because of it. This item in particular is a very gentle, easy to apply and use, facial cleanser that doesn’t require any water or actual washing process. It goes on a cotton pad (not the balls!), and not too much either, and you gently wipe your face and eye lids going in a circular motion - and always apply outwards and upwards. This will help your skin from being pulled down, which can cause more wrinkles. The company has changed the exact name of the product, but it’s the same (only an improved version) as it always has been. For me, I use this as the first step in my nightly facial ritual - which is to cleanse the face. I follow with other products in stages, finishing up with the moisturizer (one for the face and a different one for the eyes). My rating of this being sold online is hard, since it’s a wonderful product, however it’s outrageously overpriced for what’s a ‘trial size’ and ‘free’ gift, given out with purchases of a full size La Prairie item (depending on how much you spend, and where you buy, it might be just one of multiple free trial size items). The FULL size of this item is about $100 USD, and it’s around 8 ounces +/-. The bottle is probably 8” high and a couple inches wide at least. So part of my rating is based on the product itself and the other part is on the price for this size. Another thing I want to mention is that I have sensitive skin and have never had any issues with this product line! You’re face will thank you!",[],B08YP8S5K5,B08YP8S5K5,AFVFEYJ52POQG4CQ2IK4S5OMYUMA,1637249892882,0,False
5.0,Happy with this soap,"I liked this particular scent much more than others that I've tried, from both Michel Design and other brands. The peony has a distinctive smell to it but unfortunately it doesn't last long enough after taking a shower. The bar is a large oval shape and a little awkward to use at first - it gets easier as it's used more. The design of this and other products from MDW is very pretty and would make a nice gift for someone too. The soap has a LOT of creamy lather that that rinses clean and doesn't leave much soap scum on the shower walls. I have tried other triple milled soaps from L'Occitaine, Pre de Provence, Australian Soap Works, and 2 others that I can't readily recall the name of. All these are similar in price but the quality of this is much better, at least in my opinion. I have found that some fragrances are a bit stronger than others and I think it's just a matter of choosing one over another according to preference. This company makes so many different things for the kitchen and bath and I have bought quite a number of them for myself and plan on buying more for gifts. I noticed one review of this scent that said it had an awful smell to it, whereas mine is good - unfortunately this can happen if the bar is old and depending on the seller. This doesn't mean that every bar of soap is bad! My only negative comment is that the peony scent doesn't last long enough!",[],B00I9JIAFG,B00I9JIAFG,AFVFEYJ52POQG4CQ2IK4S5OMYUMA,1502638357640,2,True
5.0,Good cream without sunscreen,This is one of La Prairie's less expensive moisturizers and it's good. It can be used day and/or night alone or over a serum or one of their other products per directions. I use this cream during the day because I don't really need a sunscreen. I've also used this at night when I run out of night cream. In my opinion all of La Prairie's products are excellent and worth the high price - I don't use makeup so it's important for me to make my face look as good as it can be. I'm 61 years old and have been using this line for about 7 years. Depending on skin type and age I think some of their products work better than others. As with all their products a little goes a long way. The current price on Amazon is quite a bit lower than what I have to pay in a department store which is more than $200 for the same size jar!,[],B002AMUG5K,B002AMUG5K,AFVFEYJ52POQG4CQ2IK4S5OMYUMA,1485884114000,0,False

3.0,Not Bad But Won't Dilate Your Pupils Either,"I had high hopes for this little baby, but after using for a few days, I must say it's just &#34;okay&#34;.  Perhaps it may be because when I bought it I had thick (or used to before my brush starting feasting on it) hair down to my butt and was tired of finding enough to knit my cat a sweater in my hair brush every morning.  So I wanted something that was more user friendly.  But then on an impulse I cut my naturally curly hair very short.<br /><br />The Pros:  It seems sturdy and well-made with a nice grain.  It's smooth (the teeth on the plastic picks tend to splinter and peel with time).  It feels comfortable to use.  It probably has good stay power.<br /><br />The Cons:  By far the biggest for me is that the teeth are spaced much more widely apart and are much thicker than I expected from the photo.  This means you can't really get the curl definition that the picks with a more narrow spacing will give you.  I also wish the handle were a bit longer.",[],B01M1I8MDE,B01M1I8MDE,AEMRW74WOEBX33JMZZV47XITIEEQ,1485129703000,3,True
1.0,Did not work for me,"Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I'm dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it's messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I'd have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don't work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here's a good reference website:  [...]",[],B001GILLJ4,B001GILLJ4,AEMRW74WOEBX33JMZZV47XITIEEQ,1339963084000,5,False

4.0,I will never use a dry shaver again.,"For the past 4 years, I was using an expensive Braun dry shaver and not getting a close shave. Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.

5.0,A Surreal Dreamy Experience – Say Goodbye to Anxiety and Hello to Confidence!,"Today I tried out Liquid Trust for the first time. I put some on before getting in the car with my husband. He sort of looked over at me at one point but I don't think he knew why. Two sprays on my wrists was all it took to see real effects. It made me feel sort of dreamy and not talkative. Like I just felt very relaxed and happy. We did not argue in the car for the first time in weeks probably because I was not talking up a storm as usual.<br /><br />People at the grocery store seemed to be smiling at me as I was walking around pushing my cart. I will say smiling may be an effect because when I saw my husband walking down the hallway at home before we left I smiled spontaneously and felt very happy to see him.<br /><br />My cat Wolfie thinks I'm great now too and when he smelled this on my wrists he got really affectionate and marked my wrists with his cheeks. A sure sign of approval.<br /><br />This has a slight powdery musky scent if anything. It is barely noticeable and my husband who hates me to wear perfumes did not complain at all! The ingredients are SD alcohol, purified water and oxytocin.<br /><br />So I feel this oxytocin perfume calmed down my anxiety in general which made other people around me more open and friendly.<br /><br />To be honest this was a surreal and dreamy experience. I felt calm, yet open and loving and very relaxed. When I keep sniffing my wrists after using it I feel a sort of calmly ecstatic in love feeling.<br /><br />I'd say this is the real thing. It also did not cause any sensual feelings and no one was attracted to me or me to them, this just reduced anxiety and made me more accepting. I did notice however that I was hyper aware of every man in the store. So it must trigger some protective elements in the brain.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to married couples who are looking to deepen their intimacy and who want to stop being irritated with each other and get along better.<br /><br />I avoided anyone pregnant while wearing this as advised!<br /><br />I am not a doctor nor is this review medical advice. Please consult with your doctor before using. I also don't advise using this for nefarious or deceitful purposes because the karma would not be good! Use at your own risk!<br /><br />For people in love in a committed marriage relationship, this Liquid Trust can help keep you calm when needing to talk. I'd suggest both people wearing the perfume on their wrists. The scent is sort of unisex and not overly strong. Very mild really, barely noticeable.<br /><br />So a good experience and it does what it says it is supposed to do. The anti-anxiety or anti-cortisol effects are very apparent. Don't you just need a break from stress now and then? Now you can spay this on your wrists and sit down and feel dreamy, happy and secure. For some confidence might be a nice side effect. That is probably why salespeople use this.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B000J1HR6U,B000J1HR6U,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,1658031620756,1,True
5.0,Soothing Comfort - A Hand Cream That Exceeds Expectations!,"Goop Beauty's hand cream is soothing and deeply moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and leaves hands looking nourished and hydrated. The skin on your hand will almost look a little plump, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I had high expectations for this cream after trying the lip balm and I was not disappointed. The tube is fairly small, but perfect for a purse or pocket. I have my tube on my bedside table for use before bed. This is one of the best hand creams you will ever use. The secret? Shea butter as one of the top ingredients. You may want to get more than one tube! With all the handwashing we've all done in the past two years it is nice to have a cream that is protective and healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B09RTQ34LM,B09RTQ34LM,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,1652811326164,1,True
4.0,Loved Two Movies!,"If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect. Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...""Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?"" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",[],B0948NMZ1F,B0948NMZ1F,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,1637374784203,2,True

I have one in the bathroom on the counter, one in the kitchen and one on my bedside table. That way any time I need a hand cream this is available. I also use this as a body lotion. This is the one Zum fragranced cream that smells the best to me and the scent dissipates quickly after use. To be honest my hands look ten years younger when using this particular lotion. There are a lot of essential oils in it so I think it is antiaging.

I've been finding out lately how the hemp plant can make you more beautiful and even lose weight and cause your skin to be clear. This hair shine product is the icing on the cake of your hemp expenditures.<br /><br />The scent of this oil is very mild and pleasant. The oil is such a fine mist that it does not weight down the hair and seems to absorb well leaving a glossy shine. I saw this product a while ago and finally purchased some for myself! It will impress you with its natural ingredients and beautifying effects. I love it and I think after doing research around you will find this is the best shine product.<br /><br />This ships in a plastic bag but I did not find it leaking at all!

So this is my second favorite and it is nice and sparkly, mildly flavored, not overly sweet and definitely not sticky. What is not to love?<br /><br />I use a lip balm first, apply a lipstick and then put this on top to hold the look together. It lasts quite a while or until you eat something, then you need to reapply. But I put this on before I go out and it lasts for hours.

5.0,Radiant Skin,"If you are looking for something to make your skin look super healthy, toned and vibrant this is a good option if you are used to using serums. I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.<br /><br />The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes.",[],B01DEDYWD0,B01DEDYWD0,AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,1467931118000,0,False
5.0,Cooling and Calming,"If you live in a dry climate you will especially love this moisturizing, calming mask. It goes on like a gel and cools the skin while it refreshes your complexion. I can't say enough good things about this mask. I have sensitive skin and it calms redness and irritation completely. The truth is you will want to use this every day. I put the mask on at night before bedtime and leave it on for ten minutes. Once washed off my skin is baby soft and plumper. Hours later it still feels like my face is cool and comforted. It especially helped to calm my skin down after I used a serum with retinol in it.

You really don't need a lot so it lasts a lot longer than other less rich hand creams. This one is super moisturizing with luxurious shea butter, apricot kernel oil, coconut oil, aloe leaf juice and safflower seed oil. It also has a calming flower extract.

This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />""Marsh Mallow"" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows.

This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.<br /><br />""Marsh Mallow"" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy.<br /><br />I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind.<br /><br />I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel.

That is SUCH a nice feature – manufacturer, please don’t remove that from the item.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spilled my fractioned oil everywhere because it was difficult to contain since it’s thin.<br />Once I had worked through the 5 rollerballs for my family needs, I had enough room in the bottle to make a BIG batch of the massage oil with the rest of the fractioned oil.  IT WORKED!!!  I’m soooooo happy with this bottle of fractioned oil.  I can easily pump out what I need to work out my sore muscles and apply to hubby’s back (he has scholosis and other degenerative issues).  I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to use fractioned oil for their essential oil uses.<br />I have opted to test products as a hobby and thus, received this product at a reduced price in order to fully test the product offered.

2.0,"Hair is OK, tape is iffy. Possible return.","I just installed these last night. I wanted to cover up some intense layering that I think makes my hair look frizzy when straight. Was initially pleased with the color and quality but the tape is not very strong. Now I'm realizing after styling that not only is the tape bad, but the hair is sketchy. Some of the sandwiches are already pulling apart and do not feel sticky. The hair itself smelled slightly synthetic while I styled it, and I noticed the ends bubbled up with heat application like synthetic would. I also noticed several strands of super thick, plastic-feeling pieces. I pulled one off the weft and it snapped apart like it was plastic. Tried to take a picture of the bubbled ends as well as one of the thick pieces.<br /><br />I've used other inexpensive brands that have had better tape, and don't mind synthetic when you know it's what you'll get.

4.0,Fantastic natural-looking STAY PUT color with excellent pencil shape for easy application,"Okay, I am a fan but with caveats. I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx.

I'll admit there are times when you are going out and the outfit that you choose would look great with some color to your skin.  Well, that is why I purchased this self tanning lotion and thought I would give it a try.  We are now in the winter months in New England so I chose to test this product on my mid section and abdomen where it would not show if this was a flop!<br />Much to my surprise I now have a bronze belly!<br />The lotion is a good size bottle of 8.5 ounces and is a very army green color when dispensed.  Be sure to wear a disposable glove when applying or yes, your palms will turn bronzed.<br />I applied this sparingly as the directions stated and waited two hours and I am impressed with the color and that there is no streaking.  I have since showered several times and reapplied and the results are great.  I am very anxious to be able to do this in the warmer weather and have a good looking tan for the first time in years.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61--6UiYnQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61--6UiYnQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61--6UiYnQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ig1hzlskL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ig1hzlskL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ig1hzlskL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00GDKBUDM,B00GDKBUDM,AFXVOJ6333POWDFHZRCGF6AUD2IQ,1451355832000,1,False

Depending on where I put the clip and what size it is, the cap can be a little tight or can fit perfectly. I would say make sure you use a low profile hair clip.

5.0,What kind of sorcery is this??!!??! I Cannot stress enough how truly AMAZING this liner is!!!,"I originally purchased this eyeliner at a Kohls department store for my daughter for her to practice with makeup. However, I ran out of my regular eyeliner one day and I had to use I had to use hers. It was soooo AMAZING that I immediately went to Amazon to see if they had and to my pleasant surprise, they did.<br /><br />It glides on with ease, its true to color and doesn't lighten after application. Its EXTREMELY precise and beyond easy to use. It is by far genuinely the EASIEST liquid eyeliner I have used in my 25plus years of using liquid liners. The felt tip is more hardened which makes its SUPER easy to control and place on the eyelid, whereas other liquid liners have softer felt tips which are floppy and they bend easy leaving you with having to press lightly so you don't mess up your straight line. This E.L.F liner is opposite of ALL that, its hard but not TOO hard that it doesn't glide precisely with your stroke. It has a PERFECT sized super thin tip which allows me to give my cat eye a precise small line finish at the corner of eye, it's perfection!<br /><br />My most FAVORITE part of this liquid eyeliner is that it does NOT get cakey, if I want a thicker more pronounced look, I can go over the same line several times and it doesn't cake up. I mean sure if you're gonna put 10 layers on, I'm sure it'll eventually cake, but building  with 3 layers, no cake! First time I tried to do thicker line, I was so nervous not wanting to mess up my entire eye makeup, but I had faith and gave it a try and was SHOCKED that it didn't get thick and cakey, and it still looked like I only had 1 layer of eyeliner on.<br /><br />Did I mention it stays put! I'll sometimes get watery eyes in the corner of my eyes, and this magic liner doesn't smudge, doesn't rub off, it could be that my make up setting spray helps, or it could be the eyeliner, but whatever it is its definitely some sort of sorcery. Haha.... But regardless with the insanely affordable price, you WON'T be disappointed!!!<br /><br />It removes SUPER easy with make up remover, or just soap and water, I always wash my face, then use make up remover to get any remaining make up off, and the eyeliner always seems to be gone after just soap and water.<br /><br />Truly the best bang for your buck!!!!",[],B00853F6ZS,B00853F6ZS,AHSI4DGJ2Y6QI74XNW6A73ELDGTA,1625091247635,3,True

4.0,Better than flossing or brushing alone!,"This is a good water flosser . I’m comparing it to others I have owned. The last one I had did not last long- this appears to be better made and it just looks nicer overall. The water well holds a fair amount of water however I would like it to hold a bit more. It has many levels of power for the water to spray out. The low is very weak and the high is pretty darn strong and could be painful if you aren’t careful. There are plenty of adjustments in between so you will find one that suits your mouth just right. It also has a “massage “ button which basically cuts down the strength of the jet and makes it pulse to massage your gums. I find it a bit too soft of my gums , even on the highest level.  This product does a great job in cleaning between your teeth and below gum line. I hate to floss so this is a great option to keep my teeth clean and well cared for. If your house is Not new and only has one plug in your bathroom, you will appreciate the long cords- both the electrical and the water hose. One thing I like about this water flosser  is that it does NOT leak like my other one did. This keeps my counter neat. This is a good product to add to your daily dental hygiene regimen . It is easy and does a great job cleaning .<br />* If you found this review helpful please click the button below to let Amazon know.

I love my Dry Bar Buttercup hair dryer, but really wanted a diffuser for it because I like to scrunch my hair time to time. When I added it to my cart, it was $21 I believe. That's still cheaper than Sephora so I was going to get it but waited. SO GLAD I DID. Randomly, it dropped to $12.12!!!! Purchased immediately!!<br /><br />It fits my hair dryer perfectly. But, I can tell by looking at it that my hair dryer isn't a standard size on the end so I had to purchase the Bio Ionic brand since that's who makes my hair dryer. Worth it! It says universal, but I would still take measurements to make sure it'll fit yours if it isn't a Bio Ionic brand because they are not ever all universal.<br /><br />The part that attaches to your hair dryer is not a hard plastic- it is rubbery (but firm) so it slides onto your hair dryer but doesn't &#34;click&#34; into place. I think that's why they say it's universal because this allows for some difference in the size of your dryer. But still do your research and compare your hair dryer to the size of the Buttercup hair dryer because it fits it perfectly.<br /><br />You can also twist the diffuser to open up the vents or close them to control the air flow (see pictures). There will always be air flow on the outer ring of the diffuser, but you can completely close off the center, which is nice if you don't want a ton of force.<br /><br />I love it and it was completely worth it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kn8itsw7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kn8itsw7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kn8itsw7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712skDos3uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712skDos3uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712skDos3uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714V2mbMZAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714V2mbMZAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714V2mbMZAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ltyuf8MfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ltyuf8MfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ltyuf8MfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xq5olb6-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xq5olb6-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xq5olb6-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r3wJr1RjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r3wJr1RjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r3wJr1RjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71txeLR2SZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71txeLR2SZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71txeLR2SZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00PM5QEX0,B00PM5QEX0,AHB67O7LBHNHB3ED7MHWDBHDWL6Q,1462040564000,52,True

5.0,Great straightening brush.,"I never brush my hair, because, when I do, it just becomes a very frizzy mess. I was worried this brush was going to provide the same results. I'm happy to say, I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised by how well it actually worked! This set comes with two strong clips for helping you separate your hair and a cleaning brush.<br /><br />You'll need to start with clean, dry, and tangle-free ( as much as possible) hair for best results. If you want to change the temperature setting from Celsius to Fahrenheit just press down on both temperature buttons at the same time. Also, They have temperature recommendations based on hair types; 410°F-446°F (210°C~230°C) for fine hair.<br />374°F-410°F (190°C~210°C) for normal hair.<br />338°F-392°F (170°C~200°C) for soft hair.<br /><br />  What I really like about this brush:<br />1. It gives my hair a more natural-looking straight hair versus my flat iron.<br />2. It's very easy to use.<br />3. The bristles are very long which keeps the heating element away from your fragile scalp. I never felt my head get hot while using it.<br />4. I could safely and easily use this brush on my oldest daughter to tame her hair craziness. I wouldn't say that about my flat iron.<br />5. This brush would work for most hair types. My underneath layers of my hair are very thick, coarse, and extremely curly while the top layer is thinner, and just wavy.<br /><br />  My dislikes:<br />1. The control buttons are placed very inconveniently on the brush handle making it very difficult to not accidentally change setting while in use.<br />2. The bristles are long. This makes it safe to use, but difficult to tame those little flyaways that are very close to your head.<br /> 3. This isn't a problem for my hair, but from my use of this product I don't think it would work well for those that have spiral curls.<br />4. The back side of the brush also gets extremely hot; be careful!<br /><br />  Overall, I really like this brush and feel it is well worth it's price! I will still keep and use my flat iron for special events, but i know I will use this brush for everyday styling.<br />  I received this product in exchange for honest feedback.

3.0,"Paraben free, silicone free, sulfate free but not EWG verified","I searched the EWG website for this company and product and in many spelling varieties and came up empty handed. If this product was indeed EWG verified, it would not only be on the website but it would have the EWG logo on the product plus it wouldn’t have linalool which is high on the allergy list.<br /><br />Other than the linalool, this has decent ingredients. It is silicone free, paraben free, sulfate free and alcohol free. I would stay away from this product if you have malassezia (fungal) acne as olive and japonica may be triggers and/or pore clogging.<br /><br />Like all natural bar shampoos, it won’t lather like traditional synthetic shampoos but it does clean. It takes some getting use too and a period of detoxing for your hair to get use to the change in chemicals if you are switching from synthetic to natural but it is worth it!<br /><br />I would recommend this shampoo bar however I am rather concerned about the EWG verified claim.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfdhU74PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfdhU74PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfdhU74PL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZADlW1d-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZADlW1d-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZADlW1d-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91BgAjU0SCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91BgAjU0SCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91BgAjU0SCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91T79JvA0mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91T79JvA0mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91T79JvA0mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VGIh8ZbNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VGIh8ZbNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91VGIh8ZbNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B093JGCRWX,B093JGCRWX,AE3KLVXGZPANXE5XLXYKHTVAZ3FQ,1628722253112,3,False

I just need some volume, not length so I cut these which was really easy. All you need is a sharp pair of hair cutting scissors and a pony tail holder.

4.0,Pretty decent product but do your research,"Overall, this product isn’t horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne.  After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating.  Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone’s skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another. Learn your skin and what products work best for you. Personally, I would stay away from this product if you have very dry skin and/or sensitive skin. I have “normal” skin (no sensitivities, not overly dry or oily, limited acne, no allergies) and didn’t have any issues with this product so far. It has a light scent that isn’t overpowering but completely unnecessary (I HATE fragrance in beauty products; stick with essential oils). It absorbed nicely and didn’t leave my face feeling oily. I am giving this product 4 stars as of February 21, 2021 due to the minimal ingredients and will update this review once a larger amount of time has passed to fully understand how to works with my skin.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711XwrvCiQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711XwrvCiQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711XwrvCiQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716AUXTo+ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716AUXTo+ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716AUXTo+ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AmYY0SAuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AmYY0SAuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AmYY0SAuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UYcFiNhYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UYcFiNhYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UYcFiNhYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YS2EnEkDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YS2EnEkDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YS2EnEkDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k3oDpmqTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k3oDpmqTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k3oDpmqTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01N7A5AGF,B01N7A5AGF,AE3KLVXGZPANXE5XLXYKHTVAZ3FQ,1613917893005,2,False

I soaked my feet for thirty minutes then I took this wooden foot file and went to work on my super dry feet. WOW, it worked wonders.<br /><br />I was going to put a picture up, but I'm sure no one wants to see my callus feet with dead skin. That's just gross. As far as longevity, well, that's up to you. You can wash these with hot water, but after a while, you will need to throw it away and get a new one. As far a price does, I have seen this same size at a brand store for a few dollars less.

5.0,Smells Great and Helps Tame Big hair,"I received my new Argan Oil shampoo and was super excited to start using it. I have thick natural, healthy, unprocessed shoulder length hair. What I noticed with this shampoo was first of all it took a lot of shampoo the first time I washed it (one of two times) to get my hair to lather. Since this is organic I was not surprise to find this, but disappointed that it seemed to take so much shampoo. My fix the second time I washed my hair was to use a different shampoo for the &#34;starter wash&#34; and to use the Argan oil for the final wash. I LOVE how the shampoo smells and how it looks when I've finished blow drying and styling my hair. My hair is quite thick and can get kind of frizzy and have fly aways which did not happen with this shampoo. Typically I cannot wash my hair everyday, as it usually takes a couple days for my hair to &#34;fall&#34; and not look so &#34;big&#34;. Fortunately, my hair looked great immediately with this new shampoo. I also washed my hair before a house party for New Years and had MANY compliments from various family members over the wonderful smell of my shampoo. Several requests were made by my mom, sister, sister in law and niece to tell them the name of my shampoo.

You have to be careful when placing them also as  you cannot really adjust the position because pulling the lashes off usually tears the liner off with it, so you have to then clean the lashes and reapply liner if you make a mistake which is kind of a hassle.  The two lashes included here are nice but neither one really worked for my eye shape, I got another kit which had 7 different shapes in it and that one had two styles that work well for me so I would probably recommend getting one with more options to ensure you find one that fits your eye shape.",[],B088JWX1QF,B088JWX1QF,AGQWCGCJ5VK5KIBQBDTCHRT74EPA,1599146346897,0,False

I bought these on a recommendation to test out and see if they helped.  I've only had them for a few days, and can't really say yet if they've done anything for my pores or not, but they do seem to be doing a really good job at exfoliating my skin.<br /><br />The individual towels are roughly 12 inches wide by 24 or 30 inches long.  They're made of some sort of woven nylon or plastic material that is kind of wavy and extremely abrasive when rubbed across the skin.  You use the towel by putting a dollop of liquid soap onto it and then rubbing it onto your body to create a lather.  The towel is long enough that you can easily scrub your back by holding the ends of the towel and pulling back and forth.  The towels are abrasive enough that it really feels like you're scraping a layer of skin off.  Probably not appropriate for use anywhere sensitive.<br /><br />I'm loving these so far.

The toothbrush works great and the only feature my dentist recommends is the 2 minute timer to make sure you give yourself enough time to brush all your teeth. I've always used string floss in the past, but this water flosser seems to work just as well most of the time. Sometimes there is some food stuck in my teeth that I still have to use the string for.<br /><br />As I said, features are minimal. There is 1 charger for both devices, so you can't use the charger as a stand for both items. Instead of all the cardboard in the box, why not include a cheap plastic tray or stand? There also is no travel case, just a little cover for the toothbrush head. I would really prefer a full length hard case to be included instead of having to buy an aftermarket case that doesn't fit well.

I continued to search and learn about high gloss, matt's, waterproof and plumping, supple and antiaging recipes and I am now ready to give this a try.<br />It all looks pretty basic, even cleaning the mold.<br />Right now I have my favorite (not necessarily healthy) Chapstick in every room, all vehicles, and in my purse for constant dry, hot, freezing, desert weather protection and I can't wait to replace them with my own tints, and colored lipsticks.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ykEYOPRnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ykEYOPRnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ykEYOPRnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085VWXN1K,B085VWXN1K,AFBQHDFKKLIUSLAGOTOSF2MGOSPA,1612734962269,0,True

4.0,Works great,"""Jeff's Wife"" - I've used the white name brand for years and some store brands but not the charcoal ones.

4.0,Nice set,"&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34; - I got these when they were an Add-On Item for $3.99, definitely worth the price. The stamper works great, I didn't even wash it first (even though you should always wash new stampers before first use), and it's slightly (I do mean slightly) softer then other clear stampers I own.<br /><br />If you're new to stamping or not familiar with clear stampers, they are more delicate than opaque ones and tear easily, so be gentle with it. Wash it with dish soap & warm water, dry with a paper towel and clean it with a lint roller or tape. Never buff it or use acetone, you'll make it cloudy defeating the purpose of a clear stamper. When picking up, ROLL GENTLY over the image if you apply too much pressure it won't pick up. When applying the image to the nail press straight down (again, with GENTLE pressure) and rock side to side or roll from side to side. Don't push the tip of the nail into it, it will tear.<br /><br />All the plates stamp great, I didn't swatch every image, although plates 29 & 41 have shallow etching (in my experience this is normal for BP plates) so the thinner scraper is a nice addition. It's not as thin as the 0.5mm and not a thick as the 1mm ones I own, I'd say it's 0.75mm (I didn't get out the calipers). There are different size images, a little for every nail size. But I do wish the water marble designs were bigger, I'm not a Water Marble Witch yet. Plate 52 is great for lead lighting or Sharpie water coloring.<br /><br />The stamping guide works like it's supposed to, I've added a photo to show how it's used just in case it's confusing. I have a set of 4 templates from another brand already, there's not much difference in size or thickness of the metal but the designs are different. The edges aren't finished, like a plate with no backing, but I don't think it would cause anyone to slice their finger open unless you're being extremely careless.<br /><br />All in all a great set.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jDlAJAfML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jDlAJAfML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jDlAJAfML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lV1EqaPDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lV1EqaPDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lV1EqaPDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71usCiduF6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71usCiduF6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71usCiduF6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B071FT6S51,B071FT6S51,AHE5RLELYXWSMUVORWWJI47PWU3A,1501006369421,4,True
5.0,Good for Nail Art,"&quot;Jeff's Wife&quot; - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.<br /><br />If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vgmPfeR3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vgmPfeR3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vgmPfeR3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00FAT8N46,B00FAT8N46,AHE5RLELYXWSMUVORWWJI47PWU3A,1491946906000,0,True
5.0,Great stamping polishes!,"&#34;Jeff's Wife&#34;- These are so good! I only wish I had the original versions to compare. I've only heard negative things about the original stamping polishes from BM so I don't own any, I've only used MdU. But when BM reformulated their stamping polishes I gave them a try and I now own all the new collections so I gave these a try too. Boy am I glad I did. These DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish. The black I use is MdU, the absolute holy grail of stamping polishes. But I have to say that these are beyond good! This black is comparable to MdU black in every way, except the smell.

4.0,interesting...,"I wasn't really sure what dermaplaning involved before I ordered this product. I watched a couple of youtube clips and decided to give it a try. These tools are bladed scrapers that are used to gently scrape away dead skin and tiny hairs to give your face a fresh, clean, healthy look. In the videos I watched, there was a considerable amount of icky skin removed- literally piles of it! My experience has been much less dramatic. A whole face application resulted in just a tiny amount of ""dust"" to be removed. I applied a bit too much pressure at first and gave myself a little scratch, so do be cautious. These blades are sharp!<br />I feel that my skin does look brighter and more healthy. Those videos of dermaplaning likely feature models who had been tanning and not washing their faces so the dirt and oil really built up, and skin was ready to peel.<br />This product removes tiny ""peach fuzz"" hairs but I also tried it on a small patch of coarser leg hair that I had missed while shaving.

If you do get this use it on arms and legs, then get a separate one for faces. That's kind of a hassle though so I'd just nix it all together and get a kid one that doesn't burn their eyes.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that it doesn't go on blue and fade.

I rubbed my hand on the brush and there was mascara on there, it just really did not thicken or lengthen at all. The bristles are also molded plastic, so they are scratchy and do not work well at distributing product. It's one of the worst designed mascara brushes I've seen.

While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc).

With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again.

I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable.

I give it a slight edge over my old one because the rose quartz is pretty. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really pay attention to that. If it is having an effect, then great, but for me, the rolling action helps me wind down at the end of the day. The motions are soothing and quartz is cool against the skin.

I like how sponges can use a bit of water with the foundation to help with spreading the foundation on the skin and this sponge does a nice job of this. The foundation goes onto the skin so it looks sheer, fresh and polished. It also does a good job of blending so concealer conceals but doesn't appear obvious. I like that is easy to clean and doesn't have the ""make up sponge"" smell. If anything makes me stop using a make up sponge, it is the rubber-y used smell that it can get, but this sponge doesn't have that smell so I'm glad of that.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice makeup tool to have in the make up box.

It does have a strong perm solution smell that lasted through the first shampoo, but since it is so good with my hair, it is a small price to pay.  It is important to do a test curl if your hair is a bit longer in order to ensure the bottom curls as much as the top. I didn't time it right last time and the bottom of my hair didn't curl as tightly as the top. A test time would have helped.

As I've gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.<br /><br />I can't say if there's an anti-aging effect going on here since the only place my age shows on my skin is on my face, but if the way my skin feels after applying it is any indication, I'm getting younger by the day.  It's a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don't need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don't hesitate to try this stuff.

5.0,Perfect for tight space on marble subway tile in bathroom (not in shower),"I did not purchase this on Amazon, but purchased at a local store because I wanted to physically view it first.

This is my children's bathroom and I wanted to give them a mirror to help them with brushing their teeth.  I needed something small that did not require nailing or gluing and that would not break and hurt my children if it fell off.  This item pretty much perfectly fit the bill.  My one worry was that it would not actually stick to the slightly uneven marble tile surface.  I was also a little worried that the image would be warped and ultimately unhelpful.  I have had this now for about a year and it has held up beautifully.  It fits in the space perfectly, has a nice modern and clean look that blends into the slightly grey tone of my marble tile and most importantly, stuck without any problems (make sure to stick to clean DRY surface), even with small fingers poking at it.

4.0,"Great hair cutter, easy to use.","My wife is a professional hair stylist. She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears.

4.0,A great way to trim your beard!,"This is a great way to trim your beard. A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the ""Turbo"" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards.

5.0,The BEST for preventive maintenance &repair of your skin,"Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book [[ASIN:0743292561 You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)]].  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.<br /><br />Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.<br /><br />I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).",[],B000G8LWZI,B000G8LWZI,AGTVTC3QVSRN7VPXGQKHOKVHNEVQ,1214856570000,36,False

4.0,Likeable liquid lipstick,"To me the shade on the product picture looks like it might have a little pink in it but I don't notice it when I apply it. Maybe that's just me 🤔 Regardless, I feel the shade is very pretty...and definitely is metallic.<br /><br />It's also very long-lasting- to the point that later when taking it off, I used both an oil cleanser and makeup remover. Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good.

I wore turtle necks as long the season would allow. I discovered this stuff and it covers them so well, you can't even tell there is red/purple marks or new sore ones! You can of course see some bumps but blending the color with my skin, it's not noticeable. It also helps to heal them and I've been getting less and less and the year went on. Now I use more sporadically, to hide what scars are left but this product seems to help them fade! If I apply it when I feel one coming on, it helps to reduce the inflammation and rids it quicker. That could really be because there is green tea in it.  My daughter uses it to hide her teen acne and in fact my son puts a teeny tiny drop on his cystic spots as well to tone down the redness.

4.0,Nice grooming set,"My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />""You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set.

4.0,Great shampoo and conditioner!,"This is an excellent shampoo and conditioner set. It's nearly perfect. I'm putting this at a 4.5. Now I don't know if this is just my hair being obnoxiously dry or not but that would be the only thing that I could say anything remotely ""bad"" about. The conditioning was just not quite enough on the ends of my hair. Great on the already healthy stuff, just seemed to ignore the drier ends. Figured I'd get that over with and move on to the good stuff.<br />This really gave my hair a nice shine to it. My hair is getting old with me and it no longer wants to be as manageable and tame as it once was. With this duo of delight my hair looked healthy after it dried. It looked good when left to air dry, when dried with the hot air brush, and when left to air dry. It looked shiny without the added matching shine spray (which is also a wonderful product) and with. I left out the word smooth in this so far but let me tell you! It was also smooth and sleek without having to use other products to make it stay that way. Granted, under all that grey old hair there has always been fairly thin straight hair so this just really put it back to looking like it used to in that regard. The shampoo cleaned it to the point of being squeaky clean as well.<br />Give this duet a try if you can.

3.0,Probably works well depending on your skin type,"My husband is the one that used this because he was going through a rough patch. He is more prone to acne than I am and recently he's been getting more and more breakouts. I asked him to let me know how he felt about it after using it. Here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />""So like many people i have been wearing a mask all day. It's hot and it becomes humid under the mask. Perfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it.

5.0,Great brushes!,"This is a very good set of brushes and combs, especially for the price. They work great. You get four things in this set. You'll receive a paddle brush, a rectangle comb, a detangler hair brush, and a tail comb. I don't really use the combs as much as the brushes but did give them a bit of a testing so I could type a review. I absolutely love all of these brushes and combs. They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much.

4.0,Make your eyes feel delightful!,These are terrific! I really like these hemp and rose under eye mask patches. If you have puffy tired eyes that crave some tender loving care then these just may be what you need. They work so well. You put them on under your eyes after washing and drying your face. Just leave them on for 10-15 minutes and when you remove them you gently massage the product into the skin. That's it!<br />The one thing that isn't so great is that they are so hard to separate when you first open the packet and take them out. They stick together and to themselves and it's very frustrating trying to get them without losing the liquid and getting yourself all covered in it. Other than that these are a definite win.,[],B07TN32GM1,B081D87QCJ,AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,1586445693499,1,False

I personally don't use hair pomade or those light shave creams. I prefer foam and my hair just sort of keeps my head warm.<br />Aside from the items I can't use there are some great items in here for everyone. The body scrub soap like and feel a good bit more fresh after using it. But my preference, and where I really came to appreciate this, was with the facial moisturizer and lip balm. I don't usually buy those items and let the winter have its way with my face. I ride a bike everyday. But using the items in this kit really helped me keep my skin from drying, and my lips. The lip balm tastes and smells great, too.""<br /><br />That's what he had to say about it.

5.0,Works perfectly,I really like this face wash. It's one of the most gentle washes I've ever used. It has the lightest smell of cucumber which I don't like too much but at the same time it is a refreshing clean smell and it isn't overwhelmingly strong. It seems odd to give a five star to something with a scent that isn't quite one that is liked but this is a very good face wash and I absolutely love how clean it leaves my face feeling. It doesn't cause a red face or breakouts. It does seem to help prevent acne and even help to minimize it when it happens. It's definitely a new favorite.,[],B07T4JF9M7,B07T4JF9M7,AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,1585149828605,0,False

It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like ""restore"" and ""fortify"". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this.

2.0,My lips and this didn't have a lasting friendship,"Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of this one. It didn't do much to help my lips. Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up.

4.0,These work very well,"This mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can.

3.0,Good scrunchies but...,"(3.5)<br />Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are very nice. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are not supposed to pull your hair as much or get stuck like many others do. That is true of these! The scrunchie works great. It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's a good scrunchie but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one.

1.0,Not Sure if This is a Joke,"I honestly don’t even know WHERE to begin with this review 🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I have, in my lifetime – and, wearing “fake” nails for OVER 25 YEARS – NEVER seen this type of … idea 🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I’ll be as short as possible with this …<br /><br />Most anyone who hasn’t had an amputation, usually has 8 fingers and 2 thumbs – total of 10 “DIGITS” ✋🏻🤚🏻 And, in MOST cases – the nails are usually shaped the same.<br /><br />Thus, in a set of nails you’d need:<br /><br />💅🏻 2 – Thumb nails<br />💅🏻 2 – Index fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Middle fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Ring fingernails<br />💅🏻 2 – Pinkie fingernails<br /><br />I know – sounds almost silly or stupid to mention, but that’s math. Total “NAILS” needed: 10 … (“Luxury 12pcs press on nails kit comes with 10 different sizes which is pre-numbered 0-9 in a box” … “choose the most suitable size that fits you every finger”). Hard to fit every finger when the nails are different sizes.<br /><br />And, we’re NOT all sized the same. Hence why some packaging is no less than 24 nails with 12 sizes. I know because I’ve bought nails like this for YEARS! Just look up KISS and you’ll see what I am talking about.<br /><br />This?<br /><br />Was this a joke? This is a set of TWELVE (12) nails – 10 different sizes! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️<br /><br />Unlike the model hands – I don’t wear my nails OVER the edges of my finger. That is NOT how you wear these nails to begin with – and definitely NOT with nail glue. Even being “fake”, the nails should at LEAST attempt to look realistic. See how the salons do them, look on Google (or your favorite search engine).<br /><br />Who thought this was a great idea? And, these HAVE to be the LARGEST sizes for the particular “nails” I’ve seen. These really are a fancier version of the Lee and Wet N’ Wild from the late 1980’s/early 1990’.<br /><br />What’s worse? Even the PACKAGING states: 24<br /><br />Did they not think anyone would notice that detail?<br /><br />I’ll admit, these are pretty. And, thinking it was a HALF package, I contacted Amazon for a return/replacement. I cancelled the replacement, but I am returning these. As I told the rep – they’re pretty useless as they are. There is NO way I can use these. I would, at MINIMUM, only get 4 nails worth of coverage. For this price? Nope. Not at all. And, I feel sorry for those who do have to pay.<br /><br />In addition, the nearly $16 price tag (excluding sales tax) for 12 nails? Unreasonable. In my case, I’d need TWO (2) sets which would run $32. For that price – I might as well just wear a mask, go to the salon, and have them do it for me. My nails would definitely last two weeks, and I wouldn’t have to do them myself.<br /><br />I will not be getting these again and DO NOT recommend them.

3.0,Not so Starry,"Thank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set – I had to get it.<br /><br />I don’t know about others’ experiences – mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little “gel pots”. I remembered what my nail techs used to use – small make-up brushes – and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments – I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn’t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven’t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I’m not too unhappy with it. It’s not something I would likely purchase again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Et9ustyTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Et9ustyTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Et9ustyTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WsRox0EfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WsRox0EfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WsRox0EfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y6Hn1YJyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y6Hn1YJyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y6Hn1YJyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B086W18W1W,B086W18W1W,AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,1600511910044,0,False

But it did not absorb into my skin. After fifteen minutes, my face was still sticky and tacky. No way would I go to sleep like that, my face would stick to the pillow.<br /><br />So I washed the mask off, which was a disappointment since it’s supposed to be a “non-wash off mask.” My skin was a little softer, but having to wash my face because it was still sticky defeats the purpose of a mask that I’m supposed to be able to wear to sleep.",[],B0B34JJ8SR,B0B34JJ8SR,AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ,1664749716828,0,False

4.0,Looks cool and works well,"The look of the Lassie hair dryer is what caught my eye first. It just looks cool! I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won’t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn’t move easily, so there’s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn’t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I’ve used.

The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place.

3.0,Aloe Vera Gel,"This Aloe Vera Gel by Sdara Skincare takes a few minutes to fully absorb into my skin. I worried it would leave behind a sticky feeling, since I could feel it on my arm the whole time it took to dry. But once the gel finally absorbed, I couldn’t feel any residue left behind. I didn’t notice much of any scent either, which is another positive for me.<br /><br />The gel is clear; the plastic bottle is amber colored to help keep light out. I wish the bottle had a flip top or squeeze lid instead of a screw off cap.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is what gives me pause. I’m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice. The product description mentions “we perfected our serum by enriching with Vitamin E, & Citric Acid for improved nutrient absorption.” I don’t see Vitamin E listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I will probably end up using this aloe vera gel to make hand sanitizer.

This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I’ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one.

5.0,Happily Surprised,"I was a bit skeptical before trying because I find most hair masks to be more hype than anything else. This one however was great for my long thick wavy mess of a head of hair.

My hair felt hydrated without being weighted down, and wasn't left straw like which has happened to me in the past when I try to deep condition. I can usually go about 3-4 days between shampoos and didn't find myself needing to wash my hair any sooner than that. Obviously, if you shampoo more often on the regular you will have a different result than me. But basically it didn't leave my hair feeling dirty the next day.<br /><br />My process: I shampooed and then like most masks and conditioners I kept it away from my roots and only applied it from the midshaft to my ends (otherwise I end up with oily roots). Then I waited... and waited... and waited. Since I was reviewing the product I wanted to make sure I waited the full 10 mins to give it a chance. I was out of stuff to wash and shave after about 3 min so the last 7 were pretty boring. In the future I will probably only wait 5 min. I didn't apply any other conditioner other than my normal heat protector I spritz onto towel dried hair. Blow-dried as usual and the results let me skip the flat iron.<br /><br />I was pretty please.

At most it removed a top layer of dead skin making my skin feel softer (and dryer), but after rechecking my pores with a magnifying mirror (if you want to hate yourself buy one and then freak out at your skin, lol) there was no real difference. The before and after of my pores under the mirror were nearly identical.<br /><br />So all that work and annoyed skin for nothing.

Goes on shimmery purple, wipes off to a pinky / coraly / red. Stays all day.  I usually use it under other lipstick so when the lipstick fades there is still color there.  I have sensitivities to chemical and toxins and this does not seem to bother me that I immediately see.  Overall ... no regrets.

4.0,Lip applicators,"[[VIDEOID:5c532f5f5d94b55721fdf6748ddcc641]] I want you to try these for two reasons, first of all because I often make my own DIY cosmetics, including lip balms and glosses. These applicators are perfect to use with those.<br />Also, have you ever found that perfect shade of lipstick that you can't live without, only to find that it's been discontinued? These applicators help get every last bit of lipstick out of a tube so that you can enjoy it longer.<br />As you can see, the colors are pretty bright. I think that these would look more upscale in more muted colors, and if that's what you're going for, I would suggest getting the other color option in these. To be honest, what I would prefer, is if they were paper or wood instead of plastic. A little more environmentally friendly.<br />Still, they're good for what they are. The doe-foot tip Is slanted, just like with your favorite tubed liquid lip products. They are fuzzy, so they hold the lip product.<br />Makeup artists, as well as their clientele, will appreciate that these can be used once and then tossed.

5.0,Great for DIY...,"Not only are these sheets good for do-it-yourself masks, but they're fabulous at making any good serum a high-end mask.<br />What I like to do is open one of the individual packets and pull out the tablet, which is a compressed mask. And then, I take very hot water in order to get it to open up. After cleansing my face, I will load it with serum, and then put the warm mask over my face. It's easy to pat it into your skin to make it stay.<br />Lean back and relax, I generally do it for half an hour.<br />Remove the mask and gently massage the remaining serum into your face, and continue with your facial routine of moisturizer, sunscreen, whatever you use next.<br />So, whether you dip them in pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, or whatever your DIY routine is, or you use a prepared serum from your favorite brand, these are convenient, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive.<br />I especially like the individual packaging because they stay sanitary. I can pop a couple of them in my makeup bag and always be ready to go on any adventure that requires an overnight stay.<br />Thanks for reading.",[],B09NXZJV2J,B09NXZJV2J,AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,1647542575282,0,False

5.0,Vintage GLAMOUR in RED,"From pin-up girls to starlets, from old Hollywood movie queen royalty to the girls at the automat, certain red lipsticks have dominated makeup counters for decades.<br />This is one of them.<br /><br />Everything about this lipstick, except for the modern wearability, is vintage glamour. The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick. It's really hard buying such things online, especially when it comes to luxury brands like this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41toY-cdT4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41toY-cdT4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41toY-cdT4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HHPCZruEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HHPCZruEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HHPCZruEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B005AL5H9S,B005AL5H9S,AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,1644020283932,5,False

There's a little bit of a natural aroma of the ingredients but it is not offensive. It smells like just about every other fragrance-free product The big difference is that this one is way more effective than most other products of this type that I've tried.

I'm thrilled to be in the percent that it did.<br />It has some of the same chemical components as Szechuan pepper, which has got to be safer than the botulism in Botox, right?<br /><br />Paracress is almost unheard of outside of Brazil. This will be our little secret!<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s. I've always taken care of my skin and stayed out of the sun, so I probably have fewer wrinkles than most people my age, but trust me, I've got them.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will help you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to make the rather substantial investments in this product. It's definitely a risk since it doesn't work for everyone. And I can't stress enough that it's not going to be super dramatic change.

5.0,Good for Mature Skin,"Although I'm not thrilled that this didn't have a safety seal on it, the cream itself is very good. It's a heavy cream, despite the company identifying it as being light and whipped. It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true. Even in this dry area, my face feels hydrated all day when I use this cream.<br />It contains milk protein, yogurt extract, blueberry extract, rice protein, and a host of other skin-loving ingredients.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this product. It is indeed generously sized at 3.4 oz, and it has a very high quality ingredients.

5.0,Like a Peach Bellini for your Face!,"Do you like champagne cocktails? This one smells like a combination of peach and champagne, and even looks like it!<br />It comes out like a gel. It's activated by water, so after washing your face, leave your face damp and put a thin layer of the gel quickly all over your face. Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use the appropriate products for that skin type. I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you. If you leave a mild castile soap, which is so gentle, on your face for any length of time, skin will be irritated.<br />Made in the USA, from Tonica Skin in Marblehead Massachusetts.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to try this fun mask. It really does leave your skin feeling and looking energized, but it's a bit of an investment. Nice splurge for a spa night, and because the product comes out via a pump, it's going to be sanitary for all the participants.<br />It's going to make for some really fun and Instagram worthy photos!<br /><br />xxoo<br /><br />PS, my 'spa night' pal doesn't look too impressed 😆","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819OMKqH0YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819OMKqH0YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819OMKqH0YL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TVtfdkgEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TVtfdkgEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TVtfdkgEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08VKQY815,B08VKQY815,AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,1616359387784,4,False

After you remove it, put the top back on and separate the light unit from the jar.<br />The red LED light will be activated by pressing against your skin. Does that light actually do anything, or is it a gimmick?<br />There are a number of high-priced red light units on the market. They were first used in dermatologist offices and med spas. When they first came out, I had a red Tanda unit. This is exactly the same concept, and yes, you will have a slight difference.<br />The amount of cream gone in the jar has been for about 10 applications. I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage. If you suffer with sinus headaches, this action is very good at offering some relief.<br /> The cream is very lightly fragranced with a fresh scent. It's a gel or mousse type of cream.<br />After purchasing this, you can get the cream refill.<br /><br />So much cheaper than buying an LED light device like a Tanda.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+KP+04LjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+KP+04LjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+KP+04LjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Bb6ThTLmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Bb6ThTLmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Bb6ThTLmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81osqjkU0cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81osqjkU0cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81osqjkU0cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B083BCSQGN,B083BCSQGN,AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,1616003965064,0,False

Not just because of the taste, but it helps her to totally relax and even sleep throughout the night. Other teas and sleep formulations such as melatonin and valerian supplements just don't do the trick.<br />For me, it's more about the delightful taste. Slightly floral, slightly sweet. Yes, it does relax me and is helpful as part of a nighttime ritual, but not as much as my spouse. We both love it but for different reasons.<br /><br />And I just adore the look of the canister.

4.0,Damaged or do it yourself? Is it cruelty free....,"Feathers can be a little controversial. Rest assured that these are cruelty free! I used to have a peacock as a pet. He shed those beautiful tail feathers every year, and even though he is long gone I still have some of his gorgeous plumes. Peacock feathers are not harvested from the animal, you simply pick them up as they are naturally shed.<br />This set arrived in a plastic bag. When I pulled the pieces out, there were three peacock feather pieces and one headband. Each feather piece has a rhinestone accent at the bottom. One is all rhinestone, one is a pearl surrounded by rhinestones, and one is a London blue stone surrounded by rhinestones.<br />Of the two larger pieces, one has an alligator clip hot glued onto the felt backing, and one has a strip of grossgrain ribbon glued to the back. Although I'm not sure, I suspect that it was at one time glued to the headband, or they leave it to the consumer to glue it to the headband. I tried to push the end of the headband through the middle of the ribbon, thinking that perhaps it could slide on, but it is glued completely, you can't slide it onto the headband.<br />The smaller piece also has an alligator type clip of the same size as the larger clipped piece. They stay beautifully in your hair and are actually comfortable.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this a glamor or fashion accessory set, it's definitely a costume set that would be great for a roaring twenties party. Each one would also be a fun addition to a hat. I wear a lot of hats and love to adorn them with scarves and feathers.<br /><br />The following is not part of my review but it is a kind of funny peacock story. naturally, when guests came over they wanted to see him with his tail spread out in beautiful peacock glory. They only open up like that when they're trying to impress someone, and he certainly was never impressed by any of my guests. At the time I also had a miniature pig. That peacock was so in love with the pig that whenever she came near him he would spread out his feathers and shake them hoping she would notice and return his love. Of course that never happened, the pig could care less. But whenever we wanted to show him off to our friends, we would walk the pig over to him and he would immediately open his tail feathers with a great flourish! My friends and I were all impressed.

First, it simply covers more area. This is your head ---> a spheroid with protuberances. The 6-head shaver conforms to stuff like your ears and jawline better. 6-heads get the cutter closer to the nooks and crannies where those obnoxious thickets of long hairs might survive for a couple of days before someone points and say, ""Ewee!""<br /><br />The shaver is small and easy to hold. A charge lasts more than a month. Cleaning is easy. I use shaving cream to lubricate, just like a regular razor. A 'dry' shave in the shower might sound like an oxymoron, but you'll know what I mean when you use it once.<br /><br />I'm sold. Adds at least 5-minutes of goof-off time in my morning routine.

5.0,Nice value,"10-year-old super mega-brand vs. SOGUE:<br /><br />1. The SOGUE operates 10K VBM (vibrations/minute) faster. That's why I choose the SOGUE.<br /><br />2. Generic replacement brushes aren't interchangeable between the two. The SOGUE has a smaller shaft. The brushes are also smaller.<br /><br />3. The SOGUE comes with like a year's supply of brushes, unlike the super mega-brand. They are just a tad softer than I prefer. It took me some years to technically discriminate my preferred bristle adjective (soft, medium, hard) for re-order. My brush changing rule is 'new brush for every recharge' as brushes are now so inexpensive. The charges on these toothbrushes have got to be the longest-lasting rechargeable device in the house. It seems like months go by on a charge.<br /><br />4. The SOGUE and brush are about a quarter smaller. It's a noticeable difference. After a minute of thought, I think smaller is likely better as your teeth and the spaces in between are much smaller than you think. Maybe it's getting in tighter corners.<br /><br />5. The SOGUE charges in like 2 hours vs. overnight for the super mega-brand.<br /><br />I was looking at the super mega-brand's newest models at the big-box store. The price is absurd given all the competition from suppliers like SOGUE. The latest super mega-brand models appear the same size as the SOGUE.

4.0,Really lovely detoxing bath soak,"This has an exceptionally refreshing fragranced with essential oils. Reading the ingredients, I was impressed that the ingredients have detoxifying qualities. It really showed in the experience of how it was to use the salts.<br /><br />Though the instructions said to use the entire bag, I was a little shocked by this because it's a lot of salt and also at the time of purchase, the product was listed at about $35, so it seemed way too luxurious to use the entire thing. However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub. It is beautiful, though.<br /><br />Overall if the price to you seems fair for a single bath, then I highly recommend this product. The quality level is great, it's just a matter of how much do you want to spend for a single bath.",[],B07Y2WSGVW,B07Y2WSGVW,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,1619969521861,0,False

I have tried a number of gel eye masks in the past and found them reasonably pleasant, but this one actually left my skin around my eyes notably moisturized and looking younger for the rest of the day after use.<br /><br />I just put these on in the morning right after my shower and did the rest of my facial and hair care routine, got dressed and by the time I was ready to greet my day, I took off the eye masks and moisturized, and the moisture that the eye masks held in actually seemed to take hold and reduce the fine lines that I usually have around my eyes from lack of sleep and having small children and a business to manage.<br /><br />The fragrance is very light and unobtrusive, and the experience of using these is very luxurious. I have tried other eye masks that did not fit very well around my eye area, but these were shaped very nicely.",[],B08888PNJX,B08888PNJX,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,1594604927414,0,False

I was really impressed that after only a few days of use, my sides of my fingers of already healed. I didn't expect anything like that, and while I usually prefer to use hand lotions that are scented in some exciting fashion, I am partial to smelling of cupcakes or essential oils, I'm happy to have this simple work horse of a hand cream if it's going to do such a great job.",[],B07J2QZBTP,B07J2QZBTP,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,1576806007460,0,False
4.0,Desktop Pro 2019 works great; upgrading an existing payroll subscription is awful,"Desktop Pro 2019 upgraded smoothly and easily with absolutely no issues. I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.",[],B07FZ5HZLM,B07FZ5HZLM,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,1556724639735,0,False

I am also using the retinol facial moisturizer as well as an ocean mineral toner and cleanser from this brand, and while I was seeing great results from the other products, this mask really supercharged the results. I look like I have had a full nights sleep, which I can assure you I have not!

5.0,A fantastic product at a fantastic price,"I’ve tried other brands of argan oil, and have been surprised that some of the brands almost seem more like canola oil or a neutral oil, to where I almost wondered if some of them are counterfeit. Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I’d like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.",[],B007WFZ0XI,B007WFZ0XI,AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ,1396737905000,4,False

The clamp stand alone is worth $6.<br /> The head has a hole in the bottom to attach it to a tri-pod (Wig stand) if you have one but if you don’t that’s ok, just use the included clamp which easily attaches to any table.<br />  The hair feels good and for the price it’s great for hats, glasses, barrettes, earrings, the possibilities are endless.<br />  This is more than fine for beginners of ANY age.

Unless you have very light blonde hair, this is only going to provide grayish highlights. That is even taking into account the fact that I was quite generous with this cream. This is the first time I’ve tried a product like this, so I’m not sure how the other brands do, but this was just OK for me.

I try to treat it to moisturizing and repairing products in between bleachings so it doesn't look like a haystack. I have been shampooing, rinsing, towel drying and then sectioning and applying conditioner to my hair and leaving it over night, rinsing in the morning. This deep conditioning mask fell a little short of my expectations. It was an easy consistency to work with and worked well in to my hair. It smells minty and kind of herbal, that was really pleasant. My hair wasn't quite as quenched as I was hoping for, it feels more like a regular conditioner than a deep conditioning mask. I would definitely continue to use it as such, but I would not likely buy it again.",[],B07NCXVDD4,B07NCXVDD4,AHT6AM6BNIZUHFJB5V2M6XM72G7Q,1626303944638,0,False

I put the night pack on and went to bed. In the morning my skin felt so soft and was hydrated.

Once the liquid is on, you press the strip onto your face and then wait. It dries quicker than other pore strips I've used. After a little more than 5 minutes it was ready to peel. After peeling I looked at the strip and I could see the little hairs and stuff that came out of my skin. My nose feels smoother and looks clear. I wiped my face and my nose in particular with a toner pad and proceeded with a serum and moisturizer.

The big clumps of bubbles will pop and flatten on your face and when most of them were popped I wet my hands and rubbed the mask on my face.

3.0,"feet didnt peel fully, still had rough spots","This was my first time using a foot peel, so I feel like this product didnt provide enough information for first time users. Directions said to put booties on feet. I wasnt sure if i should take them out of the plastic, so i didnt because there was alot of liquid in them. The packets also said to not use if you are breastfeeding or pregnant so that was concerning - not sure what is in it or how it effects milk, but i still pump for my daughter. I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses. Idk if I was suppose to keep socks/ slippers off  during this time but it didnt completely work for me for whatever reason.

It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking.

3.0,It's just ok and has a few hiccups,I am always in need of a good curling iron and this one is okay but it is a little bigger than I would like for it to be. I really love all the settings this one has. This has two buttons that control the temperature up or down and it has a little window to show what the current temp is. The maximum temperature is 350 and it reaches that rather quickly. It has a switch that controls the speed of the twirl low or fast. Then there is a button to control the direction you want to curl your hair left or right and it has a home button to return the iron to the correct home position. This has a flipper that is about an inch to start your twirl but it leaves crease marks in your hair that cannot be corrected unless you re-wet it and start all over. It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn.

3.0,Pretend play toy,"For the price I find it hard to give this set many stars. There are two packs of nail polish, so you do get ten small bottles. However, there's like 8 colors to choose from because glitter and pink are duplicate. One teal is dried up and can't be used. Does take a long time to dry up. I wouldn't consider this a beauty item, instead, it's pretend play toy 100%. The stickers are extremely tiny and difficult to remove. When I tried to remove it from the package a couple stickers fell off of the plastic film. I did like how there's no strong odor to it and feels safe if my kids want to play with these.

They are not kidding. Although it goes on smooth and creamy it is very drying. The velvet finish is nice but it dries slowly, smudges and transfers. It does not withstand eating and drinking. But my main objection is that it is very drying.

4.0,Use a Light Hand,Like most of these product it is a tad fussy and messy. Practice definitely makes perfect and less is more. the dark brown color is pretty good.

I tried it without any spray or holding solution. It adhered fine. The dry particles do brush off without staining. It doesn't run down your face if you sweat but removes easily with shampoo. There is definitely a learning curve to application and it is important to get a close match to your natural color. 3.5,[],B075M9L47N,B075M9L47N,AH665SQ6SQF6DXAGYIQFCX76LALA,1522016370246,0,False

However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free.

5.0,great if you know what  you are doing,"I think these are a great idea.  I need to practice more with it and adjust the size of the lashes.  My initial attempts were a little messy and it is strange having the weight on your lids.  I never could get the hang of the glue on lashes, so I was hoping these were easier.  If you regularly use liquid liner, these will be easy for you to use.  The hardest part is getting the liner on smooth and straight.  Once it is on, the lashes stick very well to the magnetic bits in the liner.  Also, they come off fairly easily when pulled.  Potentially, it means you could accidentally pull them off if you play with your lashes or rub your eyes.  But they do stay on well, without touching.<br /><br />The lashes are a standard length, so if your eyes are smaller or larger than standard, you may have to adjust - more for smaller than larger.

However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue.

3.0,Very thin lotion with an unpleasant initial fragrance,"I love trying different lotions, particularly those that have nice fragrance, but when I received this set, I almost threw it away!  I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The ""lotion"" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (""Jam Blaster"") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.",[],B08M9TJ3NJ,B08M9TJ3NJ,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,1610408668285,0,False

4.0,Somewhat helpful for improving lashes,"I have been using this product for several weeks now.  I choose the option for the ""mascara brush"" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.",[],B08J7R5HHX,B08J7R5HHX,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,1607024174411,0,False
3.0,"Decently longevity and appearance, but some shades not wearable","This lipstick set comes in 2 sets of 5, Set A and Set B.  I wound up only opening the ""A"" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the ""B"" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is ""Almost Friday,"" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept ""Blush for Me,"" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, ""Red for Me,"" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31oOOvduIOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31oOOvduIOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31oOOvduIOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0839FY8JG,B0839FY8JG,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,1603576496847,0,False

5.0,Really seems to work for me!,"My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.

3.0,No noticeable results after over a month - UPDATED 11/9/14,"NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.",[],B00KW4EF6Y,B00KW4EF6Y,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,1413334024000,0,False
4.0,"Yes, these really work...but keep a few things in mind","After very minimal and barely noticeable success with whitening toothpastes and gels, I finally decided to give Crest Premium Whitestrips a try.  Previously, I had found the cost to be prohibitive, but the fact that $5 or $7 coupons are offered in our Sunday paper with some regularity made the price a bit easier to swallow.<br /><br />Just like the commercials say, I definitely did begin to see some improvement after about three days.  I would describe the effect as more of a lightening than a whitening per se:  the darker yellow spots on my teeth began to fade and to become less apparent.  Now, after using the product as prescribed for a week, the color of my teeth is clearly improved; I wouldn't say that my teeth are bright white, but they are definitely more of an ivory or a paler yellow color.  According to the package insert, you can immediately begin a second course of treatment for even better whitening effects, but I haven't yet decided if I want to lay out another $30 in order to do this.  Also, I should mention that the effect is not so dramatic thta anyone has noticed (UNLIKE in the commercials!).<br /><br />Now for the caveats.  First of all, I found these strips to be a bit difficult to use.  It can be hard to remove the strips from the protective backing without them becoming mangled, and it is very easy to get the gel on your fingertips (which causes a temporary whitening effect).  Also, the strips are not ideally shaped for your mouth, and I found that they covered my front eight teeth only.  Finally, while the top strip adhered fairly well, I found that the bottom strip was more tricky and tended to slide around, especially if I moved my mouth at all.  The only solution I found to this was to wear the strips while commuting to work, which luckily gave me a 30-minute period when I did not need to talk.  Otherwise, it can be difficult to find a good time to wear the strips, as the insert information advises against wearing them immediately after you brush your teeth, while sleeping, and while you are eating/drinking.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem with the taste of the strips:  I could not detect anything while wearing them, and after taking them off, I thought that the gooey paste left behind was virtually tasteless.  I did experience some sensitivity in a lower tooth which I had capped over 20 years ago.  Although this sensation went away in time, it was uncomforable enough to make me cut the lower strip to fit around this particular tooth.<br /><br />In summary, I did see clear--although not miraculous--results from this product and I would be willing to try the strips again, especially if the price were to come down a bit.  Ultimately, I would rate Crest Whitestrips three and a half stars, as there is definitely room for improvement.",[],B0001ZI0BU,B0001ZI0BU,AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,1093281730000,30,False

4.0,DIY Clay Mask Skincare Kit,"This is a DIY clay mask kit that could use better branded packaging. It comes in a generic box with everything tossed into it, which makes it feel like a random assortment of products rather than a unified kit. It includes two different but reputable brands (Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and an Indian Clay Mask) as well as an assortment of mixing supplies (pink bowl, measuring spoons, spatula, brush). The pink plastic supplies are dollar quality and feel very cheap while the ACV and clay mask are full size products that can be used together as indicated on the DIY recipe or on their own. The mask jar doesn't specify that ACV must be used so I assume you can use it on your own or have it diluted with water. The ACV can be used for many other applications including drinking for general health.<br /><br />Overall I like the quality of the two products - the other supplies felt unnecessary and extraneous, but I guess you can charge more by including them. But I'd rather just use my own bowls. Overall it's a good quality kit and it gives you a nice at-home facial. I tried it once and my skin does look brighter than usual.

It consists of coffee colored crystals. You get a lot - about 8.8 ounces worth. I rubbed it on my legs and under the soles of my feet. There is a slight oiliness to the scrub that you often don't get from other scrubs - it's probably from the essential oils. After rinsing it off, I felt my dry skin feel much softer and hydrated. It really provides a nice semi-spa experience.<br /><br />The price, however, is off the charts. I've used many scrubs and I'm not sure this one is worth the cost.

The towelettes aren't particularly strong either - I tore one just pulling it out of the package. There is also no alcohol in the formula so it's best used for wiping your face rather than disinfecting your hands - for that you're better off using something with alcohol in it to kill the germs. As a result, this bundle of towelettes has limited usefulness - it's good for a light face cleaning or to finish the job left by a facial cleanser.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's paraben free and has no scent to irritate my allergies.

The gua sha stone isn't perfect (it has several small nicks across its surface) but since you use the edges of the stone and not the middle, it doesn't affect the function.

Either this happened at the factory and the stone was still sent to me damaged, or it happened during shipping.

It's a small, thoughtful box for someone who needs some downtime. The candle smells great and is small enough to take with you on a trip. The other items are TSA friendly.

5.0,Pretty Comb But Not Space Saving,"This comb is made with thick wood - while it's not heavy (it's surprisingly lightweight), it's chief disadvantage is that it takes up more room in a drawer. I'm not sure what is to be gained by its thickness (the teeth, after all, are normal) other than to exaggerate the fact that it's made of wood. I think it's made to be more of a display piece than a functional one, so if you have space to display it on a dresser table, it's certainly worthy of that. It has a nice design and comes across as well made.

It comes with not only the usual rose quartz roller with the questionably useful Gua Sha stone (personally I found it useless for skin issues but they nevertheless include it in all these sets) but a small roller, which you almost never see anywhere. It's the perfect size for travelling and works just as well as the larger version.<br /><br />However, the larger roller has spikes on one end, which I don't like at all and which they had kept the usual smooth end. It seems made for microdermabrasion which is painful to use and which I don't believe works at all for beautifying your face, only hurting it.

4.0,"Korean Beauty Product Filled with ""Pearls""","I've never heard of this brand before but the price is high and it's considered a premium beauty product, made in Korea. The question is, it is worth the price?<br /><br />First, kudos to the packaging. The Glam Pearl Radiance Capsule serum is full of pearls (whether they are real or not is unclear). The bottle is filled with tiny ""pearls"" suspended in a gel solution that reminds me of bubble tea. The serum that comes out is supposedly infused with fermented pearl extract. In Asia, eternal beauty is often represented by pearls and so they're attributed with some mystical powers of youthful rejuvenation and powers of preservation. So it goes with this serum - the lotion has a shimmering effect mimicking that of pearls. It is very smooth and creamy, and leaves my skin glowing.<br /><br />Whether this serum has actual anti-aging effects is questionable. My wrinkles haven't gone away at all. I've been using it only a few weeks and will update my review if I see any significant change to my face. As it is, it's a pricey but aesthetically pleasing beauty product that will make you feel like you will get a pearl-like beauty just by using it.",[],B08D7TLV21,B08D7TLV21,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1615641819067,0,False

It reminds me of what you might get at a hotel. Unfortunately I absolutely hated the scent. It literally made me want to gag. It isn't floral or sweet but some kind of awful chemical smell.

The price is low but then you get what you are paying for - the quality is average - better than a 99 cent discount store but made of a cheap synthetic fiber that doesn't feel that durable or long term.

Since I don't travel much anymore, I felt a bit nostalgic when I saw this bag of six soaps. Each one is tear-shaped and about the size of a hotel travel soap. I really like the scent and it lathers well - best of all it's made without the toxic chemicals most mainstream soaps and body washes are filled with. It has a refreshing scent, thanks to being made with essential oils.<br /><br />It's advertised as a soap that ""boosts immunity"" but I find that laughable - everyone is reminded constantly to wash your hands as a way to prevent the spread of COVID and that action, you could say, ""boosts"" your immunity given that COVID is no match for soap.

It comes in a relatively small caninster and it comes out like shaving foam, only it's for the body and not for the face. It feels great and helps clear my stuffed sinuses. The scent is ""mint and rosemary"" but I feel like it's mostly mint. It's a step up above your ordinary shower gel but it won't likely last as long, as it's hard to tell how much of the bottle you are actually using since it's not liquid. Except for that caveat, I liked this.",[],B08KGVBW41,B08KGVBW41,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1603414240825,0,False
5.0,Great for travel,"I usually pack travel size bottles of facial cleanser. This package comes as 20 individually wrapped towelettes, not dissimilar to what you might find in a hotel or airline first class amenity kit. They look like dry wipes but once you add water, it suds up really well and is perfect for washing your face free of makeup. It can also be reused as a regular wipe after the first use, just hang up and let dry. There isn't much of a scent, which is fine by me as strong fragranced wipes are bad for my allergies. Overall a nice product though not the most environmentally friendly with all the packaging.",[],B083BGJ4P9,B083BGJ4P9,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1603022205313,0,False
4.0,Gold Themed Beauty Box,"This ""facial kit"" has all the items you'd expect to get in a spa gift basket, only it's shipped in a cardboard box reminiscent of subscription boxes. The main difference is that it's a one-time deal, no subscription needed, and all the items are grouped together by theme and color. I ordered the ""gold"" theme and was a little disappointed that not all the items are gold colored (the eye mask is blue) and there's a mix of drugstore items with some more luxurious feeling ones.<br /><br />I'll start with the good. The box is very cute, with the words ""It's a great day to love your face"" greeting you when you open the box. Inside you get a five count box of sheet Masks that contain retinol, a generous and thick box of facial wipes, a Gold under-eye pad to reduce lines and puffiness, and a gold Lip Mask (I've never used a ""lip mask"" before so this seems a little bizarre, if fun). The blue eye mask is filled with gel beads so you can use it hot or cold, and the cheapest and least impressive items are the ""facial buff"" (a pear-shaped sponge that looks like something you'd clean your pots with) and a  ""facial cleansing brush"" that looks a little cheap but is nevertheless useful.<br /><br />The main thing that was missing was some packing peanuts or confetti, as the items were tossed into the box hither and thither with NO padding, whereas other gift baskets and boxes typically include some stuffing so that the items are more artfully displayed. This one wasn't, so if I were giving this to someone as a gift, I'd certainly add it so the items wouldn't arrive in a jumble.

5.0,Gorgeous Nails Using This Set,"I already have a number of gel nail polishes but I love the iridescent glitter of these nail polishes. They are very sparkly and the gel lasts a long time.

4.0,Great Travel Set of Curated Caudalie Products,"I love gift sets like these, which are great for sampling expensive beauty products so that you don't waste money on full size products that don't work for your skin. This is the secret behind the success of Ipsy and Birchbox. You get five travel sizes of the most popular and bestselling items sold by Caudalie: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixer. The eye cream was nice but I didn't see any effect on my wrinkles; the radiance serum made my skin feel great, as did the moisturizing sorbet. I think I liked the cleanser the most and the beauty elixer the least (it didn't do much for me). Considering that each one is costly for a full size version, it's great to be able to know which one is right for me before purchasing. To top it off, it comes in a beige canvas cosmetic travel bag decorated with grapes. Very nice.",[],B085NYYLQ8,B085NYYLQ8,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1596502619036,1,False
5.0,Love the Scent and The Shape of the Bottle,This is a striking perfume bottle to display on your dresser - the bronze-colored mannequin figure has a sexy pose and you grip her torso when you pick up the bottle to spray.

They feel sturdier than the swabs that have plastic handles - I use these to clean my ears but also to dab Listerine along my gumline to help fight gingivitis. It feels solidly made and the swabs are tightly wound rather than soft and flabby like cheaper swabs.

She dislikes the scent (very medicinal) but she feels refreshed after wiping herself with one of these. Each one is individually sealed which is convenient and hygienic, versus those where you have a resealable package and risk drying out the other towels if it's not sealed properly. I will also use these when I go hiking or camping. They are biodegradable so it's also better for the environment.

The scent is a little strong but it's pleasant. I think this product could be used by both men and women though it's obviously intended for men. This product is made in England and the graphics are pleasant to look at it - it has a quaint Victorian vibe about it.

5.0,Soft and Flexible to Wear,This headband is soft and flexible. It keeps my hair from falling into my eyes when I do my morning routine of washing my face. It's also great for holding your hair back after you shampoo and making it easier to style. It can also be washed after every use and dries quickly because the material isn't too thick.

4.0,"Small Wipes, You Need At Least Two to Remove It All","The wipes are great but they are on the small side. Depending on how much makeup you wear on a typical day, you'll need at least two to get all your makeup removed. I reserve one for the eyes and one for the face. So I expect I'll use up this package relatively quickly. It doesn't irritate my face and it doesn't leave my skin dry, which is a plus. So it's all good except for the size of the wipes.",[],B084XRQLMT,B0914JBBTV,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1586014147800,0,False

It's held securely in place by the suction cups.<br /><br />This is a nice gift for anyone who takes a lot of baths. However, if you only do so occasionally, you might find that the size of this pillow might be a deterrent. It's not space saving and does take up a lot of room for storage.

3.0,Turns the Tips of Your Nails Yellow,"UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses.",[],B07S7G1WPT,B07S7G1WPT,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1568059668741,1,False
4.0,Simple to Use and Lightweight for Travel,"I just came back from a trip and packed this curling iron in my luggage. It's described as ""travel"" but the length is about the same as other curling irons. The main difference is the weight - it's so light and functions as both a straightener and curler, so it does save space in my luggage. It works very well. I had never heard of this brand before but the curler works just as well as more expensive brands. To change from a curler to a straightener, you simply press the buttons ""S"" for Straightener or ""C"" for Curling! So simple and easy to use.",[],B07K153R2B,B07K153R2B,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1566128170747,1,False

In addition, the microbeads don't dissolve easily and I had to rub the serum several times before they were absorbed by my face. I also recently learned microbeads are also bad for the environment because they can poison fish if they're disposed of in drains and end up in the ocean.

3.0,"Nice Facial Roller, But No Instructions for the Two Crystal Bottles","Jade facial rollers are everywhere these days and it's hard to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently. I would get it for the roller alone, but the lack of instructions prevent me from giving this set more than three stars.",[],B07JB4NJQ8,B07LCF4BK5,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1562420747485,0,False
3.0,"Vinegar Scent, Average Effectiveness","I like drinking apple cider vinegar but smelling it on my hair is a different story. While the scent dissipates I smell the vinegar when I first spray it on my fine, frizzy hair. The mist seemed to make it a little bit softer and smoother, but not to the point where I'd get this again. I prefer to use other anti-frizz products because I can't get past the slight vinegar smell. Add in the high price and I'm not getting it again.",[],B073GQ1B32,B0BG6WX4DH,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1561388851980,1,False
4.0,Reasonably Effective Flat Iron,"This flat iron is versatile in that it's effective on dry hair as well as wet - usually I avoid straightening my hair when it's dry out of fear that it will damage my hair. In this case I didn't notice any ill after effects - the Tourmaline Ceramic plates are designed to be softly reactive to your hair, so this may be the reason. The best advice I can give is to be aware of the heat settings - I typically use the lowest and work my way up depending on how my hair reacts.<br /><br />Like most flat irons by Parwin, it heats up fast and has a swivel cord. Given how many flat irons there are on the market, I would say this is OK in terms of what it does for the price. I wouldn't say it was exceptional but I like the versatility of the dry hair option.",[],B07DPMFTLY,B07DPMFTLY,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1552588643004,1,False

Most of them shimmer with glitter, which is really cool - you can mix and match the different colors to get just the right effect. No brush is included but it's easy enough to apply to your eyes with your fingers. The quality is pretty good - I didn't experience any eye irritation when I used this. Very nice gift for yourself or a friend.",[],B07DSC4X3K,B07DSC4X3K,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1545840940736,9,False

A courtesy card from the company thanking you for purchasing the product even includes a quote about how great mothers are from singer Stevie Wonder!<br /><br />Overall this is a very useful product that will save a parent money from taking your little one to the barber shop or hair salon. It works well and I can't see why it can't be used for an adult's hair as well, though the small size made it clear that is meant for a child's small head.",[],B07G23R7ZX,B07G23R7ZX,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1545766410447,3,False
4.0,Salon Quality Gel Manicures at Home,"This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.  And for those who like to change their polish often, preserving the same look for a week or two isn't a priority. So unlike you already have some sort of LED lamp, I would just stick to the normal gel polishes available out there.",[],B01KJPFO9W,B01KJPFO9W,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1542306619063,0,False
3.0,Lightens Your Face But Kind of Overpriced For What You Get,"This is a small bottle of powder that comes with a tiny spoon.  You dab a bit of the white powder into your hand and mix it with your regular moisturizer, which you then apply to your face. I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock.  My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation.  Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that has a lighter feel on your face. Otherwise, the price is kind of high for what you get.",[],B01MFC2Q8C,B01MFC2Q8C,AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,1485696013000,3,False

5.0,Peppermint and coffee scrub that I like the smell and on some of my dry areas,"Rub a Dub Scrub! A delightful shower treat. This organic body polish is nicely scented with coffee and peppermint. Typically I make my own from organic ingredients, so I am picky and compare. I was very happy with the Alexa coffee body scrub. The package is a nice size at 8 oz. It also would make a wonderful gift if you are needing a quality pampering for someone.<br /><br />You can just get your feet wet if you are doing a pedicure with it. All you have to do is get your body wet, or the particular area you are using it on. I put a smidgen between my fingers and only use it on key body dry areas. If you want to slather it all over that is ok too! I just like to make it last because it is nice on my skin. I have several dry eczema areas and dry areas on my feet.<br /><br />I have used other brands and had to transfer it into another container of my own, I love that with this one I didn't have to! It is not to cumbersome in the shower, the package is easy to open and close. The Alexa brand is made in the USA with organic all natural moisturizers. My skin is soft silky smooth with the combination of the great ingredients of dead sea salt, organic oils, organic coffee and organic shea butter. I used the scrub on my hands, feet, upper arms and legs. The scrub doesn't leave behind an oily residue, just a nice soft skin feeling. It's great for light exfoliating. Scrub, rub and rinse!

After about a month of searching, I've finally found one that is<br />- soft<br />- doesn't tangle<br />- and has a natural color.<br />Unfortunately, it's strong shine and the way the ends curl make it appear incredibly fake in most lights.<br />With that being said, it is possible to style the wig with a flat iron, though I wouldn't go over about 250 degrees--otherwise, it begins to fuzz up.<br />So that takes care of the unnatural curling.<br />For the shine, I tried applying baby power throughout and that helped some, but it still does looks a little too silky smooth (See photos with flash).<br />Note: I did have to cut the bangs; they were about 2 inches too long (better than too short though!).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61C8c4YenqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61C8c4YenqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61C8c4YenqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FjRRtbM5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FjRRtbM5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FjRRtbM5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eEDX5BQ-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eEDX5BQ-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eEDX5BQ-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jhvmH+RrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jhvmH+RrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jhvmH+RrL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkVna8PaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkVna8PaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkVna8PaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tweprRT6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tweprRT6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tweprRT6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ArnRqLAeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ArnRqLAeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ArnRqLAeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06XCNT987,B06XCNT987,AHA6LXI6FVWBVCXBPYWP7MCVFIUQ,1515393216551,0,True
5.0,Actually Works When Used Properly- Ask for a link to my video review,"Things I learned:<br />-DO NOT over massage<br />-Use the cream properly<br />-Use the massager properly<br />-use the cream right after. These products come in a pair for a reason.<br /><br />Alright, I'll get to the point. Does the product do what it says?<br />In so many words, yes, most definitely.<br />My experience with the products was as follows.<br />First, I mistakenly used the cream on my legs during my shower as a way of lubricating the massager.<br /><br />TIP: This is incorrect... I know that now.<br /><br />Luckily, I din't waste much and my experience with the brush was actually really great. Massaging is painless and since its manual, you get to choose the level of pressure you feel you ought to apply.<br />One caveat--do not over rub. I did so and ended up bursting my bum, waking up the following morning with bits of--what I assume was--busted blood cells. I even bruised a bit. Long story short, go easy on yourself and do not massage too often. I would suggest about four times a week as a maximum.<br /><br />The cream itself is nice. I've used it about 5 times now, and I can already so a minor difference. Although I generally attribute this to the massager, the cream does leave the skin feeling tighter for sure. It does remain sticky for a couple of seconds (about 45...less than a minute, not bad) but drys completely.<br /><br />My experience has taught me that, by using the correct products correctly, you can actually get rid of cellulite.<br /><br />Last and final point; I'm not sure how permanent this is, however, massaging and creaming really isn't that much of a hassle. Any hey, if it keeps the cellulite off...<br /><br />Disclaimer: Free for review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CxxaZXHUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CxxaZXHUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CxxaZXHUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SwWM3NPgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SwWM3NPgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SwWM3NPgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNsjrwERL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNsjrwERL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WNsjrwERL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YzOuRANoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YzOuRANoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YzOuRANoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51n7ApOL2wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51n7ApOL2wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51n7ApOL2wL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wWxjwM+tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wWxjwM+tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wWxjwM+tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xMttq6K+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xMttq6K+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xMttq6K+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ONLaXMexL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ONLaXMexL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ONLaXMexL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gzyGRuD6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gzyGRuD6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gzyGRuD6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01I5X3F14,B01I5X3F14,AHA6LXI6FVWBVCXBPYWP7MCVFIUQ,1470258006000,1,False

5.0,Surely is Rapid!,"I’ve used many different eye creams in the past. In choosing to take a chance on this one I was literally<br />shocked at what I witnessed upon applying this under my eyes. I wake with puffy eyes, semi wrinkles coming in at age 50. After cleansing my face I turn to this to work it’s magic. It only takes a very small amount to apply. I’ve never used the word shocked in a review but what I saw within a 2 minute period did just that. The area under my eyes instantly smoothed out & looked as if I had skin of a 20yo again. The longer I let it sit before applying my serum & moisturizer the more smoothing & softened the area became. This isn’t a harsh eye cream. I had no stinging, no bad reaction, it worked perfectly for my skin. There’s no scent to it. It comes nicely out of the dispenser. The smoothed & tightened area that I’ve clearly noticed remains this way even after the rest of my facial regime. I’ve never had anything like this before with truly how rapid it works on my skin upon applying. This morning I used it & moisturized my face only. What an amazing difference that again has lasted. Rapid Reduction it definitely is. A 1 ounce tube will last me awhile since a little goes a long way. Genuine quality with this cream & I highly recommend it.

5.0,Great Face Setting!,"Elizabeth Mott $et for Life Loose Setting Powder is the 1st type of powder that has kept my oily skin under control all day long. It’s a light powder that comes out of the container through little holes so I have control over how much powder I want in the top of the container where I pick up the powder with my makeup brush. The design is wonderful. It’s sheer & applies nicely with my discretion. It’s the last product I put on my face in the morning. I don’t wear foundation or any of that. After cleansing I use toner (not everyday) then my moisturizer with sunscreen & primer. Finally I’m complete this great face setting powder. I’ve never found anything that keeps my face in place before I found this. Hours later no oil can be seen on my face~and my skin is oily! Late afternoon I may use the face blotting tissues to set my face more, depending on where/what I’m doing. Even then little oil shows through. In the past I’ve used a matte powder which worked but not as good as this. My skin color would be considered beige in the matte powder so I was hesitant on this “Translucent” color but it blends in wonderfully. I don’t look too pale or too dark. I love it! This is my 2nd purchase & my 1st lasted a long time. So I’m set for life & I highly recommend it if you have oily skin.",[],B07871RLLG,B07871RLLG,AGPC7CWRQPMNQFXWLYJYQYF7DCQA,1599923524757,0,False

5.0,It is a great addition to my makeup vanity,This mirror is a blessing to have.  It is a great addition to my makeup vanity.  I love the way it looks just to sit out for decoration.<br />Mirror is light weight yet the base is heavy.  The mirror does turn over to have normal side then to flip it is magnified.  The best part of this mirror is it is LED illuminated.  It took 3 AA batteries which were supplied.  The toggle switch is on the base and when illuminated it gives that cool glow.  I love plucking my eyebrows with this mirror.  Easy to see and with the added light it works well.  The light is very vibrant and puts off a very nice glow.  Lights are on both sides.<br />I would consider all materials high quality by the apperance and by the weight.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this dual sided mirror.  It has been a great item added to my makeup collection.  Works well to sit on the vanity to give you an additional mirror for up close application and for the magnification.  I am not sure how I have lived my 32 years without a mirror like this to apply my makeup or pluck my eyebrows.<br /><br />I received this mirror for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

4.0,This is a good set of contouring colors,"This is a good set of contouring colors.  It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.",[],B019NBEIKY,B019NBEIKY,AHETDGASODBTH5UNKJMMGGE6M25Q,1456200305000,0,False

Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.

I was incredibly excited to try this product out after seeing the buzzfeed video with them using it.<br />When I first opened the package, I was a bit shocked at how big of a bottle it was but how it seemed like barely half was full. When attempting to squeeze is out it was very much like trying to get the last of a product out of a container just as you're about to run out of it. All air, very little inside.<br />I did a small test area just to see if there was any kind of crazy reaction and I didn't have any issues. Goes on, peels off, wash away any little flakes that don't peel with it. However, when I went back to do a full mask I noticed that even though I had totally sealed it up tight, within about 20 minutes a massive amount of the product had leaked into the lid. I cleaned it up so it didn't solidify and placed the bottle upside down, so the lid was facing up instead.<br />The full mask itself went on nice and easy, just like the test. When I peeled it off, I did notice my skin felt fresher but it didn't really pull anything out. I checked the peeled off mask itself and while it had plenty of little itty bitty hairs from my face, nothing really noticeable. I checked out problem areas in the mirror and they looked basically the same, maybe with some blackheads and things closer to the surface and drawn up so they could be removed. The effect was minimal though and pretty disappointing.<br />I'll finish it off since there isn't much left and there is no point in not using it, but I won't be buying any more after this.",[],B00DRHQXNG,B00DRHQXNG,AHG7SPSVGONKNCMS4YALAH2LYMTQ,1481984262000,0,True

3.0,50/50 Chance you get a good bottle,"Doesn't matter where you buy them, who you buy from, etc.  There is a 50% chance you get a good bottle of polish and a 50% chance you get a bad one.  I have 3 bottles from 3 different places, 3 different colors (blue white and black) and the blue one is good, the white one is meh, and the black one is completely useless.  The white and black have bent brushes, and the white polish is a bit dried out but not the worst, kind of reminds me of using white-out before they changed the formula and it got all watery and they changed to a sponge applicator from a brush.  The black one is awful - it's literally just clumps of dried out polish with some occasional damp spots.  The blue one is okay, the polish is alright, but I wouldn't recommend using the brushes that came with these but buying a separate skinny brush for line work or whatever it is you want to do.<br /><br />I should mention I have been using them to fix an enameled piece of jewelry as opposed to doing nails, as that's what the jeweler recommended (nobody local repairs enamel resin and buying enamel is very expensive and you end up with a ton leftover), so a jeweler I trust recommended nail polish with a good resin sealant and that's what I've been doing.

A pleasant surprise this second time around is that some of the new growth is coming in my natural black rather than silver or white as it had been.

4.0,Pretty good coverage for a powder,"First time in 20 years I've transitioned from a liquid concealer to a powder, the coverage is obviously not the same but this is by far the best performing powder I've ever had. I'm lucky in that my face at it's not-the-most-tan tiny works well with the light color but I can see how the limited color choices can be a deal breaker for some. It's smooth and not cakey, it blends well, feels weightless, and stands up to sweating and long work days with great shine prevention and it doesn't come off easily (a little when you blow your nose etc). I do not like the porcelain doll look and this works well for me for evening out tones.  I am 35 and have very sensitive skin, several minor facial scars, and occasional adult acne and this doesn't have any negative effects on my skin at all. It washes off easily with gentle face wash. It allows for a few spot touches of stick concealer, blends well, and holds well. Mine arrived with no breaks/cracks and the sponge works well. I really like the protective inner plastic case between the powder and the lid and sponge. Will buy again! I previously used Revlon, Covergirl, Neutrogena, and JUNGSAEMMOOL Essential Star-cealer Foundation which I was happy with the first time and then the following two were slimy and just not working well. For reference my current face tone is a revlon 300-310, a covergirl 705-710, and Starcealer Light. After peak summer I'm a more 310-320, 710-715, and Starcealer Medium (almost, its still a little dark for me).",[],B071J8QSJ5,B07MX218RF,AHSO67ZJNYBYIVEIYDHF7QMCBUJQ,1537972841173,2,True

5.0,"love, love, love this!","I bought this oil after using their avocado oil. Life-Flo is a great brand. I've never had issues with any of their products. This oil is food grade, cold pressed. It is a lighter weight than their avocado oil, but it works just as well. I use this on my son who is two to help his skin retain moisture (he has severe eczema). I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp. His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized. I use it on his scalp also once a week. I massage it through his hair and let it soak in while he's playing in the tub and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal. It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper. It doesn't have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him. It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side. We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months so it lasts a while compared to a gel baby oil (we go through one of them a month if we use it).  A little bit goes a long way. This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil. For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  If it's for eczema we have tried it. He's had eczema since he was 3 months old and I feel like we finally found a product that I know is safe to use, it's all natural, no chemicals, and it's within budget.",[],B0055FF3SE,B0055FF3SE,AEADZSFKXHLZ6L4AL7CL4BDWO6WQ,1391718152000,14,True

5.0,"LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!","I purchased this product after severely cutting my heel with one of those blades used to cut the calluses from your feet. My husband had warned me of the dangers of using blades, and I've cut my feet several times. I read many reviews on this product and others before purchasing. It came in 2 days and had a charge when it arrived.  I keep it plugged in so it's ready whenever my husband or I are needing to use it. I'm very pleased with this product, and very happy that I purchased this.  It works very well and does a great job, and I use it at least once a week to keep my feet really soft. My husband also uses it about once a week also, to keep his feet smooth.  He was shot in the foot and the bullet fragments are still in his foot, and he gets calluses where the fragments are in his foot. I also purchased the extra rollers, but haven't had to change the original one out yet.  Those who complained about this product must not have used it properly.  When using don't press down thinking that extra pressure will help, it's not designed to be used like that.  Just lightly touch the area you want to treat and the file will definitely work well. For those who have a lot of hard calluses, you might want to either soak your feet first to soften the skin,  or use it everyday for a couple of days until you get the best results.  You don't want to over do it because you may cause your feet to be sore. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this wonderful gadget to anyone.  It will definitely save you a lot of money on getting pedicures elsewhere!",[],B013QBNX58,B013QBNX58,AHDH4QSAKYLNARJL5KWJWZRWXMZA,1453997646000,5,True

My skin is normal to oily, but also sensitive, and cannot handle all of the oils in this product. It sort of just sits on top of my skin.<br />I really wish the company would have listed the ingredients, instead of pointing out the great ingredients that are in minute amounts. Aside from glycerin, the other touted ingredients are almost halfway down, or lower, on the ingredients list, or are not so skin friendly. Green tea is wonderful for your skin, but it is near the bottom of the ingredients list. Also, the type of vitamin C, Ascorbyl Palmitate, is not very skin friendly, and can actually be very irritating to sensitive skin, like mine.<br />This moisturizer may work well for those with very dry skin, but I would have liked to see the boasted about skin loving ingredients closer to the top of the ingredients list. Full transparency is always best, and will make customers happy. Listing some wonderful ingredients that are minimally effective in very small amounts, is a bit misleading.

4.0,Nothing spectacular. I have received more... for this price.,"This Hair Removal Device by Ulike just as well as a couple of other IPL devices I have that cost much less. It comes packaged nicely, though I kept trying to open the flat two-sided green piece that covers the accessory side. It doesn't open.<br />The device does look quite fancy, and I was interested in skin rejuvenation, which is in one of the photos (that is mentioned in the other listing that shows this exact same device). The instruction booklet contains about as much as the empty listing page that I ordered it from. That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake! If you like fancy boxes and a sleek-looking device, I would recommend this one.",[],B0BBG78CPP,B0BBG78CPP,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1664842264557,5,False

They also have great staying power, but can be washed away quickly with any cleanser.<br />My eyelids are naturally oily, so I have to add a wisp of translucent powder over top, so they won't stay tacky. They still keep the shimmer, too, which is not overdone. It is just right for my 51 year young self to wear and not look silly, just elegant.<br />I love this eyeshadow stick set! From the colors to the ease of use, it just works well. The colors would look beautiful on anyone's skin tone, and they are great for a busy schedule.

5.0,A Nail Tech's View: I really like this gel!,"The Builder Nail Gels Kit in Clear & Pink is medium to semi thin ~ especially if it is used in warm temperatures. It is nothing like polygel, though it includes a slip solution. The clear is really clear and the pink is nice, also, though I don't use colors a lot. This applies so easily for me, cures as expected, and looks great. I am even able to build an apex.<br />The brush and other accessories are sub-par, like what most inexpensive sets have. They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process. Then, they can replace them with better quality items.<br />The slip solution is confusing to be in a builder gel kit, though I find it great for wiping the sticky layer off the nails after application. It can also be used to clean the brush handle, and any other sticky places.<br />I am more than happy with the quality, viscosity, and end results I achieve with this builder gel.

5.0,Simply wonderful ingredients 👇! Feels lovely.,"This Hydro-Plumping Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a simple, yet a powerhouse serum. It has wonderful moisturizing, anti-aging, antioxidant, and calming ingredients that are top notch. There are several types of super moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid. It also has Green Tea, which is proven to be an excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial superstar.<br />This is a wonderful serum to use during your day or night routine. I like to apply it to damp, or well hydrated skin. Usually after applying a few layers of my toner. It applies and absorbs easily, and a little does go a long way. Any slight tackiness is taken care of after applying a good moisturizer to help lock in all the good stuff. It has a very light, hardly noticeable scent.<br />It really hydrates my skin and plumps my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks and feels better when using it. I have combination skin, but use Retin-A, which can be a bit drying and sometimes irritating. This serum really calms the irritation, yet enhances the anti-aging effects of the Retin-A.<br />This serum is a great every day serum. Especially for those who have sensitive and/or dry skin, but is beneficial for any skin type. It has great ingredients, and is not loaded with harsh chemicals, and provides so much good stuff for your skin. It is a simple, yet powerful serum.

3.0,"Very strong scent at first, but it disappears very quickly.","I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne ""Les Enfants"" in White Blossom. Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. If I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe or not, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive ""Cologne"" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this ""Baby Cologne"" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can.

4.0,A Nail Tech's View: A great sampler set. So fun!,"This is a great sampler set by KRISNICE. You get a black polish to use as a base or on its own, a couple of color changing polishes, a couple of cat eye polishes, and a sparkly red polish. They are all beautiful and the effects all work well. The cat eyes do require a few coats to get good coverage, and a bit of practice with the magnet to get a good design. The good thing about those are, you can always swipe through the design and start over till you get something you like, and then cure. I love the color changing ones the best, but they only show two toned on longer nails. Otherwise, they just change from one color to another, which is still pretty.<br />The huge thing about this company's sets that I don't like, is they are not labeled. Yes, you get stickers to swatch, but they don't stick! You end up having to glue them on or make other swatches. I really wish they would label or swatch the bottles. I'm starting to not get polish from brands that don't label. It's just such a hassle.<br />Overall, I love all the colors and effects. You can really come up with some unique nail designs with this set. I love the color change with one layer of the purple cat eye over top. This is a good mix and a lot of fun!

2.0,A Stylist's View: Has defects and is unusable. Bad customer service.,"The straight razor (shavette) I received is far from being professional quality nor could it be an heirloom that can be passed down in the family. It is made from cheap materials and has several defects.<br />The clasp is so thinly made, that it is easily bent just from disengaging it from the spine.  There is a gouge on one spine that goes in on one side and out on the other. And, the razor blade does not stay seated properly once clasped. The wooden scales are not neatly finished. The blades that come with it are not the snap kind. They are full double sided blades, making them more dangerous to have to cut them without getting cut. They are also very thin and cheap. There's no way I can shave a neck, sideburns, facial hair, etc., with this defective razor.<br />I could have overlooked cosmetic issues regarding a razor of this price point. It is the physical defects that hindered its use that are major problems for me.<br />I contacted the seller, but was told that I could keep the defective product, and ""we recommend another straight for you, better than that one in your hand"", and I was given the asin number, so I could purchase it.

5.0,A Nail Techs view: Perfect kit for the beginner! Great customer service. 5 stars⭐,"This Belle polygel kit is a great starter set from beginner to expert levels. It has some beautiful neutral colors, along with a white, and gorgeous glitters. They are all half ounce size tubes that will create a few sets of nails each, or you can mix and match the colors to make them go farther.<br />This kit includes; Six .5 oz. polygel colors, primer, gel base and top coats, a nail strengthener, cuticle oil, slip solution, dual forms, polygel brush with spatula, nail clips, and alcohol wipes. It comes nicely packaged in a lovely black box with cutouts to hold everything in place.<br />At minimum, you will need to supply your nail prep and finishing tools and liquids, such as: cuticle pusher and possibly nippers, a buffer, and nail dehydrator/alcohol, but these are things you will want to keep in good supply, anyways.<br />This polygel is so easy to work with. It is not too hard nor too soft. It's very easily workable with the provided slip solution. Even a beginner will have no trouble using it. Just remember, that if your surrounding temperature gets too cold or too hot, it affects the viscosity of the polygel, so work in a room that feels nice.<br />I did two nail swatches; one solid glitter and the other a French manicure with a shimmery twist. As I said, the polygel applied so easily, it also cured as expected without any problems, and the end results turned out beautiful.<br />I have to say that when I received my Belle polygel kit, there was a small issue with my order. I contacted their customer service and was met with such kindness and prompt service. They answered all my questions very quickly and respectfully. They're promptness in solving my problem, and their patience in dealing with my questions, shows me that they really care about their customers. Knowing that they were not privy to my customer status lets me know that they will treat all customers the same.<br />The colors are all so beautiful, and the glitters really make a statement. This set would make a great addition to anyone's collection and would also make a wonderful gift.

I'm just learning about a lot of the ingredients that are in most Korean beauty products, and I'm also Learning that some of them do not do well with my skin. This one works wonderfully for me. I use Retin-A, so anything really harsh or very exfoliating is too much. The first one made my skin very red, swollen, and angry looking.

I can't say which one it is for sure, but I suspect it's the snail mucin that made a noticeable and immediate difference in my skin.<br />My forehead skin has a few dimples and I have some fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes. I am 50 years old, but I've been using Retin-A for several years now. I've had a mostly natural skin care routine, other than the Retin-A, but recently decided to try a few of the K-beauty products out. This one was the first I used, and with the first use I can see my forehead and wrinkles were much smoother, along with the rest of my skin, as well. It also gave my skin a brighter look. With each use, it just gets better and better.<br />A little definitely goes a long way. Its texture is slimy, but I've found that I only need a very small amount to cover my face, and it massages in so easily. I also apply it to my neck & decollete.<br />I'm so glad that I tried this, and now I will just keep adding to it until I get the full K-beauty routine down.

5.0,Much more than just hyaluronic acid! Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars⭐,"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list.

3.0,Base coat brush dried up before finishing 2 nail swatches. 3 stars⭐,"I've used this brand's dip powders and thought they were great, so I wanted to give their liquids a try, as the powders did not come with them. I did two nail swatches, and before I was finished with the second one the base coat brush had dried almost completely out. It's unusable until cleaned. The top coat brush was also drying out.<br />Luckily a different brand sends several brushes along with their sets, and they actually fit these bottles. It would have been nice if this company had sent along extra brushes. A brush cleaner would have been nice, also. If I didn't have extra brushes, I would just be out of luck.<br />I've used so many dip liquids and have done so many dip nail sets, and this is the first time I've ever had a brush dry out.

Though this #8 brush is smaller than all of my other #8 brushes, it works very well when applying acrylics. Whenever I get a new brush, I always do a burn test on a few of the bristle strands. The bristles in this brush are some kind of natural fiber or fur, but I can't say that it's a Kolinsky Sable, as true Kolinsky Sable is usually much more expensive. The bristles are rather short, leaving me to wonder how well the brush will hold up in the long run, but it should last a while..<br />Overall this is a nice acrylic nail brush, that has a very pretty pattern on its handle. It works well when applying acrylics, and I've had no problems with bristle loss.

2.0,Formaldehyde?! Not safe. 2 Stars ⭐,"After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I ""might"" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tsaFpVMpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tsaFpVMpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tsaFpVMpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07SLFWZKN,B07SLFWZKN,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1616470171498,2,False
4.0,"Very moisturizing, but leaves too much oil behind. 3.5 stars ✨","The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.",[],B083B67373,B083B67373,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1614679036865,0,False
4.0,"Very hydrating, but left my face sticky. 4 stars ✨","This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.",[],B083BLZJ9M,B083BLZJ9M,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1613726358633,0,False
3.0,"Somewhat good in theory, not so great in reality. 2.5 Stars ✨","This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",[],B08N6CLJ6P,B08N6CLJ6P,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1613555086658,2,False

They work great for making my witch hazel facial toner spray and colloidal silver spray. The sprayers work pretty well, although the sprayer part spins around freely.

2.0,These are not USDA certified oils. 2 stars ✨,"First, I will say these oils seem fine. They work well together or apart, mixed into other skincare products or alone. I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.",[],B08LYT4Q2X,B08LYT4Q2X,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1609415095648,9,False

They are easy to fill from my large pump containers, which is a plus. My only issue is that mine are missing the clips that go on them.

4.0,"Not very , but very loud. 3.75 Stars ✨","I already had a large water flosser but was looking for something smaller and liked the idea of a rechargeable one. Upon first opening this flosser, it's very unique and different and would be great for traveling. The way the pieces of it fit together so compactly into each other, and then into a very nice fabric zip case with a handle, definitely sets this flosser apart.<br />When I used it, I found that it did not have near the amount of pressure that I'm used to from my other flosser. As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br />The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br />For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking.

4.0,"Not my favorite. A little tacky, hard to cure, and doesn't last long. 3.5 Stars ✨","In this kit, you get a nice set to complete a French tip design. You get 30 ml of each color, which is a wonderful size. You also get a base and topcoat, an application tool, and a couple of glitters. This would make the perfect kit if it didn't have a few issues.<br />So far, I've only used the clear and white poly gels to create a French tip design. They are a bit tackier than I would like them to be, which makes them harder to work with. They also take quite a bit longer to fully cure under an LED UV light than most other poly gels. I did use tips and dual forms. When I remove the dual forms after curing them for 60 seconds on top and bottom, they were still tacky on top. I had to cure them for another 30 seconds. My nails only lasted a little over a week before starting to lift around the edges. This is hardly a long-lasting poly gel, in my opinion.<br />I'm a still licensed but retired nail technician, so I am very well aware and knowledgeable on how to prep nails properly. User error was not the problem. These gels would be good for practice, but if you are looking for a poly gel that will last for more than a week, you may want to look at another brand. 3.5 Stars ✨",[],B087V12H74,B087V12H74,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1605141830168,2,False

It's slippery, hot, and doesn't' feel nice at all. The design seems like an afterthought, as it will not stay in place.<br /><br />So, I've had a big change of plans! I will be using these during my skincare routine and putting on my makeup. At least these headbands will get some use. I'm constantly losing the ones I have, so now I have plenty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3.5 stars for effort and couldn't bear to recommend them.

4.0,Acrylic girl tries Polygel for the first time...crazy different!,"This was my first experience with poly gel, and I can't say that it was an easy and straightforward one. I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro ""lift proof"" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.",[],B087G54FLM,B087G54FLM,AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,1598739212520,0,False
3.0,"Why didn't they add another magnet, so you can trim them?","This was my first magnetic eyeliner and eyelash kit. The eyeliner works great and the lashes adhere very well. The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths. The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara.

It only takes one for each task. I haven't had any problems with them falling apart or being too thin for my needs. Using them for my purposes, the three pack has & will last me for a pretty long time.<br />It's nice to find the right size product for the right size need that I have. I highly recommend these to anyone who has light duty needs for cotton rounds, and doesn't want to feel like they're wasting money, and throwing away the majority of a product, because it was just too large for what they needed it for.

I do wait about 10-15 minuites between each. But, I use the eye gel every night. They all work so well together and my skin is looking and feeling so much better. My biggest problems are large pores and uneven texture. My texture has evened out so much and my pores are surprising me more each day. I'd say these serums really have made the biggest difference in my pores. I kept seeing my grandmother's nose in the mirror, and I'm only 46--I was really self conscious.

4.0,Best Mascara but not flawless,"It's an excellent long-lash mascara and it can be easily paired with other mascara fixers from Korean brands.

5.0,Five star worthy,"If I could give these six stars I would. I was in the middle of purchasing a man scape replacement blade and saw that the Amazon vine program had one as a sample. This is not a paid review and not forced to give 5 stars.<br /><br />They are identical as the official manscaped blade which is the reason I test tried them. It cuts the exact same way and pretty much identical to the original. Best part is that you get two of them.<br /><br />Generally, they recommend replacing the blades every three months, but I've used my original 1 for over six months and as long as you clean the blade, wash it, as well as removing any hairs the buildup inside the original machine or on the blade itself one should last you about the same. Considering you get two of them for $20 (at the time of writing this review 4/20/2022)  its a great deal.<br /><br />I was getting ready to shave my chest and armpits and waited for the blades to get delivered. They cut identical as the original.

I've pretty much been living with my hair in a braid for the last year because it is the only thing I can do that doesn't end up in a huge mess but also mostly stays-well, except for all the frizzies and flyaways that sneak out.  So I was looking for another fast alternative to get my hair back and out of my face that also wouldn't require an hour of brushing to undo.<br />These were cheap, and Amazon is always so great about returns, that I decided to give it ago.  I figured, at worse, at least it would be a simple-ish way to pull my hair back when I am working at the computer.  And they are.  20 seconds and my hair is back in a bun without the discomfort of lots of other hair styles.  I mean, they are actually surprisingly comfortable.<br />But what I did not expect is for them to hold so well!  I put my hair in a high bun yesterday then went for a run.  I had fully intended to take the bun out and put my hair in a braid, because there was no way this thing would hold through a run, but IT DID!  7 miles later, my bun was still secure and tight, but comfortable and looked as good (which honestly wasn't that good to begin with) as it did when I first put it up.  I could not believe it held through the entire run.<br />In all honesty, they are a bit fussy to use, and I have not perfected making it look like a perfect doughnut bun.

I’ve tried a couple different versions and found this one to be good, if it fits your dog’s paws.<br />I have a golden retriever. The box I received said “medium” and it works for her, though it’s a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that’s good for cleaning, if you’re on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog’s paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean.

4.0,Patience required,"I’ve been trying out a couple of different lash serums over the past month. With my husband also using it (on his brows), while I use it on my lashes, we’ve been able to try different brands to see if there are any differences in results. This serum, by Kimuse, is very similar to the others in consistency (a thin liquid) and in how it’s applied (with a very thin brush). I have had no negative reactions to the serum, and no irritation to my eyes even when I’ve slipped and gotten some in my eye. This serum boasts results in as little as 3-4 weeks, while most others are more conservative at 6 weeks. In the few weeks we’ve been using the serums, neither of us have noticed any dramatic changes as far as lash or brow growth, but I do think I’m losing fewer lashes which is a definite plus. Honestly, I’m not sure if any serum is going to provide dramatic results, but we’ll continue for at least a few more weeks and see what happens while hoping for the best.Hopefully, I’ll be back with exciting news!<br /><br />Update: After using this, as well as other, lash growth serums for several months, I have noticed a definite improvement in the length of my lashes. I have not noticed as significant an improvement in the thickness, or volume, of my lashes, however. I believe that these types of serums do help promote growth, and I haven't been able to detect much difference between brands except that a couple of them irritated my eyes. Therefore, my conclusion is that this is helpful and the real determination of what works best will be what's most comfortable for you to use, so read the ingredients and watch for any possible allergy triggers or irritants.",[],B09BB89YJK,B09BB89YJK,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,1635211232811,4,False
4.0,"Nice cream, gimmicky packaging","When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",[],B08Y7HV8CQ,B08Y7HV8CQ,AGQFUBXP54N5SB54U5LRPL62B2NQ,1635091963994,1,False

5.0,WHY DIDN'T I GET THIS SOONER?!,"Oh my GAWWWD! This thing is amazing! This will be a lengthy review, but if you are like me, I hope you'll enjoy the very detailed essay I am about to write for the 2nd time because my original review closed out of the page :(<br /><br />I will preface this by letting you know I have coarse, curly hair. ""bUt hEaThEr, wHat nUmBer aNd pOroSitY aRe YoU?"".<br />I am 3a-c and high porosity. Now, it is storytime LOL, so grab a snack or an adult bev.<br /><br />Let me tell you about the root, no pun intended, of a good portion of my self esteem issues LOL. When I was a kid, I was teased relentlessly about my hair. Ah yes, even Rave/LA Looks gel, with a spritz of White Rain hairspray couldn't tame this! Kids are mean. I ran cross country all through high school, and with many mornings having only an hour to get ready after running until my bunions ached (what the heck heather, TMI!), I eventually learned the only way to keep these people from throwing tiny paper balls in my hair or touching it, was to throw it in a bun. Containment, if you will. That thing was so tight I could hardly think straight. Does that explain my grades lol? So, my hair means a lot to me, y'all!<br /><br />Moving onto the stuff you really want to know, the magical brush I'm in love with💖<br /><br />This brush has what I assume are nylon bristles. The only suggestion I have is to replace them with boar bristles, but it isn't a deal breaker. A few, and I mean 2 or 3, of those bristles came out when I was examining this baby before using it. It has pins and bristles all the way around and up and down. They don't tug at the hair or stretch it to damage or snap damp hair. I did brush my hair out with a wet brush before using, though.<br /><br />The brush is so lightweight, I didn't think it was going to do much lol. Thank you to the manufacturer for making it so lightweight! It was such a breeze to brush the sections of hair. My wrists were happy :)<br /><br />The brush does get hot, but not too hot! I accidentally touched the metal part a few times and I still have all my fingers! Yeehaw! There is a little knob that sticks out, to grasp onto as you roll the brush through your hair. You could probably use a straightening glove too! I have never used a Revlon brush, nor touched one irl. So, take that for what it is, but I've watched A LOT of videos on YouTube with that specific brush. I believe the Revlon is heavier and hotter than this brush. I have heard of some gals smelling burning. I did not experience that. I did use a heat protectant (up to 450°) along with a leave in cream. By the way, there is an air (I assume cool) setting, which is amazing as it is actually regar air! Not semi warm air like some dryers I've used in the past. The low setting is low and the high is faster and hotter. They light up so you know what is what! Love it.<br /><br />Please don't expect this to smooth it out like a flat iron would. This provides the perfect base though, to smooth with a flat iron quickly. It took me from start to finish about 50 mins. Some of that time was spent sectioning and spraying the hair with protectant, as well as doing some house stuff. Realistically it maybe took 40 mins. I did wait after my wash and condition, to let the hair dry a little bit. To about 85%. I even spritzed dry sections with water as needed, so my brush could glide through. I've only used this 2x. Once on wet hair and once for a touch up. I'm hoping to be as good as Julissa Guillen on YouTube, as I use this more :) maybe I'll be faster and it'll be smoother too!<br /><br />I used this before bedtime, so I don't have a day of wear pics available for you.<br /><br />But, the second pic shows my hair wet, unbrushed.<br /><br />The third pic is right after finishing! AMAZING! I was literally in awe! Couldn't believe it. Even after cosmetology school, I couldn't master a blowout on myself *cries*<br /><br />The fourth pic is the next morning. Slept on a regular cotton pillowcase (I should get a satin one from Amazon lol). I left it down while I slept btw.<br /><br />The last pic is after a go through with the flat iron. I didn't have to section my hair for once to flat iron my hair! I just ran it through with some more heat protectant as well, a must have :D<br /><br />Besides the boar bristle suggestion, I did notice the words on the dryer are already faded. It doesn't affect the dryer, so I really don't care lol. The other thing was the twisty thing to turn the dryer on, doesn't line up directly with the lights and words (OFF, AIR, LOW, HIGH). Again, I don't care but everyone different, so I wanted to let you beautiful awesome people know!<br /><br />Overall, I am so impressed and so upset at myself for not getting one of these sooner. Can't beat the value and it comes with a warranty. Thank you HAUSBELL, I LOVE YOU!❣💞🥰💇‍♀️","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B17P6N4R-jS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B17P6N4R-jS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B17P6N4R-jS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1TvF70+NiS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1TvF70+NiS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1TvF70+NiS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1UgYwuXqkS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1UgYwuXqkS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1UgYwuXqkS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1X1UODU3yS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1X1UODU3yS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1X1UODU3yS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1jpqLHHPtS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1jpqLHHPtS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1jpqLHHPtS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08BXPZRQG,B08BXPZRQG,AEFLI4UZYPFDCZ33XHMTWXAQDDWQ,1630822218848,0,False

4.0,Doesn’t work on coarse facial hair,"I got this product hoping it would help with my super coarse facial hair (I’m a woman). It doesn’t, but that isn’t the product’s fault. I read online that really coarse hair has to be pretty long (like half an inch long!) for waxing to be effective, and who would want to let their facial hair grow like that? Not me!<br /><br />It works for other types of hair, though. I was able to wax my legs. The temperature control is reassuring (no worries about burns), and the roll on applicator is way less messy than sticks in a pot. It comes with plenty of supplies, too.

3.0,As effective as other brands; bit harder to peel off the backing; wasteful packaging,"These patches work as well as other patches I've tried. They are not a miraculous cure-all, but they do help flatten out the acne and draw out the stuff that needs to be drawn out (don't want to get too gross and graphic here). They are small (1 cm diameter) so the coverage is limited, but they adhere well.<br /><br />There are a couple of cons with these that lower my score:<br /><br />> They are harder to peel off the backing than others, and it's easy to fold over the edge of the patch when removing it, making it less effective. Other brands I've used have slits in the backing material, making it much easier to dispense a patch without damaging it.<br /><br />> The packaging is very wasteful. Each sheet of 20 comes in its own box. You could easily fit several sheets into one box. Either the box should be made much smaller or each box should hold multiple sheets. There's no need for all this packaging waste.<br /><br />Three stars (average).

4.0,Good performance; no scent; slow to absorb,"This is a pretty good cream for dealing with ultra dry, cracked skin. I've used it with good results on my elbows -- it softens, soothes and helps with healing. There's only a small hint of a scent to it that is only noticeable if you smell the cream in the jar. Once it's applied there's no scent that I can detect, which is a major plus.<br /><br />It's a soft cream that's easy to dispense and spread. That's also a plus since other intensive moisturizing creams I've tried tend to be more solid and harder to use. This has more of a whipped cream type of consistency that's easy to work with.<br /><br />It does take time to soak in, and my skin remains greasy feeling for a while after using it. It's not a significant problem for elbows, knees, feet, etc., but is a issue when using it on my hands. The greasy feeling makes it not a great hand cream other than at night.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a better than average intensive moisturizing cream.

3.0,"Nice compact size, but too little witch hazel to be of significant benefit","This are mini wipes, with each measuring about 5.25 by 4.25 inches. They are packaged very compactly, making them easy to take along in a gym bag, backpack or even in your pocket. The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a ""prep"" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best.

It's a woodsy type of scent that is different and very enjoyable. The scent does not linger after use (which is a shame since it is such a nice smell).<br /><br />It's pricey per ounce, but considering how little is needed for good results, the cost per use is not bad at all.

It also has a screw top cover, which is a nice touch for keeping the lid affixed if you take this while traveling or use it in a gym bag.<br /><br />It's an unusual but enjoyable twist on face soap.

2.0,"Some nice items, but disappointing quality for toenail clippers","This is a comprehensive set of nail cutting/trimming/maintaining tools. The standard clipper is very nice -- solid, sharp, and well up to the task of handling fingernails and lighter toenails. The various tools are also of decent quality.<br /><br />What's not so good is the toenail clippers. It has a rather lightweight feel to it compared with other clippers I've used. The short handles make it less comfortable to use than other clippers. More importantly, the spring mechanism failed within the first couple of minutes of use. It uses two leaf style springs that push the jaws apart. The problem is with how they attach to the handle. There are two little prongs for each spring that fit into two little holes in the handle. For mine, the pins are too short to make a solid connection, so one falls (or rather, jumps) out no matter how many times I've tried to seat it properly into the handle (see photo).  It can be used without the spring, but it's quite cumbersome to do so. Given the importance of the toenail clipper to the overall usefulness of the kit, I see this as a 2 star product.<br /><br />If the springs were better it would be 4 stars since, even when properly functioning, the clippers are not as easy to use as others, but warrant 4 stars given the low cost compared with better quality clippers.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81a7frRBN9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81a7frRBN9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81a7frRBN9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B091CYYXLL,B091CYYXLL,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,1620849117861,0,False
2.0,"Proven ingredients, but a poor value","I’m not all that impressed with these products. Neither container lists the ingredients on the label, instead providing the ingredient list on a card that’s in the box. It shows that the cleaner is a 2% salicylic acid wash, which is a pretty tried and true formulation for treating acne. It is a low-lather, but still effective cleaner, but I didn’t experience any difference with this compared with other 2% salicylic cleaners that cost far less. It’s a fine cleaner, but way overpriced for such a tiny (0.51 oz) container.<br /><br />The repairing night cream is a combination of retinol (0.05%), niacinamide (3%), and hyaluronic acid (2%). All are proven performers, but again, it’s quite overpriced considering how low of a percentage of retinol is in the formulation. It does a decent job of moisturizing and did not cause any skin irritation. I am a fan of retinol, but the concentration in this cream (0.05%) is well below what I usually use (either 0.1% or 0.5%).<br /><br />While this product combo is on the right track, the value is just not there considering the amount in the container (one-half an ounce for each). While I would certainly recommend a salicylic acid wash and a retinol-based cream, there are many other options that provide these options at a far lower cost.

The bottle itself is well-made and sturdy. The included caps (2 were provided) are of excellent quality, with polycone inserts to maintain an air-tight, leak proof seal. The included sprayers (2 were provided) are functional, but rather cheap in terms of build quality, especially the trigger. It also comes with a tiny little funnel that is way undersized and pretty useless given the bottle volume, and a few black labels (which require a white pen, which is NOT included).<br /><br />Each bottle comes in a bubble pack sleeve, but the box itself is rather thin with limited protection. These are a notch below other bottles I've received when it comes to manufacturer-provided protective packing. Still, the bottles did not break or chip in transit.<br /><br />The bottles needed a good wash before use since the outside had some type of greasy-feeling film. I would have washed them regardless of their condition, but these definitely needed a good washing before use.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration I'll rate these as 4 stars.

I love the scent -- it's a light, ""fresh"" scent that is sort of floral and sort of botanical. Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smell great and it is very gentle, but it's not a face soap I'd get again.

5.0,Very good quality; useful extras,"I'm very pleased with these glass bottles. The glass is thick and, while it's certainly not immune to breaking, it can deal with the occasional bump without a problem. Having it be tinted brown is great for limiting the amount of UV that can enter, plus gives it a nice look.  The caps are excellent and provide a good seal. The sprayers are just OK. They work, but are not all that heavy-duty. I'm using these more for storage than application, so I'm more interested in the cap seal than the sprayer.<br /><br />It also comes with a very useful funnel, a dropper and a white marker. The funnel is something that I'll use often; I won't use the others. But, it's a nice complement of accessories.<br /><br />The bottles come very well packaged with two layers of bubble pack, and are in a box that's the right size to prevent things from moving around.

4.0,"Excellent lather, performance and scent; fussy bottle","I'm impressed with this face soap. It's very thick and silky, and only a very small amount is needed to get good results. That's especially welcome to find out given the price for a pretty small bottle.  It lathers up well and does a good job of cleaning without leaving my skin overly dry. It is a bit more intensive than other face soaps, so my face does feel a little 'tight' after using it. However, it's not excessive, and well worth it given how well this soap cleans if you have an oily complexation. The charcoal makes the soap dark, but it's not as jet-black as other charcoal soaps I've used. It's more of a deep gray.<br /><br />The scent is also quite nice. It's a medium/light intensity and has sort of an after-shave smell to it. The scent does not linger much at all after rinsing. While I tend to prefer unscented soaps, this scent is pleasant and enjoyable.<br /><br />The only con is the bottle. Getting the pump nozzle to pop up was a chore since the retaining ring the pump head screws into also rotates, making it a struggle to get the nozzle to pop up. I eventually got it working, but have noticed that the pump leaks at the stem. It's a small leak, but it adds up over a few days to make a mess on the bottle and waste soap.  Given the price, the pump mechanism should have been of better quality.<br /><br />One star down for the bottle issues, but otherwise, it's a very enjoyable soap to use.",[],B08F3GBQMB,B08F3GBQMB,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,1601492920270,0,False

It's softer than the standard but firmer than the Ultra Soft.<br /><br />On the downside, it does not fit as well as the authentic Oral-B brushes. It's a little bit loose, which causes it to be noisier in operation than an authentic brush. It still works fine and stays on firm enough so there's no danger of it coming off in use, but there's enough play in the fit that it's more buzzy than an authentic.<br /><br />Even with the fit issue, this is a decent alternative to the Oral-B brand brushes and a solid 4-star brush.",[],B07DY1RDQR,B07DY1RDQR,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,1560867463741,0,False
3.0,Nice look; feels pretty solid; but average in performance & value,"This is a “dressed up” version of the Wahl “LifeProof” shaver (which I also reviewed). It has a more upscale look and feel to it, plus adds a battery gauge to show the charge level. However, the shave quality is the same – OK, but not a standout.<br /><br />The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it’s more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and ‘shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars).

5.0,"Truly some wonderful stuff to fight ""winter hands""","I hate winter for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that my hands get so dry that I get cracks at my fingertips. It’s annoying and painful, especially at night. I’ve tried all sorts of moisturizers without much success. The best results (if you can call it that) have been from using petroleum jelly, but that’s messy and it still doesn’t work well.<br /><br />This argan oil, however, has been hugely effective. It gave me results right from the first day, and over the course of just a few days I can see noticeable healing of the skin cracks. No more pain and my hands feel far better than any other treatment I’ve tried.<br /><br />The product comes very nicely packaged, with a nice box filled with shredded packing material to keep the glass bottle safe in transit. It also makes for a very nice presentation should you want to give this as a gift. The bottle comes with a dropper and a “spritz” head. The latter is my only quibble – the spray head didn’t work well at all, and made sort of a mess when using it to dispense the oil. I replaced it with the dropper and had much better results.<br /><br />The oil itself has little or no scent. You need very, very little for results – I use about 1-2 small drops per hand, and that’s more than enough. It spreads easily (as expected given that it’s oil). It does take a few minutes to soak in – my hands are very greasy when I first apply it, but after a few minutes the greasiness goes away. The sheen from the oil stays around longer, but that too dissipates after 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />This can be used for a wide range of applications including face, body and even hair. It comes with a good amount of information to help explain how/where to use it, and how the oil was processed.<br /><br />I’m very impressed with this oil – it’s the only product I’ve ever tried that totally worked to solve my dry/cracked hands. It’s not cheap, but well worth the price if you need a highly effective moisturizer.

5.0,Nice improvement,"This is a nice improvement to the Sonicare line of brushes. It appears to be their response to the Oral-B Floss Action line of brushes that have a ""paddle"" to help get between teeth. This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.<br /><br />I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean's bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.<br /><br />But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I'm a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.<br /><br />These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.<br /><br />If you're a ProResults user these are well worth trying out. If you have tender gums you may want to alternate between the HydroClean and the ProResults (or, as I do, with the Oral-B. The Oral-B also makes a super soft brush if you have very sensitive gums. Hard to find, but works very well).<br /><br />Keep in mind that nothing takes the place of flossing.

I’m honestly not sure if I can say these get rid of the bags, but after wearing them for a little while, they definitely make my eyes feel better, which is still a win in my opinion.

Obviously, these kinds of masks tend to be a little messy because of the product that they are soaked in, but with these, they are just dripping. After removing the mask, the instructions say to rub in any excess product into your skin, but there's just way too much and it does not rub in. I have to blot my skin with a towel before rubbing in the excess. Other than that, the mask is nice. It feels soothing to the skin, I haven't had any reactions to it and my skin feels soft afterward.",[],B084MFRV6H,B084MFRV6H,AHT5CUJ2KRJ442O7HTMURJJRFK5Q,1598888831739,0,False

I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.

This is a huge bottle of shampoo and will last me a long time.  It makes very good lather - nice and light and it rinses out well.  My hair is very clean afterwards.

They are made out of breakable plastic so I have to be a little careful with them, but they are very pretty in their unusual colorful design.

This is the first gray color eye brow pencil I've used and I like it pretty well.  The gray color is medium - not dark or light, but right there in the middle.  I use a very light touch and short strokes to get the color where I want it.  I have scant eye brow hairs and have to fill in to make it look like I have full eyebrows.  I like how this did, it seems to be waterproof and I really need waterproof because I play a lot of tennis and sweat a lot on the court under the hot sun in the Deep South.

It won't stop sweating, but it will keep the smelly bacteria from breeding for a while so you don't stink.

3.0,Too Expensive for What You Get,"I've reviewed other lotions that were pricey like this one, as of this review this Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion costs $25.90.  I think that's kind of expensive because though it's a good moisturizer, it's not a great moisturizer.  I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used.  I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed.  But, I wouldn't be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an average level of moisturization.",[],B07SW7D6ZR,B07SW7D6ZR,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,1580763310383,0,False

Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.

4.0,Good Nail Polish Remover,I used this nail polish remover today to remove some nail polish that was 3 layers deep and hard dried.

That said, I only had my toes painted so it was not really possible for me to stick my toes in the jar and rotate them so I took the sponge out, gave it a squeeze to get to the excess nail polish remover off and went to work with on my toes.  It was very easy and very fast.  This nail polish remover is at least 3x better than what I have in bottles underneath my bathroom sink.  I think as the nail polish remover is used up and/or evaporates I will refill it with more nail polish remover.  The pink sponge was soft, yet still rough enough to get the old nail polish off.  At first I was thinking this thing was going to be a bust, but it has turned out to be extremely useful.",[],B07S6CYNBK,B07S6CYNBK,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,1569621892266,0,False

They are so close to being the same size to fit, but the post on this toothbrush is too big for my replacement Phillips heads to fit.  So, replacement heads will have to be ordered specially and sometimes finding non-brand sonic toothbrush heads can be hard.  I have another sonic toothbrush that I love, but can't find any replacement toothbrush heads for it.  Other than the toothbrush heads, I think this is an awesome sonic toothbrush, does a great job (has lots of different settings but I only use one), and will make a retro bathroom look even more retro.",[],B07N45YN6C,B07N45YN6C,AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,1562703345558,0,False

I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz.  I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one.

5.0,Great software suite for small business at excellent price!,"Ready to to get 2019 under swing with sure footing? This software suite is perfect for the small business with big goals and the features assure you can accurately assess where you are with your finances as you meet them. My brother is a real estate agent and while there are other industry-specific programs for that, he is really enjoying this QuickBooks so far because it allows him to track his expenses, listings aka inventory, commissions and taxes that must be precise with each transaction. Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having.

3.0,Works best on normal nails not thick ones,"This is a handy set of stainless podiatrist style nail trimmers and tools that come in a zippered storage case, making it convenient for travel or storage.<br /><br />The set includes one curved clipper, one angled one, a lifter for ingrown nails, a pusher for cuticle care, and two different files for smooth finishing.  The angled main clipper has a non-adjustable internal tension spring and a coated ergonomic shaped hand grip, while the other clipper has a coated non-ergonomic shaped grip.<br /><br />When trying to cut through tough thick nails you need a sure grip. Unfortunately, the grip coating material used on these clippers is hard and not padded, therefore failing to provide cushioning to users with arthritis or to provide a non-slip grip.<br /><br />I tried these clippers on my father's thick toenails, and they do cut, but not as sharply or precisely as the professional grade clippers I usually use on his nails.  Instead of one clean cut, it took several clips to get through his tough nails with these and because of that the finish was jagged and needed filing to smooth out.<br /><br />Though I wouldn't recommend this set for seniors, I do think the curved shape of the larger clipper is a nice touch though, so they're useful enough for regular nails and handy to pack if you're planning a trip.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XSpMXudYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XSpMXudYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XSpMXudYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e+cXde7yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e+cXde7yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71e+cXde7yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BJ1Q9MDG,B0BJ1Q9MDG,AECYM4TEVRJGZ43LFV7V2ORY5R4A,1669227741886,0,False

It also has plenty of serum and the mask lasted for over 20 minutes without drying.<br /><br />The Cucumber Essence is soothing and hydrating.

I found the face oil was not quickly absorbed into the skin.  I would prefer to use this at night because of the time it takes for the oil to be absorbed.  I did wake up with well hydrated skin.

Resveratrol comes from grapes and has strong antioxidants.  This Essential Lipid Power Infusion also contains argan oil, rose hip oil, and a mix of extracts.<br /><br />I found this Essential Lipid Power Infusion to stay on my skin for a relatively long time.

The sunblock is thicker than usual but effective. It has a great smell and not greasy.  One application lasts reasonably long even when I exercise.

5.0,Just got an amazing shave!,"I have about 10 razors. I have been in search of better and better shaves. My Feather AS-D2 is awesome and smooth but perhaps a bit too mild. I fine even the Merkur 34C a little too aggressive for my skin. The Merkur Futur is horrible for me and is a paperweight for anyone who prefers mild razors. The iKon B1 slant is a perfect balance. Not too aggressive, and with a light touch it gave me a very smooth shave. I normally do 3 passes and then touch up areas that need it. I had 5 days growth when I shaved with this razor head today. I was amazed when I finished my first pass. It looked like I had done two passes with my other razors. I normally do with the grain, cross-grain, and then lightly against the grain.<br />With the B1 I did a with-the-grain pass and one very light across-the-grain pass and it looked like I was done shaving. I did a touch-up in one or two spots and I called it good. An against the grain pass would have left me absolutely BBS but that usually gives me ingrown hairs. Oh, by the way, no nicks, weepers, or irritation at all. The head is shaped very weird with the slant design but I was able to shave under my nostrils with ease; much better than most, actually! I really am impressed with this head.<br />I can't wait to do another shave tomorrow.<br />My shave:<br />iKon B1 head<br />iKon OSS handle from my 101<br />Persona Lab Blue blade (2nd shave on the blade)<br />Stirling Soap Co.

They don't pull or catch my hair, they don't stretch out of shape, they don't break and bend.  I know this is a lot of $$ to spend on a barrette when you can get one for a fraction of this price at your corner drug store, but these France Luxe barrettes are worth it.  This coral colored scallop design is beautiful, and the barrette hold a lot of hair.  This is definitely for thick hair.  France Luxe also makes boule style barrettes for fine hair -- so if you don't have a thick mop, I would check out the other France Luxe designs.

5.0,Great,"After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn't last that long and I could seldom get an acceptable shave around the neck. The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel ""sarcophagus"" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.<br /><br />The only negatives are that it's quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it's pricey... I'm still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal...

4.0,So far so good,"Update 20/02/10<br /><br />After a year and a half of good service my HQ7140 would not start even with the cord plugged in, unless I left it connected for a couple of hours...Obviously not an option when you're trying to get to work. I was about to order another one, already cursing for having to go back to blades even if only temporarily; but before that I took it to a specialized shop; they opened it and showed me it was wet on the inside and told me the ""circuit"" was fried. I explained that I had followed the manual to the letter, cleaning the shaving heads and the hair chamber with hot running water. They suggested taking the shaving unit off when I rinse it, use only warm (not hot) water, and *not* cleaning the hair chamber with water... They essentially sold me a brand new Philips HQ7120 as a replacement to use with my existing shaving unit for a reasonable price; it looks exactly the same except it has a ""Low"" red light.<br /><br />The interesting bit is that I had gone to them about a month ago to buy a new shaving unit and they told me the HQ9 heads would work fine with these models, not just the HQ8; the HQ9 feel even better, so much so that I would definitely buy the 8xxx series which use the HQ9... It was only when the 7140 failed that I realized just how much I depend on it and how well it has worked out - my technique still needs to improve and shaving still seems to take too long but no going back to blades for me!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />As a wet shaving refugee I didn't know what to expect; I was just tired of getting cuts everyday, and paying an exhuberant tax to the wet shaver companies; I didn't want to buy a top of the line model in case things didn't work out.<br /><br />This has been a very pleasant surprise, as I'm getting close shaves with less fuss and no irritation; I beginning to get the hang of this and even the neck area is doing well.<br /><br />The battery's first run lasted for 4 days, but I may be taking a lot longer than normal while I learn.

I guess TOBS discontinued the scent, so the supplier was clearing out inventory.<br /><br />It's a cologne-type scent with a modern vibe.

The cream is harder than other TOBS creams I've used, but that doesn't affect performance in the least.<br /><br />The kit also comes with a badger brush and a cologne. The brush is actually pretty good! It's black badger hair, so the bristles are relatively stiff/scritchy, but I prefer that. Had the typical badger funk for the first few shaves, but now it's neutral. No lost bristles yet, so it seems like a quality brush/knot.<br /><br />The cologne is also nice, a matching scent to the shave cream. I find that it lasts 2-3 hours on my skin.

5.0,Tasty Coffee Drops in a Tin,"We love coffee in our house so when I was presented with the opportunity to try these coffee drop candies in a tin I couldn’t pass them up. You get 3 cute little tins full of the candies and each had a freshness seal around them. The tin was easy to open, there were no sugar pieces from the coating that fell out, and each tin had 21 pieces in them. I found the size of the coffee drops to be quite adequate, not too small and not too big. I saw where a couple people thought they were huge but they’re about the size of a jelly bean but not as fat. They have a smooth coffee flavor with some sugar added in to make them the perfect little sweet. I found them to be very tasty and enjoyable. One candy at a time is plenty for a treat. They arrived in a cute black box that makes them perfect for gift giving and the tins are the perfect size to put in your purse, pocket, desk drawer, end table or pretty much anywhere else that you want to tuck away some coffee sweetness. We thought these were so good that we’re going to try one of Cavendish & Harvey’s variety packs next.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

I have to agree with other reviewers in that the instructions and English was an atrocious and I assumed the product would be as well. After all, a person would think that with such carelessness in the description of the product, that the product itself would be inferior. Oh, how wrong I was! I have highlighted hair that has also been damaged by a flat iron. I have been wanting to grow my hair out some but with the damage I was doing to my hair, each time I went for a “trim”, my hair dresser would have to cut off too much damaged ends. So, I quit using a flat iron and started using better products on my hair. When I got the opportunity to review this item, I was excited to give it a try and see if it would help. What I found was simply amazing. My hair now feels thick and bouncy and I can’t believe how much easier it is to style. My hair is very fine so the additions of hair products usually just weighs my hair down, but this product does not. I can’t wait until my next trim with my hair dresser and see if she notices a difference…I certainly did. I did receive this item at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and I am grateful for that opportunity.",[],B013F9YX2I,B013F9YX2I,AE4XZPWBPOG5RREOBXH7HHTWAWGQ,1470248680000,0,False
5.0,What I have always wanted!!,"I have been wanting a case like this for a very long time and when I got the opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, I jumped at the chance and I am so glad that I did. This pink train case is all and more than I expected and I am beyond thrilled to own this now. In the past I have thrown all my makeup in a zippered travel case and then had to try and sift through the items inside to locate what I was looking for. Sometimes I would just dump the contents out because it was such a struggle. With this pink beauty, all my items can be nicely organized and will stay right when I put them. When closed up, nothing is going to move around and when opened up, everything is right within easy reach and easy to find. This has a large mirror which was a great surprise to me that sits at a perfect height and angle when putting on my makeup. I have struggled for some time to find a way to use a hand held make up mirror while trying to put on my makeup while traveling.  I also really appreciated that the top two sections have plastic on the bottom of the tray. We all know that makeup can get messy if spilled and this will allow for easy clean-up if such a thing should ever happen. The case itself is a nice shade of pink and the quality of workmanship is awesome. I could tell by just picking the case up how strong and sturdy that it was. I am so excited to have this case and I am extremely grateful that I was given the opportunity to purchase this at a discount for an honest, unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RlFlvNzNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RlFlvNzNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RlFlvNzNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eL4Q2i0WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eL4Q2i0WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eL4Q2i0WL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vCzDeqM9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vCzDeqM9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vCzDeqM9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AJUWNMI,B01AJUWNMI,AE4XZPWBPOG5RREOBXH7HHTWAWGQ,1467832287000,5,False

It took me less than 5 minutes to completely apply these. Make sure you apply the liner, let it set 15 to 20 seconds and then reapply.

The tan looks like I spent the day in the sun, rather than dark brown or orange.<br /><br />The problem with a product like this is the color contrast with the places you do not apply this to, or if you miss a spot, or if you have thinning hair. It can go on blotchy if it is not applied evenly. Some parts of the body might become darker or not absorb this as well. Making it appear smooth is a challenge. Also, where do you stop applying this to your body? Wherever you stop there will be a contrast with the untanned skin. One particular problem is your hairline and scalp. I have thinning hair, so the contrast between a pale scalp and a tanned face looks odd. This is a challenging product to use and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are already used to using sunless tanners.<br /><br />It is not greasy, it did not stain, and it dried quickly.

5.0,"So far I am pleased with this set, having sensitive skin, it works for me","First, this Beard Growth Kit, 10 In 1 Beard Kit For Men with Beard Oil, Beard Balm, Beard Conditioner set offers a nice number of items if you are considering a gift this holiday season (or any time). It’s a nice box, again, offers a good number of items for a gift, and is done nicely enough in box set up and presentation it would be well received. Second, the items in it are a good range of “quality” so I think it’ll be appreciated. What I am saying: the brush, comb, bag, scissors, and guard are decent, but not great quality. You can get better quality, but for working needs and for a gift, this is pretty good. But, for example the scissors feel a bit cheaper. But they will get use as long as they cut well enough. I’m not big into using a guard, but this one is like others I’ve had. The included bag is decent, but I’d never use it; if traveling or moving my stuff I’d use a toiletry bag. The brush is not as nice as others I have, but it’s useable and gets the job done. Same with the comb. That brings us to the shampoo, Conditioner, and oil. NOTE: I have extremely sensitive skin, so this review is based on my experience from that standpoint. I like a range of scents or items to keep my beard in good shape, but I have a far more difficult time finding things that work and are okay on my skin. I have only used these items once, but that’s all it takes to know. I come away happy - they all worked and NO reaction. I used the shampoo and conditioner in the shower today and they not only had a nice, light scent, but I was bale to let it sit on the beard for a few minutes each, having no issues with skin and liking the smell. The beard felt soft following and I liked how they worked overall. Next, the oil. I believe it is claimed to be used for “beard growth,” and maybe it’ll help with that. My beard is decent, but I do have spots that could use thickening, so again, I keep an eye open for options. However, there is no way to know if it’ll work for that for a few weeks if not months. So until then, it again did fine on my skin - not a single ounce of negative reaction. The sect is light, so it’s nice to smell, but one (my wife) has to get up close to smell it. I do like it that way, so it doesn’t bug my sinuses or overwhelm. In the end I’m very happy so far with this Beard Growth Kit, 10 In 1 Beard Kit For Men with Beard Oil, Beard Balm, Beard Conditioner set and happy I grabbed it. I’ll use it and if all stays well, would consider getting it again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615hhHI-nzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615hhHI-nzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615hhHI-nzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H5lUu7hYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H5lUu7hYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61H5lUu7hYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HQ6-ilhsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HQ6-ilhsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HQ6-ilhsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JoPHw2c6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JoPHw2c6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JoPHw2c6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N+JdimJLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N+JdimJLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61N+JdimJLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fV55RrViL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fV55RrViL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fV55RrViL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vqC7EDt+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vqC7EDt+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vqC7EDt+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09DCT687H,B09DCT687H,AHSL6SPJ3F6JQU4TG2UFMHVVQCKA,1636502281702,1,False
5.0,So far this is working well for my sensitive skin; will see how it goes in the long run,"First off, I have extremely sensitive skin overall, but especially on my face. To that end, I must be very carefully about what I put on. I do tend towards lighter or no scents, but have found some that work alright for me. But with or without scent, I can still have issues. In the end, it’s how my skin handles anything that is the bottom line for me. In this case, this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils works well for me and so far, I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I use a derma roller a couple times a week to help with hair in my beard and front of my head. At this point I then add a beard oil to these locations to help stimulate growth. Without doing major testing with all the elements, like a control group (area) of my head, it’s hard to say what works and what doesn’t. I feel like the derma roller has a large part in how well growth or at least slowing of loss goes. But, I have also come to believe some of these oils available do play a supportive role. To that point, I won’t be able to speak about this Provence Beauty Beard Oil - All Natural Fragrance Free Olive, Sunflower & Jojoba Oils  for awhile. I have only just begun to use it - as a replacement for another oil.<br /><br />But I do like that 1. it’s not too oily on my hair or skin, 2. has little to no real scent, 3. feels fine and is not a problem on my skin, and 4. that it washes off my hands easily post application. Right now I like it as an oil providing at least some softening to my beard. Will it aide growth?

4.0,"I really wanted to like this and I do, except, my sensitivities can’t take it","I will fully admit up front, I have a very bad sensitivity to scents. In my years of life I’ve only found maybe half a dozen I can put up with. I usually avoid them - but because I enjoy them - I do try to find ways to use it. Because of these sensitivities I try not to “blame” the product, unless it burns - then I have to question what all is in there. In this case, I decided to try Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine because of other reviews - I was hoping... but sadly, nope, I can’t do it. So I’m giving it 4 stars 1. because I do like the smell, but 2. it lasts far too long, smelled like it got stronger than lighter, and in the end, was too much for me. I got the Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine and both my wife and I liked the smell, but immediately worried it would be too much based on first sniffs. I put it on, and it worked great. It’s easy to put on - only a small amount covered my hair easily - and smelled nice. It was easy to work with my hair and it looked great. But as time went on, this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty started to smell more and more and more. The smell did not dissipate, but grew. And my head started to really hurt.<br />In the end, I do like this Atlas Semi Matte Texture Putty 2.4 Ounce is a Medium Shine for how it works and how it looks. But for sensitive guys, you need to be aware, this putty has a strong scent - in my case at least, too strong.

4.0,"It’s a decent idea, it worked, but not with the included suction cups","I drive my wife nuts when I trim my beard in the bathroom - I try to catch all the clippings, but without something like this, it does not work well. I thought I”d give this a try - it seems like a great idea, but...<br /><br />1. It arrived with 1 plastic bib, 2 suction cups with hooks, and 1 shaving cream brush.<br />2. The plastic bib feels okay - it’s a thin plastic, but it should last for a decent amount of time. It is not as nice as most of the kinds I’ve experienced or we own for haircutting<br />3. Its stitching is okay - I think it’ll last decently<br />4. There are two loops on the ends you will attach to the suction cups.<br />5. The suction cups - are worthless. This is why it gets the 4 stars - I would have given it 3 stars if we didn’t have our own suction cups to use instead of theirs. One of the two that came with it stuck for 5 - 10 seconds before it stopped working altogether. The other suction cup doesn’t even look right - it looks like it never worked and was not made properly.<br />6. We have suction cups (bought on Amazon) we were able to use - I looped that part of the bib onto them, which worked, but not designed for this, they would fall off. I’ll end up taping them to it - at least that way I’ll be able to use it.<br />7. It fit me fine. It felt fine - just like a haircut cape. The white looks weird - I’m used to the far more common black - but at the same time I think it’ll show the beard hair really well.<br />8. I did notice that as I go in closer to the mirror to see what I’m doing it folds over in front of me and isn’t as trapped out - be aware of this because it’s easy to start missing the catch in the bib.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent thing to have and it’ll make my wife happy not getting the beard clippings all over the place. This could be a little nicer -  a little thicker plastic, much better suction cups - which would easily earn it a 5 star rating. But for what it is, I’m happy to have it. If it lasts, it’ll be great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4WZZm+BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4WZZm+BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N4WZZm+BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51g7KZTd7dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51g7KZTd7dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51g7KZTd7dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nlEUf3O7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nlEUf3O7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nlEUf3O7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+9VR2640L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+9VR2640L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+9VR2640L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618V0bEiWWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618V0bEiWWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618V0bEiWWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ow5kUGnYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ow5kUGnYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Ow5kUGnYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VPEKXp2fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VPEKXp2fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VPEKXp2fL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPGh6WHIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPGh6WHIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPGh6WHIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p+e6r1BrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p+e6r1BrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p+e6r1BrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yzdcWI8GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yzdcWI8GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yzdcWI8GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zNZglyXlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zNZglyXlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zNZglyXlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08PP8SHKB,B08PP8SHKB,AHSL6SPJ3F6JQU4TG2UFMHVVQCKA,1611100358080,0,False

5.0,LOVE this perfume!,This Dance Midnight perfume by Shakira is really luscious and sexy! It has a strong floral and musk scent which is a heavier scent. It's very mysterious and breath takingly good. I love it! Even the bottle is sexy. It's a heavier scent that I usually love to wear during fall and winter. In spring and summer I will wear a lighter floral scent. I've worn this perfume 3 times now and get compliments each time. Usually from my husband too.

4.0,Works to dry drippy hair faster after a shower,"The package contained 3 microfiber Towel Wrap Turbans: one pink, one lavender, and one striped (orange, pink, blue, white).

It only takes a teaspoon in the recipe and the other thing about glycerin is that it is sweet, so it blends in well with an ice cream recipe.  My ice cream turned out great and it is smooth and creamy after being in the freezer.  Now, this is not my first use of glycerin as I have used a small amount in water to spray in my hair.

I can truly say that these magnesium salts really do make my feet feel so much better when dissolved in the foot bath water.  Because of my knees, I don't take baths any longer, but if I could easily sit down and get back up in the bath tub, I'd definitely try these salts in a nice long soak in the tub - I can imagine my whole body feeling as good as my feet afterwards!

4.0,"Straight razor with a ""guard""","That's basically what this is.  First off, the box is written in Chinese, I believe, with absolutely no English on it.  No instructions other than a pair of pictures.  Not great pictures either.  Not to be deterred, I opened the box, pulled one of the razors from the box, removed the plastic cover and tried it.  If you look closely at the one picture, you will see what appears to be a drop of blood - it is.  That is why I described this as a straight razor with a guard in quotes.  Make NO mistake, these are SHARP.  Use them delicately and only on smooth skin.  If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off.  You will bleed.

This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums.  I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring.

5.0,It' Pretty Good,"Saw this puppy discussed a lot on various shaving sites. They all said that you have to watch the YouTube videos to get the right technique for lathering. I watched a couple and have been trying this now for the past several weeks. I must have tried close to 40 different soaps, creams and sticks from the most expensive to the not so expensive. This one is right up there in terms of face glide and lubrication.Certainly in the top quintile. Why 4 stars? I have tried every variation to get a lather but there is no getting around that this is the most difficult soap I have ever tried. Too much water, too little water it seemed impossible to get it right the first time. No matter what I tried it seemed to either be too foamy and thin or not enough water to generate a lather. It's as if the gremlin in the soap puck was contrary enough to defeat whatever I tried until the 2nd or 3rd try.<br />Bottom lime- With effort and persistence it gets the job done and the fragrance is mildly pleasant but it will never be my ""go-to"" product. I'll stick with may favs: Kiss My Face, Cella and Proraso cream.<br />UPDATE:<br />Gave it another try with a little more patience. It seems that the end product you want is a little on the thick creamy side and not really a ""lather"". If you wet your brush, turn it over and let all the water drip out that you can,then you apply brush to soap and be patient and determined you will get the thick rich cream that will do the trick. One other tip I found after you apply the cream to the face let it sit for about 20-30 seconds before you apply your razor. You will then get the greatest glide you will experience. Accordingly I have moved it up the top tier and displaced the Proraso cream.I would give it 4 1/2 stars, and not 5, if I could because of the difficult lathering.<br />FURTHER UPDATE<br />After using this puppy for a little while I have come to master it and love it. Great for glide and closeness and absence of irritation. I originally rated it a 4 but now after careful consideration I must admit that it deserves a 5 star rating. Its among my top 3 favorite shaving products.",[],B001LY7FRK,B001LY7FRK,AE6PIIY7MY6OQJKTMSFRVKTXO36Q,1393491641000,1,False

5.0,Awesome Kit of Generously-Sized Minis!,"This travel set of products is a complete winner for me, and the sizes are generous for minis.

The two liquid products go on so thin and seamlessly, that it’s the perfect amount of primer to smooth everything out and help the foundation last. Sometimes full-on primers can be a bit too smoothing and it makes me feel like my makeup is going to slide off. Everything is very mildly scented (a mix of fresh & floral), but not overwhelming and the scent doesn’t stick around. The No Pore-Blem primer is nice and works well to smooth out specific zones on my face, but I don't use it all the time. For all over coverage, I prefer the Priming Water, followed by the Prime Essence, which makes my skin look and feel great, and helps my foundation look awesome.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81K8IGY2bTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81K8IGY2bTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81K8IGY2bTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OsijHr2LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OsijHr2LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81OsijHr2LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q+mGUSpVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q+mGUSpVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q+mGUSpVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rBgjIajKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rBgjIajKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81rBgjIajKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08F4ZDVZQ,B08F4ZDVZQ,AEQLRFSCJIRIKSYQ2KQJCIBP4RHQ,1607636921327,0,False

5.0,Pretty addition to a hair style,"My girls are trying to grow out some of their hair from a few years ago when they decided to cut some off with kid scissors. It's taken a while and while it is growing back, it tends to fall in their faces. This set of bows is a nice way to clip that back. You can use them like little clips but they also have bows on them, so they look really cute on them.<br /><br />The bows seem to be good quality, we have used them several times a week for two girls since we got them and none have come undone or had any problems. They are really a good way to make them look put together, even when they decide to pick out their own outfits. These work really well for the front, side and we have even clipped them over pig tails/pony tails a few times and they just look sweet.<br /><br />I am very happy with the quality<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT  (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

5.0,Roomy organizer set,"I have been looking for a way to organize not only my make up, but some small art stuff on my bed side table. This acrylic set is exactly what I have been looking for. The first part of the set is a large organizer with drawers. Each drawer slides out nicely and even has a little black liner inside to help keep the bottom clean and keep things from rolling around. This is especially helpful with make up items, which can leave a mess.<br /><br />The next two pieces both can fit perfectly on top of the organizer. It has an indent on the top that keeps the other organizers from sliding around.<br />One has a curved area and the other has small box like shapes. These work well for make up sponges.<br /><br />It gives plenty of space for keeping everything within reach and organized.

5.0,All natural Luxury,"I have never used a bath bomb, mostly I have used bath salts and made my own bath treatments, but had heard so much about bath bombs that I wanted to try them out for myself. I use essential oils so this one looked especially good to me. There are no funky ingredients or chemicals in it, so that was a huge plus for me. Each of the bath bombs has a name and what it is for. My favorite right off the bat was the grapefruit for energy. I was having a tired day and needed a pick me up, so I took a hot bath with one.<br /><br />The bath bomb took a while to dissolve, so it lasted quite a while, then the water turned lightly colored. It was nice to feel on my toes as it dissolved. The smell was lovely, however it didn't last too long. On the next one I used I just dropped a few drops of essential oils that matched the scent, so it helped it stay scented longer.<br /><br />All in all it is a lovely luxury to pamper yourself or give as a gift.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

4.0,Keeps the skin soft and smooth,"Scrubs are a nice way to get rid of dead skin, so this seemed like a good way to go. It isn't full of a bunch of chemicals and is similar to a salt scrub. It's not all wet, so don't go wiping it on your face without first getting it wet. The best way to use it, in my opinion, it to take a little pinch/scoop of it and add it to your body scrubber. I think an electric face scrubbing brush is fine it you have shower doors or a shower curtain to keep any pieces from flying all over, but this helps get the scrub really worked into the skin. You can also use it on a body sponge/wash cloth or even with your fingers.<br /><br />It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, it's actually quite mild, which is fine because you don't always need to smell strongly with purfumes and fragrances. Over all it's a good scrub and works well for what it is used for.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

5.0,Nice mirror for make up,"I have never been the type of girl to stand in front of a mirror and do make up for long periods of time. I have used a hand mirror for years, I prefer to sit somewhere like a bed or couch and do my make up. Using a hand mirror is harder though because you then only have one hand to work with the make up. While I don't do a ton, opening things like mascara or doing eye liner is a lot harder when you only have one hand.<br /><br />This mirror stands up on it's own, so you don't have to hold it. It has a pretty red exterior and it even lights up. The light is not a really bright one, but enough to light up your face if you are in a room that is not as bright as you would like. The rim lights up on both sides, the regular mirror side and on the zoomed in mirror side. There is a place to plug it in, but no plug, so you can choose that option if you have a plug. I used the 3 AAA batteries that it came with. It works well for me to be able to do my make up without having to stand in the bathroom and I don't have to hang onto a hand mirror.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

5.0,Really big bottle! My husband loves it,"My husband has a very thick beard, and maintaining it is a lot easier with some beard oil. This bottle took me by surprise, it has a dropper top similar to those in essential oil bottles (which makes sense with the dark blue bottle and it being made with oils like jojoba)<br />The oil goes on easy, he can just shake a few drops out and rub it in.<br /><br />He uses a boar bristle brush to help him get the oil down to the skin, it helps his beard stay softer and it has grown a lot longer than he usually lets it get. By now he usually gets fed up of it being itchy and shaves, but the oil stops the itchy issue.<br /><br />The bottle is 4 ounces, so it will last quite some time.

5.0,Very high quality and professional set,"There are so many uses for tweezers, and I am used to having some from brands like Revlon and such that are okay, but they are not very high quality. The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs.

5.0,"Forget mixing up a powder, this is so much better than that","No one tells you when you are young that your face will break out even as an adult. Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth.

5.0,It actually detangled my extremely thick hair,"I have very thick hair, for a long time I had a mat of tangles at the base of my skull that used to take me up to an hour to detangle. My hair was getting unmanageable so I cut it off. After donating 4 pony tails to locks of love, as my hair reached all the way down to my knees when I was standing up, I thought my hair would be easy to care for. But if I'm not careful, I still get very bad tangles in my short hair. Now that I am starting to grow it out again, I thought my troubles would be back, but I received an opportunity to try this brush at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased, review. (all opinions are my own) I took my hair down from it's ponytail and ran the brush through, figuring it would get caught fairly quickly. To my surprise, it didn't really snag at all. It actually did as it claimed. My hair was smooth and the spot at the base of my skull that always gets missed no matter how hard I try, was also smooth and untangled. I am really shocked. I have tried so many brushes for myself and had sort of given up on finding something just for me.

I am such a fan of all natural products and even more a fan of essential oils and now my hair looks and feels like i had a spa day that was in the comfort of my own home. Argan oil is effective in thoroughly cleansing and improving the health of the scalp, removing any impurities, and acting as a natural antidandruff remedy. Which is something i truly need since i have a super sensitive scalp and water even seems to bother it alot of the time.  It also contains pure organic argan oil that works to leave the scalp feeling refreshed while locking in moisture and shine into each strand of hair. I am so delighted to come across this product and used it this is one that I will use for a very long time and highly recommend it to everyone else.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review thank you","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813j6qxBGpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813j6qxBGpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813j6qxBGpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813vW6XYtkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813vW6XYtkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813vW6XYtkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B5fp8rinL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B5fp8rinL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B5fp8rinL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LyIx2Q55L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LyIx2Q55L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LyIx2Q55L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B012Q9NGE4,B012Q9NGE4,AEVVEYZF4MQDPC2BY2HBBNGZRYHA,1451884039000,2,False

5.0,This little bugger works!,"I'll be honest.  I was rather skeptical when I received this.  It looks sleek and pretty but does it actually work?  My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.  I think the price for this item is fantastic!  I have a reduction in blackheads, my skin seems to glow after use, and my products are sinking into my skin better and faster.

4.0,Cool once you get the hang of it....but the price...,"I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719HHd88KKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719HHd88KKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719HHd88KKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Q82VGTV,B07Q82VGTV,AGSTQ3JDGW2TZB5XKBF7PD2DJOKQ,1565792228274,8,False
3.0,I'm not sure this is worth the price asked...,"I've always wanted to get into the art of doing my own acrylics so when I saw this drill set, I knew I had to review it.  Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.

4.0,Worth a try!,"This kit is a great deal!  I've been a devoted user of Korean skin care products.  For a while, I have preferred, out of several brands and types of sheet mask, the Benton Bee and Snail sheet mask.  Fantastic product!!!!  Firms, smooths, soothes.  It's great.  However, that's not why I purchased this set.  I have combo skin that leans towards oily in the heat.  Super oily T-zone.  After doing a ton of research, I decided to give the Benton Aloe Gel moisturizer a try.  I'd also heard great things about this foam cleanser.  I'm really enjoying the cleanser so far.  I wet my hands and face, use only a pea sized amount, rub my hands together to create the foam (not a soapy lather, but a thick and creamy foam), and work over my face.  I do this after oil cleansing.  This does a great job of picking up any oil residue and dirt, while leaving my face soft and refreshed.  Never tight and dry, which is the sign of an awful cleanser.  The gel moisturizer is okay.  Just okay.  I don't get as oily as I did with lotion moisturizers, which is great.  However, I don't have that supple, smooth feel that I'm used to and prefer.  I've actually noticed flaking around my nose, which is something I never dealt with after moisturizing.  A pea sized amount covers my entire face, it leaves a slightly tacky finish until absorbed ( I always let each of my products absorb for around 90 seconds before applying the next step), and is completely colorless.  Will I repurchase?  No, but I do suggest that you give this a try if your research and needs point you this direction.  Everyone's skin care needs can vary on several levels.  There are universal musts for good skin health, like cleansing daily, moisturizing, and using a good sunscreen.  There a a ton a variations of those products, though.  Finding the right routine and products can be a trial and error process.  The main thing is to stick to it.

5.0,Glad Honest for Men finally got it sorted out and offers two varieties - one exfoliating and one not,"Gotta take a moment to write a review because this is my favorite soap.  The other kind they make (the non-exfoliating kind) went through phases - first it was exfoliating, then they got bad reviews because it was TOO exfoliating (which I absolutely loved about it), then they removed ALL of the exfoliation and got bad reviews because there wasn't any exfoliation any more... and finally they got it together to have two varieties, one without any exfoliation, and one with exfoliation - this one.  And the other one is now stuck with a 3 star review average just because of that mix-up.<br /><br />At first I was nervous that even with the exfoliation back (this one), it would not be as good as it was before when it had the exfoliation originally, because it used to be oatmeal for the exfoliation, and now it is coffee grounds.  I even sent them a note asking why they didn't use oatmeal any more, and they said it was because the oatmeal version would fall apart in the Amazon warehouses.  But I tried the coffee ground exfoliation - and even though it isn't quite as good - it's still great.  This soap beats any other I've tried to purchase, and I have purchased about 10 brands through Amazon that all said they were exfoliating.  Only one of them was exfoliating enough, and I like this one better.  (I forget the name of that other brand right now; I'm at my computer.  If someone really wants to know, add a comment and I'll dig it up.)  I really need a very strong exfoliating soap, and this one actually is strong enough.  It also happens to be a brown bar with a decent hearty soap material, as well - not phony - so it is all I need.<br /><br />Just wanted to post this review to start to bring back some 5 stars for this company now that they've gotten things sorted out and have two varieties, one exfoliating and one that isn't.",[],B017MQFZEK,B017MQFZEK,AGQAF7RICNAWTZP34KRA2YCZLPPA,1455422823000,15,True

People like me, who can't find strong exfoliating soap from any other brand (I have specifically ordered at least 10 other brands, Loofah, etc. etc. just trying to find one with strong exfoliation - and none have it, except maybe Tasmanian (http://amzn.com/B00CQOHOXY (but this is better)), can now use Honest For Men again - their exfoliating line.  So not this listing, but the other listing.  Not that exfoliating soap should matter, but actually, I'd be scrubbing with rocks from brooks if humans lived out in nature.<br /><br />*** Original review a few days before ***<br /><br />This was my favorite soap - and I depended on it for the fantastic exfoliation, better than any other I've tried (and I tried a dozen kinds).<br /><br />All of a sudden, in this last batch, they have simply removed the exfoliation completely.

There are 1,000 other soaps that you can buy with various interesting scents, etc.  But this was the only soap you can buy that had great exfoliation.<br /><br />And now they've removed it.<br /><br />Hopefully, the 'customer feedback' that caused them to remove the exfoliation will be blasted away by the customer feedback complaining that the exfoliation is missing, and they'll put it back.<br /><br />In the meantime - goodbye, 'Honest for Men'.",[],B00IPRGRW0,B00IPRGRW0,AGQAF7RICNAWTZP34KRA2YCZLPPA,1446443635000,3,True

5.0,Great hair diffuser,"I've been trying to get better about regularly going to a salon for a hair cut. For years I just went to Great Clips once a year.

I read reviews that sometimes this hair diffuser doesn't work on all hair dryers because the diameter is smaller or larger than what this is compatible. But I measured the diameter of my hair dryer so I knew it would work. And I love how my hair reacts to being diffused. My curls just look marvelous.

I recommend getting some tutelage on a forum or youtube about care of horsehair brushes- Being a bit of a masher (my old boar brushes are pretty splayed), I wound up with a bit of a birdsnest in the center of the brush which i had to detangle. I was immediately disappointed and shelved it- I was going to try and sell it. But the few great shaves I had made me want to try to use it right and now, with less pressure (ease up if it feels scratchy at all) and slightly different motions (figure 8s instead of circles, incidentally) I get great lather (using tabac) and the brush doesn't tangle- and it's even smoother and softer on the face.

5.0,The best.,"After having used this product for a month, I find myself hooked.  As YMMV when taking someone's word on shave gear, I thought I might provide some background about me:  I have gentle to oily skin and stiff, tough neck hairs.  I used to think I had sensitive skin until I married someone with actual sensitive skin.  But the combination of the tough hairs and the gentleness of my skin leads to irritation on the neck when I am not careful.  I learned to shave with a gillette adjustable years ago(which I still use), but out of &#34;convenience&#34; (really, a lack of good shaving products and knowhow) I stopped using it for cartridge systems in my early twenties.  Since I started shaving right, some time ago, I got an EJ-89 which I use when I'm feeling raw, and an old type open comb gillette (which, for the moment at least, I favor for its closeness- I use personna lab blue blades or sharper in it).  I've tried a number of different soaps and a few creams, most of which are good.  Mitchell's is excellent.  It has a simple, clean smell like fresh linen and is the most thoroughly hydrating shaving product I have ever used.  It lathers up easily-  I've used my beat up old drugstore boar brush which is now probly 15 years old and a silvertip badger brush.. In either case, the lather whips up in a minute or less with no complications.  I'm not one of these people that soaks the puck either, I just heat it up in its dish, in a basin of hot water as I soak my brush and it is good to go.  I've heard that water hardness and temp can make a difference with this stuff, but as I have decidedly soft water here in the city, I can't really comment on that.  But once you get the lather right, with enough water, it is eaaasy on the face.  Amazing even..  I dreamt wetshaving was like this as a teenager..<br />  One might be put off by the price which may seem hefty for a newcomer to the wetshaving game, eager to start saving money (previously lost on walking the cartridge treadmill) and reticent to buy apparently expensive luxury shaving soaps, but aside from being a quality product, It lasts for a quite a while.  I was really going to wait until I had exhausted mine to write this review but it's been a month, and the puck looks basically the same size!  Growing up on Williams soap and favoring Van der Hagen as a drugstore standby these days, I notice one soap generally lasts me a month (some less than that), but aside from the simply larger size of Mitchells (4.4 oz to 2.5 oz for standard mug size soaps), you just get more bang for your buck.  I'm guessing this one will last me three months or more.. So at that rate, the price basically factors out altogether.<br />  To sum up, if you have gentle or easily irritated skin and aren't looking for a heavily scented product, this is the grail of soaps for you.

3.0,It works.... Just not how it claims too.,"After reading the reviews about nail bed damage and how well this helps the soak off I ended up getting it.<br /><br />Firstly, it does peel a little nail bed up, so the damage thing is accurate. I wouldn't suggest using it &#34;as advertised&#34;. However, after nudging off one nail I dis the standard coarse board, polish remover soaked cotton balls, wrap my fingers in foil thing. The soak off is MUCH easier with this as the base coat. They come off faster, more cleanly and leave behind no damage.<br /><br />I'm only giving it three stars for a few reasons. It doesn't do what it says it should do. It does lift. On my second try, after the first experiment, I did my nails again. Several nails lifted and peeled. Some came completely free with no damage. Usually my gels outlast my level of interest, and I soak them off before I even go the full two weeks. These definitely have a gripping problem. That's not a negative for me. It makes polish changes easier. However, it mean that they don't do what they're supposed to do.<br /><br />Bottom line, the things about this product that make it convenient for me are counter to what the product is advertised as doing. I imagine that would make it a poor buy for many a gel lover.",[],B00TA5JLP6,B00TA5JLP6,AHL52MRYTLYP6UHLL35B4YI4BQ5A,1460147711000,4,True

I can't really do anything when these are on my hands, but they feel nice and I like relaxing with them. Also, the black heart on the outside actually turns red when the wax gets really hot. I used mine in the microwave, and it worked really well.<br /><br />They have a unique design, which is basically a plastic hand wrapper that has a spongy interior, and the sponge holds all of the paraffin wax so that it delivers it right to your hands. It also stays hot for a pretty long time, which surprised me that all the heat didn't dissipate really quickly.<br /><br />These are made for average hands, so if your hands are giant, then these might be hard to fit into. But, they should work pretty well for most hands. Also, they're great for the first treatment, but for subsequent treatments, it's really tough to keep the wax in the sleeve while microwaving.<br /><br />But, overall, they're awesome for disposable paraffin treatments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Makes your hands feel silky smooth<br />+The spongy interior absorbs and holds most of the wax<br />+The heat indicator really works<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May not last a full five treatments<br /><br />*TGN gave me this wax to review*",[],B00SLMLOSQ,B00SLMLOSQ,AHM2XKCUWJ4GZQNGDGNEVEN7FJYQ,1439764829000,2,False

We'll see how that works :-)  I wish I'd gotten the more solid, dark blond or light brown.  I purchased the 18&#34; extensions based on other reviews that said they are very thin at the bottom -- I wanted more thickness to my hair, not more length (although I would have been open to additional length if that worked out) and I wanted enough length that I could trim them, if needed.  I'm glad I did this -- I was able to cut off about 2&#34; of very wispy ends to match my own hair length.  When I clipped them in before cutting them to length, the wispy ends looked obvious and weird where they extended beyond my own hair length because there just wasn't enough hair at the ends to look right.  In any case, when I cut them to match my own hair length, they did exactly what I wanted -- I ended up with a nice thick braid.

For the generic acetone remover I just apply and wipe with a cotton ball.<br /><br />The Pure Body Naturals™ remover wiped right off, taking most of the polish with it. I did have to reapply a small amount, wait a few more minutes and all but one tiny trace of the red polish was gone.  The acetone remover left polish near my cuticles even after a hard scrubbing and a second try.<br /><br />So what did I like?<br />-I like that it works better than the acetone remover, even on the darkest red and glitter!<br />-I like that it did not make my nails feel dry.<br />-I like that the Pure Body Naturals™ remover doesn’t have harsh chemicals.<br />-I like that it isn’t tested on animals.<br />-I like that it comes with a handy glass dropper.<br /><br />The only problem (and it could have been a BIG one) is this polish will eat through any polish, including vanish on my dining room table and styrofoam plates. No kidding. I started out thinking to drip the remover over a plate to keep it off the table but it quickly melted the styrofoam and one small spot of the table varnish.<br /><br />Only use this stuff in the bathroom over tile or a sink with no finish/paint/lacquer, etc. never over a delicate surface like your dining room table!<br /><br />I received a free sample of this remover to review.  I have given my honest opinion and the real test/comparison results.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517GGxaDj5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517GGxaDj5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517GGxaDj5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XSWAU7-tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XSWAU7-tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XSWAU7-tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51baj+05nzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51baj+05nzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51baj+05nzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AYTGWA8,B01AYTGWA8,AEIQYITO3JD7NNKO7EP3XLQHPO6A,1459880079000,34,False

5.0,New Maybuy Beard Trimmer Takes On Viking Beard -- And Wins!,"The gene pool I come from has Viking, German, and Irish heritage -- resulting in a stiff wiry beard that defeats most cordless beard trimmers.  To give this trimmer a good chance I followed the directions and charged it for the two hours as recommended in the instructions.  My only gripe about this process is that you're supposed to keep an eye on it so that when charging is finished you can disconnect it immediately to avoid potential damage.  Since the unit has no automatic shut-off when charging is completed, you have to keep an eye on it to avoid a problem.  That is my only gripe about this unit.  Not too many people have the time flexibility to watch it for the two hours (or less) it needs to charge.<br /><br />While it only comes with 3 attachments that is all you really need.  The shaver itself is large enough to give you a firm grip and the weight implies quality.  The initial effort at trimming my beard was highly successful.  I grew it for two weeks to make it a challenge and then shaved it without using any attachments.  Normally (with other units) I would have expected difficulty in shaving it flush with my skin. Typically this type of trimmer is not powerful enough to plow through my beard, pulls some hair out instead of cutting it, and sometimes nicks my skin.  None of that happened here.  Evidently the battery and the motor are up to the task.<br /><br />This is by far the best cordless trimmer I have ever owned and used.  Highly recommended!",[],B078SWLT3L,B07HR5QSN2,AHPUNNPYLLQZSV56MUEOGSHANASQ,1536586753158,6,False

3.0,"It's pretty good, I guess","I'm not well versed in extensions and the like, but thought this was a great idea to change things up every once in a while. The hair itself is beautiful. No shedding issues, no unusual tangling and no weird smells. I was able to straighten if I wanted to and once washed, it went back to it's beautiful natural texture.<br />My only issue with this is the net is huge and I had issues with how to apply it without it bulking up. As I said, I'm not the best with these things but it seems that this piece could be a bit smaller. My 2nd issue is that the strip of hair to wrap around to secure is very thin. I've seen others that are thicker w/ more hair, which makes it easy to hide where the fake hair is secured to your actual ponytail. My 3rd issue is the velcro kept getting caught on my real hair. You have to be super careful but since it was a bit difficult to secure because of the huge net, sometimes I was going so slow that the hair would shift and I had to start again. Kind of hard to explain but I think if I could apply this without worrying about pulling my hair out, it would be easier to secure.

NOPE.  The edges kept lifting up and the lash fell off after a couple of blinks.  OK I thought, maybe my liner wasn't thick enough, so I applied another really good coat and then tried the lash again....Same results.  I then washed my eye again and tried with my other liner and the lash stayed on like it should.<br />I like the lashes very much.

5.0,"My hair LOVES this product. Provides a well-defined, extremely moisturized and bouncy twist out.","This is an extremely moisturizing cream that my 4a/4b hair absolutely drinks up!! My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).<br /><br />I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.<br /><br />The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out  (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.<br /><br />This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy.

I've had some (from other brands) that have broken on me after just a week or two - these have not done that.<br /><br />They're really great quality and can hold quite a bit of hair. My hair is really thick and tightly curled and I can easily part my hair into just 6 sections and hold each section tightly and securely with these; they're definitely strong and flexible.

Because of the angle, you'll need to open your mouth extremely wide to floss your molars with the ribbon floss.

3.0,Roller Ball May Not Be the Best Mode of Application,"I've been using this serum for 5 days, AM and PM.  I believe I see some minor reduction in the lines under my eyes...but it could be wishful thinking.  I am not convinced there is always serum coming out while rolling it on because the nature of steel is that it feels cool to the touch, therefore can give the impression of depositing serum when, in fact, it isn't.  To determine this I ran it over white tissue several times; only about 50% of the time did serum actually come out.  I removed and cleaned the steel roller ball as directed then reran my ""experiment"" and had the same results.<br /><br />During application I can briefly detect a damp look where it is being deposited, but this goes away within seconds.  At other times nothing is on the surface of my face and immediate dabbing with a tissue proves there is no serum.  I am not convinced this is the best mode of application.<br /><br />If, after a couple of months of use, I see definite wrinkle reduction I will happily update my review accordingly.",[],B07DXJVHR1,B07DXJVHR1,AEE53DTIR6I2OOZGRK5W6Z7RQRHA,1535674712061,0,False

4.0,Easy to use,"Pre-pandemic my hubby would go get his hair trimmed before it got too long. During lockdown and beyond, he didn’t want to risk getting sick for a hair cut since I’m high risk. So he decided so long as he’s working at home, he was just going to let it grow to enjoy longer hair while he could. As it got longer he started asking me how I people with longer hair tie their hair back without getting a headache. I told him we don’t. Then got offered this for review so I snatched it up.<br /><br />It helps a lot because it’s not a solid band, so you can sort of tighten it and/or take it off without yanking half of your hair with it. Takes a little tweaking and getting used to. Not sure how it would hold up to more complicated styles, but for just holding your hair back in a pony tail, it’s pretty decent.",[],B099RVDJHW,B09VH7M73X,AHPAXGZTH4KAGQHOWQ4SGU4BN23Q,1650493189573,1,False

I suspect I’ll end up tearing out the knot and re-sew it to be just a wide headband instead, I think they’ll fit me better and not slide around as much that way.<br /><br />Overall: if you find you can wear most fabric headbands without issue, you’ll love these. If you find this style of headband is a gamble where some fit awesome and others slide around or if you have a larger head, these will probably not be your faves.",[],B095YJMPS3,B095YJMPS3,AHPAXGZTH4KAGQHOWQ4SGU4BN23Q,1627671754701,0,False

As someone with thin, fine hair that has been kept short for years, I think it may be almost too much hair for me.  I may have to trim it some so that it won’t feel so overpowering.  The hair itself looks decent enough that it could probably be  a daily wig for most.",[],B07YYW1913,B07YYW1913,AHPAXGZTH4KAGQHOWQ4SGU4BN23Q,1580176255761,0,False
4.0,"Vibrant color, but very messy.","I'm posting a pic of my hair pre-bleach, post bleach, and post pink dye. I probably didn't need to bleach it but the last time I tried to dye my hair with pinks (two different brands) it just didn't take very well.<br /><br />This took very well. The kit includes all you need (I used different gloves just because I prefer others). The directions are simple and complete. I would say that if you have hair longer than chin, maybe shoulder length, you will need at least two boxes. I have a pixie cut and used about half of both the bleach and dye. I always follow the direction when bleaching and did follow their directions. I never follow directions when using these &#34;Direct dye&#34; bright colors. Instead of the 30-60 minutes, I left mine in for 5 hours. I got a very vibrant pink (a little more fuchsia than the pictures on the box).<br /><br />My one complaint is that this definitely left me with more dye rubbing off than some other brands have. When I used other brands I might wake up the next morning to a streak light on my pillow and that was with lot of hair. Using this on short hair, my pillow looked like a pink paintball fight happened. This and all dyes like it will dye anything and everything they touch. So I highly recommend two things - 1. protect everything (your skin around your face and neck with Vaseline) 2. If possible do NOT rinse your hair in a shower/bathtub. If you have access to a stainless steel sink or some kind of utility / laundry room sink where stains won't matter, that is so much easier to clean.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hQEFZL+uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hQEFZL+uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hQEFZL+uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B001540XWK,B001540XWK,AHPAXGZTH4KAGQHOWQ4SGU4BN23Q,1441935489000,4,False
4.0,Looks very natural on me,"I got this wig yesterday and wore it to a family event and some people didn't know it was a wig. The color is about as dark as my hair would be if I dyed it soft black, which I do sometimes. The curls are a little on the POC side (not the curl type/pattern necessarily, but rather the volume at the root) so I found that bobby pinning some bits down in the back or wearing a headband helped it look more natural for a pale jewish girl. The hair is very soft and doesn't irritate me like my synthetic wigs. However, I think they sent me the wrong length, but I'm not upset about it - for a human hair wig that's this versatile (read: can be worn by a white girl) this price is really great and I understand that on their end things might be hectic. I got a bad haircut a week ago and wasn't able to leave my house, was super depressed, crying all the time when i saw a mirror. This wig is a great solution as the semester is starting in one week and I absolutely have to be on campus. It's less hot than other wigs I have, and I feel confident that this looks natural enough to pass as I start meeting new people at my new school. One thing though is that the wig I received is NOT lace front. Since I gave it full bangs, that doesn't really matter, and I don't care that much about that in general because I will make sure to have bangs with any wig, but I thought it would be lace front and it would have been my first so I was disappointed it wasn't. If you're looking for only lace front, skip this one. But overall I'm giving it 5 stars because I really can't imagine the quality for the price being any better than this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EWwTWNk2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EWwTWNk2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EWwTWNk2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07T9CLFLB,B07T9CLFLB,AEYEPPVDWGP6TEOCANPUN447BULA,1566237856689,2,True

2.0,Not What is Advertised,"This wig is a big disappointment.  I loved the style of the cut in the photo and that is why I ordered it.  I use to wear that hair style when my natural hair was thicker.  And I liked the color in the photo, too, even though I am a chestnut.  But the wig and the hair color are not anywhere near what is advertised.  The style is flat in the back, not adorable like it is the profile photo.  The color is more strawberry red with ugly flat cream colored highlights: not blond.  I tried styling it with the curling iron and it didn't seem to take the curl.  But I had the iron on the lowest setting, because I didn't want to burn the wig.<br /><br />It can't go back, so I'm stuck with it.  I'll either donate it to our local theatre group or I'll try cutting it and restyling the cut.

5.0,Love it,"This makeup set is gorgeous let alone a great quality. It comes in a soft leather case with straps you rap and tuck to close making it possible for you to add a few extra items in side. It makes the bag a bit more adjustable if you wish to include a mirror, makeup wipes or even a small flat bag with a few makeup items for on the go.<br /><br />The brushes all have a wooden handle that feels wooden and not plastic or overly painted. The piece in the center that hold the brush to the handle is fermly attached and does not wiggle or feel loose or missed sized at all. The bush brissles themselves and soft and gental on your skin while still being ferm enough to sweep the makeup exactly in the spot you mint for it to go.<br /><br />Most of the brushes are cut in a tapered cut and only one was blunt excluding the eyebrow brush. There are a few strans on a few of the brushes that needs a quick trimming but this does not cause a problem to do.<br /><br />The hairs do not shed and fall out even if you were to pull the extra few longer hairs out. I have only seen maybe 4 hairs comeout even after pulling on them to check or while brushing them across my face.<br /><br />Each brush is packages with a plastic sleave to protect the brushes. this plastic can be tossed out. Some of the brushes has a more thick plastic on the brissles themselves to protect them and these are reusable.<br /><br />My lipstick brush was damidged when I got it. The harder plastic cap had bent back half the hair and they would not straiten back out. I did call and ask for a return because I really needed this brush. Once I send it out, I do plan to get a second to replace the one I am having to send back. It is a great quality.<br /> Update, I googled a lot of ways to fix your brushes. There had to be a way to fix it.  since it was the only flaw in the entire Bset, I had already opened it and even used it before I even noticed the damage brush I  wanted to give a shot at not having to return my product. I tried out a few  things to fix the bristles. I found that wedding them, wrapping them in tissue then taping it together  or just use saran wrap, I left it overnight and the  here's were straightened the next day.

I tried that also, and found that while it brightens my face a bit, I do still need to apply a moisturizer over it to get proper hydration for my dry skin.  This serum has a very subtle, barely noticeable scent which is pleasant.<br /><br />Sadly, the pump dispenser on the bottle I received does not work at all. It does turn to lock and unlock, but no matter what I did the pump did not work.  So in order for me to use it I have to unscrew the cap every time, pull the pump tube out, and wipe some product from the pump tube.  This serum is very thick and more like a gel, so it is way too thick to tilt the bottle and expect a drop to come out.

4.0,Good for Europe travel,I bought this because of the dual voltage charger that I could use while in Germany. I have long thick hair so it takes longer than my home wand to curl all my hair. I was able to finagle this curling iron and use it like a wand so the curls weren’t so curly cue but rather more like wand waves. My only complaint is that it ran out of charge halfway through my hair (lasted 20 minutes) and then took well over 30 minutes to recharge. So just prepare for that. Thinner hair would probably last a whole charge.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PA52ReLlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PA52ReLlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PA52ReLlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07QRT4VZK,B07QRT4VZK,AESAD6MF452LQYYXPCEQGJ5IEZ5Q,1570668638295,1,True

Once you soak it in water though, it becomes very soft and malleable. The sponge alone is a 5/5.<br /><br />The cleanser on the other hand isn't a favorite of mine. It does not have an inner seal and the smell is just meh. I don't know how another reviewer got a citrus smell since the ingredients don't include fragrance. I think the cleanser is a little too harsh and drying for my skin, it might be better for people with very oily skin.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716q5QjpnGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716q5QjpnGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716q5QjpnGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0854NXJX8,B0854NXJX8,AHJHRRDYDSVTCBNY73B4SW2GGIPA,1597335091768,1,True

It's a good, snug fit so the headband doesn't move around and no hair gets loose.<br /><br />Another thing I liked is that it's double wrapped, so the head band is clean and free of dust.

I say reasonably well because in this day and age, 5 years is good but I prefer things to last 20 years like they used too. Sadly; that's not going to happen. The adjustable guide is the best design that I have found. Far better than similar units that use multiple guides that can get lost, damaged and require additional storage space. The turbo function does work, it has enough high power that calling it &#34;turbo&#34; is not only cool but accurate. The charge/low battery lights function well. The vacuum functions well. I've tried other manufactures so called vacuum units and found that not only did they not work they were a total disappointment. This vacuum system works! Removing and installing the guide was a bit tricky at first but you get used to it. The single thing that I miss is the slide up mini trimmer. Frankly; I would rather have that than the vacuum. Still, I like this product and recommend it! I have had it about a year now and it still works perfect!<br /><br />Update: 3 years old and like new!<br /><br />Update: 5 years old, still like new!

5.0,Great little device!,"I love this machine, have 3 of them.  Take easy, proceed gradually!  Remember to replace the blades when they become dull. Edit: to Cindy: the powder from your callous builds up in a cup under the rotary n u have to easily take apart each time n blow it out or shake it, etc. I purchase 1 more when the came down in price. I love these things, much more than Amope. That's sand paper roll going around but these have such a good blade u have to use it responsibly or u can cut your feet, but so effective!!! If used properly!!!!  Go slow as some people have mentioned n be persistent. A couple times a week go over your feet for a few minutes. My feet were like that gentlemen's. I too was on my feet up to 16 hours a day. My feet cracked n bleed. The best moisturizer on market right now i think is Curel Hydratherapy. I have asked Derms at work n they usually say Curel. Vanicream is excellent but I find it too greasy. After using this device hydrate your feet n place cotton stockings on. Do this at bedtime too if it's really bad. I love this product, im sorry if some of u have had mechanical problems. I've used 4 of mine n I had one problem w the wire getting broken inside. I called the company n they sent out a new wire immediately. My feet are silky smooth!!  What a mess they were 15 years ago!!!!  TO JOE:  are u reviewing the correct product?  I have 4 of these because I loved them so much n never wanted to be without n u r describing this device incorrectly.  You do no charge this unit. It comes with an electrical cord like an iron n that provides electricity/power. There is no charging. I've had the 1st models n the last for sale models n I think I r reviewing a different device. Another edit!  The customer who said this isn't supposed to be an electric sander is correct.  Yes, it stops if too much pressure, it's suppose to. Another customer said the blade was not rough enuf. Yes, eventually u will need to replace blades, but metal against skin should last quite awhile. I bought several blades when they came down in price. The customers that don't like it seem to be using it incorrectly from the start n misunderstanding the mechanics of it.  It's really great n sad Amazon is not selling it right now.

4.0,"Nice salon-quality cuticle pusher with nail cleaner tool, with a minor caveat.","I have been looking for a stainless steel cuticle pusher to use for home manicures - this one is nearly identical to the one used by my manicurist, it has a nice weight to it, is comfortable to use, and is salon-quality.  I use it with the CND CuticleAway Cuticle Remover gel, and it works just as expected.  The nail cleaner end is a nice touch - I prefer this style to the ones that have flat or split trimmer blade ends.<br /><br />One caveat - the edge on the pusher end is sharp - you need to be careful of the pressure and angle used which pushing your cuticles back, as holding the tool at the wrong angle and/or using too much pressure may result in damage to the top layer of your nail (e.g. the tool may shave a slight bit off). I used my Dremel with a fine sanding bit to dull the edge on the pusher end; this resolved the issue for me. If you don't have a Dremel, I suggest taking an emery board to smooth the sharp end before use in order to avoid damaging your nail.<br /><br />I paid FULL price for this cuticle pusher, and did not receive any incentives or discounts in exchange for this review.",[],B01EW5EGUS,B01EW5EGUS,AGFHI7STPJCZWRVZO22PBIZTMXEQ,1508522761789,0,True

1.0,Poor Quality Cushion Flattened Out Immediately,"I have been battling with coccyx pain for several months and needed a cushion that would support me while suspending my tailbone above the seat.

My tailbone was subjected to the same issues of compression and pain that I have with no cushion at all.  In fact, it actually made the problem worse, because the foam in this cushion has so little substance that it crawled around underneath me and bunched up under my bottom, creating a large, uncomfortable lump right at the site of the pain!  I desperately needed a cushion made of dense, firm, high quality foam, and this is simply not up to that standard.  I returned it immediately.<br /><br />The fortunate thing is that the seller was easy to deal with, and was both cheerful and prompt with my refund.  THEY EVEN REFUNDED MY RETURN SHIPPING!

5.0,Stone Crop Serum for Face,"[[ASIN:B01F7K1CRC Stone Crop Serum for Face - Natural Skin Lightening Reduces Pigmentation & Dark Spots on Skin, Attacks Wrinkles & Fine Lines - Vitamin C, E & B Complex - 1oz]]<br /><br />I was looking for a good serum to help my face look good for my upcoming wedding. I am a little older than my fiance but I didn't want my face to show it on my special day. I take the best care of my skin to try to keep it as youthful as possible, so when I had the opportunity to try this serum, I was happy to do so. The serum comes in a screw top and eye dropper dispenser. The bottle is a dark amber colored glass bottle. There is one fluid ounce in the bottle. The serum has a sort of medicinal scent, not unpleasant and not too strong. It leave behind no real scent once it absorbs in. The serum feels refreshing and absorbs quickly and thoroughly into my skin. I feel an immediate pleasant tightening effect and the skin looks smooth and supple almost immediately. I've been using the stone crop serum for two weeks which is not really enough time to be able to tell the full effect of the serum on fine lines and wrinkles, but I do notice softening in expression lines in my forehead and in fine lines and that my skin stays better hydrated throughout the day. There is no burning, redness or irritation with the use of the serum and no product residue left behind. The manufacturer offers a 100% Money-Back Guarantee which I appreciate but have never had a problem with Eva Naturals products before. I am enjoying the serum and consider it a good value at under 19.00 delivered to my door and by the fact that a little goes a long way with only one dropper full of serum enough to do my entire face.",[],B01F7K1CRC,B01F7K1CRC,AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,1467571444000,4,False

I want to look good for as long as I can and because of that I've often used Vitamin C serums. I know they are effective and help with aging skin a lot,  My skin has always been a challenge. I have oily skin with large pores and sometimes have uneven and dull skin. I also have some expression lines on my forehead. I wanted to start using this serum as soon as I got it home. The serum comes in a very nice bottle which I like a lot because not only is it pretty but the serum is delivered in an airless pump which distributes exactly the right amount of serum to my fingertips for easy application to my face. Since Vitamin C products are easily oxidized I appreciate the product being dispensed this way so that it protects the serum and keeps it effective. I have been using this serum the morning on cleansed skin after toner, and then again at night before moisturizer on clean skin in the same way. The serum has a nice scent that is not overpowering and it only takes a pump or two of the serum to cover my entire face. The serum doesn't feel greasy or oily and it's just the right consistency to spread easily. There was no burning or irritation with this product, and it absorbs well into my skin with no left over residue. My skin feels smooth, silky and refreshed after I apply this serum as if my face has a refreshing blast of moisture. It looks supple and moisturized for hours and I've noticed my makeup stays on better. I have been using the serum for about two weeks now. Since then I have noticed a lot of amount of improvement in the tone and smoothness of my skin. It doesn't look as dull  and my skin also looks firmer. My skin is more radiant and soft and the expression lines in my forehead appear a little softer and the improved clarity of my skin is noticeable. My skin also looks better when I'm not wearing makeup. My skin has improved a little and I've been asked what had I been doing to make my skin look better? That makes me feel more confident that the serum is working. I am going to continue to use this serum and consider it a good value worth every penny of the asking price here since a little goes a long way.",[],B01699WMHO,B01699WMHO,AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,1467494684000,4,False

Oz./ 100 ml - Inspired By The One Cologne]]<br /><br />I was looking for new scents or signature scents for my future husband and wanted to try this. I like and appreciate the scent of The One Colognes so this was one I wanted my fiance (Bobby) try this scent. Buying signature scents can become quite expensive to say the least and this is a way for us to get an idea of what a scent smells like with Bobby's chemistry without spending thirty five or forty dollars and then not like it. Besides if this cologne scent stays on and lasts a while we may opt to purchase the less expensive cologne. The seller delivered very quickly and we received packaged well. Since this cologne is an Eau De Toilette Spray, it will have slightly more of the oils (10%) that make the spray smell great than just cologne which has about 7% oil. The scent also is delivered in a convenient spray which me and Bobby both like. The cologne actually smells very nice on him. It's a sort of woodsy, citrus masculine scent and you can definitely smell oranges and ginger in it. The One Cologne describes the scent as &#34;Coriander, Grapefruit, Cardamom seed, Tobacco, Basil, Cedar, Ambre, Ginger, Orange Blossom.&#34; Some of those things I have no idea what they smell like, but I'd say this not really a musk based scent but it smells really yummy on Bobby. It takes a little more spray than the original version The One Cologne, however, it's about 1/3 the cost, so I won't complain. It's still pretty strong with a couple of sprays being all he needs. As far as wear, it lasts a long time. It's sensual/manly in it's scent and he said he received several complements on the cologne. It is also a large bottle at 3.3 ounces delivered to the door for under 15.00. We like the cologne and can recommend it.",[],B01ETWZRL6,B01ETWZRL6,AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,1467139321000,4,False

The seller does a fabulous job of packaging and delivering quickly. The parfum is very pretty in it's design in a feminine bottle with a curved feminine design that's cute on my dresser or vanity. I like this parfum. It has a sort of delicious smelling fruity scent that is very inviting, but you can also smell musk and a slight hint of sweet floral undertones like jasmine. The scent is nice and soft and doesn't bother or irritate my senses. The scent is not overpowering. It's super difficult to explain how scents smell but all I can say is it really does smell fantastic and it does stay on for a pretty good while. I like how the scent sort of softens and mellows when I wear it a while. It lasts a lot longer if I spray it on my wrist and other pulse points and lingers in the air.

After all, no one wants to look older or tired. I try all kinds of skin care products and really work hard at keeping my skin in good shape, so I decided I'd give this a try.I was speaking to a friend of mine recently whose skin always looks gorgeous. I asked her what she did to look so good? She is considerably older than me, but has no wrinkling and very pretty skin. She told me that she visits a dermatologist regularly and that she uses a retinol cream and that she pays 60.00 for just a small tube, plus the cost of the doctor visit. Now I am not sure of the strength of the retinoI cream she is using is, and I noticed this is 2.5% so I think that's a pretty effective dosage.The product came in a 1.7 fluid ounce moisturizer. I noticed that the retinol moisturizer also had Vitamin E & B5, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Propolis and shea butter. So I thought about Vitamin A or retinol and what it does for the skin. Vitamin A stimulates and thickens the dermis where collagen, blood vessels and elastin are thereby reducing wrinkles and increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Vitamin A actually expands the deposit of collagen in the skin; therefore slowing down the normal aging breakdown of your collagen and elastin. I've also read when studying skin care (and I really researched it) that Vitamin A increases blood flow and reduces the symptoms of rosacea, helps heal wounds more quickly, repairs cells in the skin and optimizes UV protection, exfoliates to make the skin more smooth, supple and even and even decreases melanin granules reducing brown spots and pigmentation. Vitamin A decreases sebum (oil) thereby treating acne very well and even helps with the eradication of precancerous lesions of the skin and improves hydration. Skins miracle healer!My mother has always used vitamin E. She is in her 70's and still has beautiful skin and is very selective about what she puts on her skin. I've read that Vitamin E has been used in skincare for so long that it sometimes gets passed over for newer, more exotic-sounding ingredients that are sometimes advertised or added to products. But Vitamin E is a highly beneficial ingredient, a strong defense against free radicals and the damage the environment does to the skin. When it’s combined with other antioxidants, It is an exceptional line of defense for your skin.The product is very good quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't leave your face shiny or greasy and seems to absorb within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too tight. There is no build up or product residue. This product has a  nice smell, light and soothing, and is quite easy to use. It's good that the items come in a pump, because exposure to air effects good quality ingredients. A little goes a long way, and the product seems to be lasting a good long time. I use many of Majestic Pure products, and I have had excellent luck with them all and no issues. This moisturizer already is reducing fine line and wrinkles in my skin. It really helps to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. I use this moisturizer on clean skin and I let it soak in, and use under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the cream soak in. This anti aging skin cream keeps your skin supple and moisturized. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried and it works well for me. I am not affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods.",[],B00VXEQ0WO,B00VXEQ0WO,AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,1454382555000,0,False
5.0,Great serum that really works!,"We are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.",[],B0169Y84JE,B0169Y84JE,AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,1453093746000,11,False

When using any DMSO product you must use care to wash and rinse your hands and the area of application well prior to use. Be sure to rub and massage the product completely into the area. Then wash and rinse your hands thoroughly after use. Care must be taken when using this product but nothing to be afraid of if common sense is used. DMSO is a carrier for whatever you have on your skin prior to applying and it will be carried into your system. So you can't apply sunscreen or bug spray for example and then apply DMSO because you don't want those products in your system.,[],B0070Z7KME,B00J7QCNDU,AFVQTQM23HW36W655KNBHZKAUPLQ,1450297679000,41,True

5.0,Much better then the Sonic Spinbrush by Arm & Hammer,"Until a year ago, I never liked the idea of owning an electric toothbrush: I'd owned several cheap ones and never liked any of them. Then I figured that I'd try one again about a year ago and so I chose the Sonic Spinbrush by Arm & Hammer. I chose the Spinbrush because it had a large brush, which I thought meant less time/effort brushing my teeth.<br /><br />The Spinbrush worked pretty well, but the large brush head gagged me horribly. Because of this, I decided to give the Oral-B Vitality a try and I like it much better. The first reason I prefer the Vitality is because it has a much smaller brush head (you don't need a large brush with an electric toothbrush, since the toothbrush is doing all the work.) The smaller brush head also allows me to reach places the larger Spinbrush cannot reach, because it's too big. The Vitality is easier to maneuver in your hand as well, thanks to the smaller handle base.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like about the Spinbrush is how it would click off automatically after 2 minutes (I don't think all models of the Spinbrush do this, though.) The Vitality purposely sputters after 2 minutes for it's timing function, but then continues it's normal operation after a second or two. I still find this annoying, but at least I don't have to remove it from my mouth, dripping with toothpaste, just to turn it back on. And if I finish early, the Spinbrush required me to punch the button twice to stop it (again, something not easy to do with a vibrating toothbrush in your mouth), whereas the Vitality only requires a single button push. These two things alone make the Vitality much more convenient.<br /><br />I also think the Vitality is more powerful then the Spinbrush. The reason you had to push the button on the Spinbrush twice was so you could use it at a lower speed if necessary, but I never found that necessary at all. I prefer the more powerful Vitality, because it feels like it's cleaning better by not slowing down if I push too hard.<br /><br />About the only thing I liked better about the Spinbrush was that it had an indicator light on the base to tell you it was receiving power (I think it gauged the charge, too, but that was never a problem for me.) I'm not sure if that's even important, but it is something I tend to prefer with rechargeable items. Other than that, I love the Vitality and I much prefer it over the Spinbrush. Now I can brush my teeth without gagging and I am thankful for that.",[],B000GBICYE,B000GBICYE,AF7PP5CBJENRLG6K4VDGHBQXVB4Q,1317184471000,1,False

4.0,"Works for some mini polishes, too","I received this product discounted in exchange for a review--I state this disclaimer upfront because that's what I would want to know first, and I too am disturbed by the ratings inflation on Amazon for IEF reviews lately. I do not indiscriminately give 5star reviews, and they are only given for a fraction of products I try that I find are exceptional and I would buy myself at FULL price.  If you wish not to view IEF reviews such as this, click on the filter link to the right of the review section, and then click on &#34;verified purchases only&#34;; that will take most of them out.<br /><br />Well, I'm overall pretty pleased with this product.  I got it hoping I could use it to organize some of my nail polish minis, and it does hold much of my collection.  The mini OPI bottles for the most part fit in the lipstick columns, though not all the way in, for some (strangely enough, the Nordic Collection ones are just a smidge smaller and go in smoothly, despite supposedly being the same exact size).  That was the main purpose of me getting this, so I'm pleased.  I know it was made for other types of makeup, but I already have a system for them; it was all my loose polishes that were driving me nuts.  Please note that you won't get many full-size polishes to fit, though the Essie square type bottles make it easier to get as many in as possible.  As you can see, I had to put some big bottles upside-down to fit more in.  It still had room for my nail brushes, file, foils, tapes, glitters, and cotton balls in the bottom.  The material is a very clear acrylic, but it doesn't feel too cheap.  One complaint I have is the drawers can get a little stuck; but this is common with these acrylic drawers.  Also, the top pc is separate from the bottom drawers, which I don't like.  But these are all minor complaints.  Overall, pleased it does the job.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7164L5j+lqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7164L5j+lqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7164L5j+lqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ORmny6l3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ORmny6l3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ORmny6l3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01B2FA59C,B01B2FA59C,AEVPXPW662NKOPTJMJ4YOZ2VF2OQ,1466180180000,4,False

5.0,Smoothes out frizz in 3 minutes!,"With a teen and a puppy, my mornings are pretty busy. I barely have time to get to my hair before it is time to leave for work. But the frizz is not cute! I find myself pulling my hair into a quick bun, rather than deal with it. This new hair straightening brush is amazing. In 3 minutes I am able to brush the frizz out for a smoother, more polished look. It is fun and easy to use. This brush heats up fast, and does the job. I used to dread washing my hair, because then it was really out of control. This time though, with the brush, it was only 15 minutes to completely straighten my curly frizzy still damp hair. It is the 2nd day - after shampooing and straightening -and it still looks sleek, I didn't even brush it. This product may not be a life saver, but it is a time saver - and it feels good to look good.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dTRBLwAdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dTRBLwAdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dTRBLwAdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01728D3RO,B01728D3RO,AFS6INJFLEC752ETCXLBQHXAL7LQ,1476383059000,1,False

5.0,Wonderful for DIY cleaners,"These are really great bottles for making your own cleaning products. So far, I’ve used these for hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, spray stain remover (hydrogen peroxide and dawn), and a floor cleaner (basically alcohol, soap and water). And they sprayer has been great. They are also pretty and not an eyesore if you have them sitting on your countertop. Since having a baby last year, I’ve become much more aware and careful about what I use to clean with. Through my research, I found that hydrogen peroxide is just as effective as bleach and SO much safer. The problem for me was that of it is exposed to light (a clear spray bottle) it loses its effectiveness. Many people just attach a sprayer to a hydrogen peroxide bottle but I wanted something that looked a bit nicer. The only thing I wasn’t happy about is that, like other reviews have mentioned, it was packaged very poorly. It came in a cardboard box with one piece of a cardboard insert to separate the bottles, and even then it only separated two of the bottles, not all four. Luckily, the bottles weren’t damaged, but I find it strange that I’ve purchased mascara that has come with more padding than these had ;) anyway, it shouldn’t deter you from ordering, because these are great bottles at a great price and if they do get broken in transit, Amazon is excellent at replacing and returning items.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fWh6Qq2DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fWh6Qq2DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fWh6Qq2DL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0759PB3RF,B0759PB3RF,AH33DSGP6JD2BY4GKQOMITFCNFKA,1520441432464,18,True

I have tried at least 30 different products to help with the frizz in my hair. I received a small sample bottle of this in a monthly subscription box I get. A small bottle of this lasted me about 4 months of daily use. I used it right after a wash while my hair was still wet and then right after blow drying and using the straightening iron and then a tiny bit to give my hair that shiny finished, sleek look. Let me tell you, my hair looks and feels like silk after using this. First off, the tangles fall right out. The heat from my iron doesn't damage my hair any longer and my husband says my hair feels like spun silk! This is also a dry oil so there is no oily build up or feel at all. Also, look at the AMAZING price that this is offered at! Wow! I will be heartbroken if they ever stop selling this stuff!<br />Now, there is only one con to this dry black seed oil. It has a small aroma that to me smells like pencil shavings. Almost like when you were in elementary school standing at the pencil sharpener getting your pencils all sharpened up for your tests!  The good news is that the smell doesn't stay in your hair but for a few minutes.

4.0,It could be built better......... but it's still a good/great product,"This is not built very sturdy. T?he base of it, if only it had a metal piece to hold the bottom in place, it would be perfect...... but it has a plastic piece.......... and for this not to be sturdy, is pretty dangerous..<br /><br />I bought it because I wanted to lay my mom under it as often as possible......... and it almost fell on her.............. and almost gave me a heart attack... she didn't even notice, but omg if it had fallen on her...........<br /><br />Yes, that's a really big deal....... but...... I'm not properly set up over here either...... I just reallllllllyyyy think they need to do something about the bottom attachment piece to make this thing completely sturdy, because those lights get HOT!!!..........<br /><br />Also when it showed up one of the lights was broken..... I never said anything to anyone about it though because it was for the night in the middle, and I don't really need that one........ But I probably should have just to get it replaced.<br /><br />The last negative thing is that it makes a pretty loud humming noise while it's on. And depending on the brightness, it gets louder. (oddly it gets louder as the lights go dimmer....)<br /><br />But on a bright note........ I can barely ever actually get my mom to get undressed to actually let the light shine on her skin....... (She doesn't know who I am most of the time, so I can't blame her....... ) but one time I was able to get her to....... we laid under it for probably 45 minutes........ and she was in such a bright and cheery mood after we got up.......... it was awesome.<br /><br />So. Red light therapy really works.......... as far as this product goes.......... the fact that it's not totally sturdy, I think is dangerous, especially if you're in my situation with an older parent......... but it was the best one I could find.

So there's about two month's worth of product I'm missing from the Cream.

3.0,It’s a good unit.,"It’s pretty, but not so functional. The puff isn’t as fluffy or big as I expected. It’s probably 3” wide. The bottom portion is deep, but if you fill it with powder, it over covers the puff too much and ends up getting everywhere, and there’s no way to shake it off because the puff fits tightly into the deep portion and there’s no way to shake off the excess powder. There’s a middle piece with a center knob thing, which is hard to get out because it fits tightly metal to metal, and I have to use my nail to separate it from the bottom portion little by little, or powder goes everywhere, and even doing it slowly, powder spills. I’ve tried putting powder in the center piece, but the knob thing gets in the way, so I have to use the sides of the puff to get powder from the edges, but THATS better than pouring powder in the bottom portion though, because the puff is stored in that area also, and will get covered in powder, which is overkill. The puff literally has to rest on all the powder if you fill it (Don’t!). It’s just not made for easy use, and powder ends up in places I don’t want it, like on any surface you place the container and center knob thing tray. The cost is okay, if it was functional. It just doesn’t make much sense, other than looking cute if you choose a color you like. I just wanted to dip a puff in a little powder for a light dusting after a shower, and this contraption is just more trouble than it’s worth.

I have worn Kiss Impress nails for a number of years.  These nails are prettier (sad is me), but they stay on for up to two and three weeks.

Oh and it dosent come off of the dryer easily which is good (there are silicon prongs on the inside so it fits the hairdyer).

It does start to rub off with eating and drinking, in my experience, but it's not extremely noticeable.

4.0,Great tool to have if you have thick stubborn callus on your feet.,"I had a callus build up on my foot and regular methods and attempts to remove it with a grinder just were not cutting it ... no pun intended. This worked very well at removing the callus by shaving it down then using the other end to smooth it out. The way the blade is mounted makes it safer so you don't accidentally cut yourself but you should still be cautious becuase I can see how it would be possible to cut yourself if your not careful. The handle and angle of the blade helps reach the bottom of your foot easier and it has a protective cover that slides back and forth and snaps into place so you can switch back and forth from using the blade or the &#34;cheese grater&#34;. The only reason I did not give it a five star review is becuase I wish it came with a few extra blades, so you will want to purchase those as well becuase they get dull pretty fast. The other reason is that the other end that I refer to as the &#34;cheese grater&#34; is a thin piece of metal that is curved and snaps/slides into place on the handle and has fallen out a couple times during use. It easily snaps/slides back on and still works well to smooth out the callus.",[],B001HS29LM,B001HS29LM,AH2Z5UYKEP3FU67QLFZNLMRMEAXQ,1439558281000,5,True

3.0,"Good slip, highly recommended","I was given the opportunity to review Keeva's tee tree oil shampoo and fell in love with it right after first use. I wasn't around to when they were selecting reviewers for their conditioner but now that it's available for purchase I'm glade to say I've bought it for full sale price being 20 USD.  Like it's shampoo counterpart the bottle is 28oz total.<br /><br />Texture: White and creamy<br />Scent: Pleasant and definitely not reeking of tea tree oil like it's shampoo sister<br />Slip: Slip is a product's ability to allow one to detangle hair effectively and not need to use too much product to do so. For the amount I used which is pretty standard across the board with all conditioners I've tried, this conditioner is rated at 5/5 for slip<br />Moisture: Next to none but that isn't a real issue due to most of the oils being found in Keeva's tea tree oil shampoo<br />Standout Ingredients: hydrolyzed keratin ( protein ), argania spinose ( Moroccan argon oil ), cetearyl alchol ( fatty alcohol )<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cocos nucifera ( Coconut Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient, however it is featured as an ingredient on the front of the bottle.<br />Melaleuca alternifolia ( Tea Tree Oil ) isn't listed as an ingredient either.<br />Both of these oils is on the front of the bottle being featured however, the product doesn't list the oils as ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I believe this to be a quality conditioner even better than some brands found in salons.

4.0,Grainy but perfectly fine to use,"This shea butter is a good quality shea butter. It is ivory and reasonably priced. As a person whose been using shea butter for well over 10 years for ecezma treatment I can say that this shea butter is a quality product. Although it is a quality shea butter, the way it has been processed left the butter very grainy and not as creamy as I was expecting. It is a thick, heavy butter that is solid at room temperature and has a lot of use for hair and body purposes. It is sourced from an area in Africa that doesn't produce a real rancid smelling butter. It smells distinctly like shea but not like the shea sourced from more eastern countries. The butter when applied to the skin feels thick and heavey but that isn't a problem for me. I would need to indirectly melt and re-solidify this butter in order to smooth it out and kill the grainy texture it comes with. I'd also whip this butter to make it creamy.<br /><br />Price: Reasonable<br />Texture: Grainy but not too smooth, sort of like peanut butter but thicker<br />Color: Ivory, more of an off white, cream like tone<br />Scent: Hard to describe but it's distinctly Shea which never smells pleasing<br /><br />Overall, this company's shea butter is a good quality butter, high quality for some but for me good/decent due to the fact it's grainy and doesn't have the smooth texture I'm used too. The color is normal and the butter feels thick, heavy and heavenly on thick dry skin like eczema.

3.0,Not Recommended At All,"This iron is mediocre in performance and quality. The iron is very heavy to hold and has a semi long heat up time.  This isn't an iron I'd honestly recommend and the price the company charges full price is outrageous for the quality of this iron.<br /><br />My hair texture is 3C/4A and it is relaxer free.  It requires high heats to lay flat.  All of my irons is set to 450 degrees when in use.  Before any flat ironing can begin I start with clean freshly shampooed and conditioned hair. I  then blow dry, prestreching it so that it is easier to iron out.  I use a blow out cream which also protects my hair from heat damage and a vented brush when blow drying. After I'll apply a argon oil serum and a frizz busting serum to my hair.  These oils aide in getting my hair to lay flat with out any frizz.<br /><br />Iron snagged my hair upon first use. I thought that maybe it was user error but it wasn't as the second time I ran the iron across a different section of hair  it was snagged. I also had issues with my iron staying on.  The placement of the on and off switch makes it very easy to turn this iron on and off while in use. The iron didn't even stay plugged in when I was using it.  I was constantly giggling the cord to get it to turn back in.  This iron doesn't glide down a section of hair well.  It is very choppy thus leading to the snagged hair I spoke of earlier.  The iron does swivel while in use making it easy to use.  It goes up to 450 degrees but it's very difficult to maintain any temperature selected on this iron.<br /><br />I don't recommend this iron simply due to the fact it snags at hair. It does work to smooth down hair but it doesn't work well as it cannot  guide down smoothly. The only good thing about this iron is the fact it is very attractive to look at.  I'm happy to say that I didn't pay full price as I received this for a promotional price.

I also wish they came in a refillable container but they do have a little flap to close the package.  The price is very good for two packages at $14.95 with Prime.<br /><br />So if a person is just looking for an eye makeup remover, this is a very good product.

4.0,Makes the straightening process much quicker,"I love how easy this flat iron hair brush is to use. It heats up very fast and gets super hot so do be careful. I have a natural wave to my hair and will use a flat iron to straighten my thick hair. It usually takes me about 15 minutes to get my hair done but with this new flat iron hair brush it only took me 9 minutes. Being a mother of three children, every minutes counts so I was delighted to cut an average of 6 minutes off of doing my hair. I should add that my hair was soft and shiny after straightening likely due to the built in Ionic generator. I also love that it has 5 heat settings allowing me to pick the one that works best for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Heats up very fast.<br />- Easy to use.<br />- Power cord is 78&#34; long and rotates.<br />- Built in Ionic generator.<br />- 5 heat settings with LED display.<br />- Automatically turns off after 45 minutes making it safer to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's heavier than most flat irons.<br /><br />Overall, I really do love this flat iron hair brush. It works well and makes the hair straightening process much quicker.<br /><br />I received a discount in order to test the product. However, I post reviews so consumers can make informed decisions.

5.0,Truly Works!,"I have been using this cream on my stomach and behind/between my thighs, twice a day, for over a week now. I can happily say that I am seeing results! I have been doing patches on my back thighs to help with cellulite but I am only using the cream on my stomach and inner thighs. I am so excited to see how much more dramatic the results will be. I noticed another reviewer was brave enough to post pics of her results and they were amazing. Just be vigilant and apply it twice a day, every day and you should see results.<br /><br />Directions for use are to apply a suitable amount of cream to the target area while gently massaging in a circular, upward motion. You can apply it twice a day, morning and evening.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the results!<br /><br />I received a discount in order to test the product. However, I post reviews so consumers can make informed decisions. Thus, any discounts received have no impact on my reviews. If you have any questions, please leave a comment and I will be happy to help answer them if I can. I hope you found my review to be helpful.

5.0,Amazing Product!,"I waited to write a review on this product because, at first, I was not sure about it.  The product is well packaged and easy to use.  I am 54 years old and after the first night I used it, I woke up the next morning and my face was red and a bit swollen.  At first I thought maybe I was having an allergic reaction.  I noticed after one use my skin was much smoother, as if the top layer of dead skin came off.  I gave my face a few days of a break, as this product seems to be a strong one, and reluctantly tried it again.  I did not have the same reaction with the redness and swelling.  So I kept using this product, but as it is a strong one, I use it only 2-3 times a week.  After about a couple of weeks using it, I discovered all kinds of undesirable things coming out of the pores of my skin, I developed little pussy sores and pimples, but the pimples were not like the regular pimple, these were deep and what came out was really think and sometimes hard.  Instead of having what I thought was an allergic reaction, I think this product was pulling impurities out of my skin and detoxing it.  I also had a couple of small, sebaceous cysts on my forehead and after about a month of using this product, they were gone!  I was told by a plastic surgeon the only way to get rid of them was surgery but I didn't want the scar on my forehead so never had anything done about them, I had them for years.  To this day, the cysts are gone.  My skin no longer reacts as if impurities are being pulled out.  There is still a small amount of burning on the nights I use this product but if I follow it up with argon oil or rose hip oil, the burning goes away.  I've noticed my skin is a firmer, smoother in texture, very soft, and the skin tone is more even.  Although I got amazing results, this product may be overpriced considering it is only ascorbic acid.  Maybe the products in the activator justifies the price but as I'm not an expert on ingredients, I'm not sure.",[],B01KXYOKUI,B01KXYOKUI,AGTXCXUD23UO2XTGGX6OL6SOM7RA,1509293095417,0,True

Well, this is a simple, basic note that to me smells metallic and musky, in a VERY good way!  My nose picks it up very well and it is gorgeous - I will layer my weaker YSL fragrances with it but I will also wear it alone because I like it that much!  To me it is definitely a masculine scent, and I agree w/ others - it probably depends on your skin chemistry with this, which to me is a unique bonus - because that makes it a different scent on every person.  Since this takes 3 weeks to arrive and the bottle is not that big, I will be buying another very soon!

These extension made by Jaunhair are just gorgeous and they are all human hair as I can tell from the styling I do.  The hair is in superb condition, shiny and healthy looking and teh strands feel exceptionally strong. The coloring is beautiful and natural even. I have bought so many tape in extensions for twice and more the price many times that come nowhere near being this beautiful.  I was so please i turned around and ordered more immediately.  I have actually been considering adding some blue and other colors to my hair and I will be buying these extensions to do so so was happy to see some of the colors I wanted were available.

Two magnets weren’t even attached to one of the lashes, but we’re attached to the box. I did try them out but ended up not using them. On my trial run, the one that was missing a couple magnets wouldn’t stay on well, and the other one just felt bulky. The one with all the magnets did stay on! So if you’re used to wearing them it may be something to try.<br /><br />Now, I will admit I’m not a typical lash wearer. I can feel when I’m wearing mascara and eyeliner. I just don’t wear much makeup aside from bronzer and eyeliner. I’m also no stranger to getting dolled up and going a full night at a party in lashes either.

I'm not sure when these fake masks were added, but look up the pictures from this brand on other items.<br /><br />Original Review: Easier option. I wore this mask to protect against the dust storms of BRC and it fit the bill. There are several different types from Vogmask, but mind was a microfiber mask that was very soft and vibrant on the outside, but it had a backing on the inside that did some serious filtering and fit on my face just great. Breathing was never and issue and it was FAR easier than the other method that I brought (over the head construction filter masks) because you can snap them onto your ears and over the mouth in seconds without messing up a costume/wig.
