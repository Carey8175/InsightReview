3.0,It's changed a bit,"It has been several years since I used up my last Ramy B1*&@#-Slap blush, and with Spring coming on full force (it's in the 80's down here in the tropics, I am not making this up) I found myself craving another B-Slap blush for the Spring and Summer months ahead. So I ordered it, thinking that I already know what the color is like so I didn't need to worry about seeing it in person first before buying it. So when the compact arrived, I was surprised to find that the color had changed a bit. Instead of being a neutral/natural pink, it definitely has become a light, cool-tone pink. Now, this really isn't a problem because it's just the right shade and tone that will work very well on my cool-toned complexion, but it ISN'T the B-Slap blush I remember from 6 or 8 years ago. And I feel a little disappointed. I really liked how that almost-but-not-quite warm/neutral pink looked on my complexion. I will still wear it; it's a lovely pink, but it isn't &#34;the old&#34; B-Slap that I remember. Warm-toned girls who used to like the original blush color will have to look elsewhere for this color because this incarnation will look a little too blue-pink on you.",[],B0001428BY,B000LGIFP0,AGQ4A7ZP4BIRDFFCBYTVL5OLS6DA,1362432139000,0,True

5.0,"Great brush, works well, substantial size,  loaded with  bristles","I purchased for my daughter,24, who loves to contour and have fun with her make-up. She also enjoys trying low end and high end products and tools looking for a good price but more important to her is that they work. When I saw this online and read the reviews I bought as a gift. Last year I gave her an expensive contour kit , which she uses daily, so she tried this flat contour brush with that palette. She said it works great for contouring cheeks, forehead and neck area and the brush holds the product well. After feeling the brush for myself- it is extremely soft and filled with short bristles- and seeing the results on her skin I ordered 3 more. One for my daughter in law, myself and an extra in case I need to give a gift!<br />While looking on Amazon and comparing products, prices and reviews, I noticed many of the same brushes, this one, with different prices- some were 5.99, some were 1.99 + 3.98 shipping... so be aware for higher prices for same product.",[],B00WQEJV6M,B00WQEJV6M,AGJHB6K7KJ2E3YTQ5JNGWN5QJ2IQ,1445581878000,3,True

4.0,Better than many other epilators for smooth skin,"I've tried a couple of different types of epilators over the past 15-20 years.  While I was usually happy enough with the results, I rarely used them since it always seemed like you had to wait until the hair got long enough for the unit to grip the hair in order to yank it out.  And rarely did I really want the hair on my legs to reach that amount of stubble.  Not to mention the pain that is involved with epilators.  Yes, I am a weenie.<br /><br />This model of the Braun Silk Epil removes much shorter hair.  It claims to remove hair that is as short as a grain of sand (0.5mm).  I personally find it requires it to be a bit longer than that to grip; but it does do a much better job of reaching short hair than others I've tried.  It has a pivoting head which lets it work around all your body contours.  A light on the unit allows even the palest, finest hairs to be visible.<br /><br />In addition to hair removal, this epilator refines your skin.  A sonic massage system and high-density brush scrub away old skin cells.  This exfoliation helps to stimulate the regeneration of surface skin cells in order to create a smoother skin tone.  I do notice a bit of a smoother, more even skin tone on my legs now.  This sonic massage is my favorite part of the device...in part because I really don't like the tweezing part.<br /><br />This model can be used wet or dry and uses rechargeable batteries rather than a power cord.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I find that it still hurts...although not nearly as much as it used to.  With regular use, the hairs on my legs have become fewer.  Plus, the already pale fine hair is becoming even thinner and weaker.  Braun claims that it will keep your body free of hair for up to 4 weeks.  I usually find it to be somewhere in the 2 to 3 week range for me.  Still, that's nice for when you're going on vacation or heading off to the beach for a week or two.  I allow the growth to get to the slight stubbly stage and then I'm perfectly smooth for a couple of weeks.",[],B00AX3YNPC,B00AX3YNPC,AHO2ZKVTDPL6G35FLZW7UGXCYSEA,1368670340000,3,False

The sponge applicator comes to a small point and I was surprised to be able to do a pseudo wing shape at the outer corner. You do need to use a blending brush to work the fade and I also do a transition color using another brush. I do find it quicker than using  brushes and powder alone, but since you have to re-dip for more powder even when it's brand new, I'm wondering how much effort it's gonna be once the product starts to get used up. You will probably have to not only twist the sponge applicator all the way back into the cap to pick up more, but also tap it to release more powder onto the appllicator. That would be annoying.<br />The color is pretty - a lighter, brighter purple than I expected. Overall, I'd say it's ok. Not great, not awful.

I put them all face up while I was cleaning and when I finished, I picked up the top piece and flipped it so the brushes were upside down.<br /><br />The brushes took a bit of time to dry (12+) but the long time could be because of where I live and the lack of heat/light.<br /><br />Overall, I like this product a lot and will be using it every time I clean my brushes.

I used a bath puff and it did not lather up as foamy as I like. Will try a bath sponge. It does have a very light scent, which is what you expect from a natural product. After rinsing of the body wash, I noticed that my skin was very soft and smooth. They seem to use a very good quality moisturizer in the product that does not  completely disappear after rinsing. The product is not heavy, chemical laden and seems like the perfect body wash for sensitive skin.

That is a lot of heat for hair to withstand.  This blow dry spray protects my hair from all that heat.<br /><br />My process is as follows:<br />I wash and gently towel dry my hair, then spray this on my damp hair.<br />I then blow dry my hair, straightening it as I dry.<br />Then I &#34;lightly&#34; spray this on my hair prior to using my flat iron.<br />I have then protected my hair before the heat of the dryer, and then again before the heat of the flat iron.<br /><br />Argan oil is wonderful helps me prevent the frizzies that accompany curly hair.  It gives it a healthy, smooth shine that I haven't had since my teenage years.<br /><br />The pump itself is very easy to use.

5.0,ADVANCED Moisturizer,"A few years ago, I was trying to decide if I could wear contacts after 30 years of just wearing glasses.  I struggled through many different pairs and brands of contacts and they all just never felt right.  My eyes just felt gritty and dry.  My doctor finally just made this comment, and it is very true:  At a certain age women just have less moisture in their bodies (in this case it was my eyes).<br /><br />That phrase also applies to our skin, and of course the most visible is our face.  This moisturizer is for those of us that need that extra little boost, as we might have &#34;advanced&#34; skin.  Now in my late 40's I am noticing those fine lines, especially on my forehead, what I would call my furrowed brow lines.  Will this moisturizer erase these lines? No.  But it can help diminish appearance.<br /><br />An added benefit of this moisturizer is it also provides a moisture barrier to protect your skin from the elements.  As a child of the 80's, we all grew up loving the sun and getting tan.  Now we know better and with better products are able to protect our skin from the elements.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKG14OEE86CQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0SE52Q",[],B00U3CMZXA,B00U3CMZXA,AEWSXV6I6BVJQFNUV2EXHEWXRQXQ,1447815240000,0,False

It is concealed behind the large rotary heads, even when it is extended it is nearly impossible to use.  It can only be used in odd angles in order to see what you are trimming.  For example, I sometimes trim hair growing over my ears - but not with the Arcitec - you can't trim in that direction.<br /><br />On the plus side - the shaving head is very good and offers a nice close shave.

5.0,WOW,"*EDIT: I continue to be wowed by this wig. I ordered another one in case I messed this one up and then went ahead and straightened this one with a flat iron. I cut the lace, used a wig band and it's not even glued down. Still love it, maybe even more now!*<br /><br />To say I'm pleased would be an understatement. I've been looking for a wig that matches my hair color!! My biggest complaint is that I have a round face so I NEED bangs or fringe or something. A hairline on a non-lacefront makes me look even ROUNDER and that's not the look I'm going for! Most wigs require a lot of trimming and shaping to give me the look I want.<br /><br />I love long hair but not every day. So ... i thought I'd try this baby. Not only is the hairline beautiful but the color is perfect, the weight is amazing and the length is just right ... not too long like many are. I'll cut the lacefront eventually but these pictures are literally how it looks just plopped on my head, with my own hair peeking out. If anything, I might try to give it more volume because i love big hair but ... a few bobby pins, a wide-tooth comb and I'm SET.<br /><br />This wig is beautiful. I've included a picture of my real hair for reference. I've never given a wig such a glowing review but this is literally plug and play and, for me, that makes all the difference!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+7RzYl9fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+7RzYl9fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+7RzYl9fL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MOR6KuDRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MOR6KuDRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MOR6KuDRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hCKoFRWUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hCKoFRWUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hCKoFRWUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nLEUafcLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nLEUafcLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nLEUafcLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q5qdcAPKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q5qdcAPKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71q5qdcAPKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xNzSrYN7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xNzSrYN7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xNzSrYN7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GGBaccd2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GGBaccd2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GGBaccd2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07XRFLQGT,B07XRFLQGT,AFPF3LF4TA2BRMWPCAFENP7V5ZYA,1569890243930,8,False

5.0,"Different, but impressive.","So I’ve been debating purchasing this product for a year. I’ve heard good things about it and bad things. I heard it didn’t really have much of a scent (I love my scented soaps) and that it was hard to lather.  As far as the scent goes, it didn’t matter near as much as I thought it would. Honestly, with most soaps the scent fades rather quickly anyway. And it does have a scent. Just not a perfume scent. It’s very pleasant. And it was super easy to lather. I had absolutely no issues. Truth be told, it lathered better than almost any soap I’ve used.  What it’s not is “foamy”, and that’s actually a good thing. As insane as this may sound, on the face it feels like wool. It has a close, cushioned feel to it. Some soaps I’ve used either dry out on the face before I finish a pass or it slides off my face. Not this. If you prefer natural, perhaps old-fashioned soap this is for you.",[],B06XRZ6Q4Z,B06XRZ6Q4Z,AFAOODWSSWROX7QU6AU2ZWZPKCKQ,1541577776555,3,True
4.0,Great for Smooth Skin,"Cons:<br />I bought these because it would supposedly also help you save on soap by creating loads of lather. I do not notice that effect. In fact, I would say I notice less lather.  I do not use traditional soap, however, and instead use handmaid castile soap. So, instead I just lather up first, and then use this cloth, and it's not a huge deal.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and this cloth can be too abrasive if used with any pressure on some parts of my skin. So, lathering up and then using the cloth also helps me to only use this abrasive cloth where I need it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great for those little bumps.<br /><br />Fantastic at exfoliation for shaving, waxing, any hair removal, etc.<br /><br />Helps with ingrown hairs!

I used it folded on my body, and then unfold it to full length to use on my back (like the picture shows). You have to keep it out of the stream of water, or else the soap will wash right out of it.<br /><br />They were definitely much more harsh than I expected - I can only use them very gently, and can't use them at all on especially thin areas of skin like my shins, the tops of my feet, or my chest. I'd absolutely never use them on my face or neck.<br /><br />After the first use, I noticed an immediate improvement to my bumpy skin.

I mean this is kind of a waste of money. It's really cheap material. Literally the ears are made of one thin wire that shapes it and it's covered in cheap lace.<br />I could already tell right from out of the packaging that these pair of ears were cheap looking. They did not even make any effort of cutting the lace right. One ear has more lace material than the other and it's kind of bulging out. Plus the lace is already falling apart. There were a few pieces of lace that came off already and I literally just opened the packaging like 10 minutes ago.

5.0,Really like this one.,"Yes, these are the full size. I've purchased the pink and clear before and loved them. The pink stays on really well even though I have to wear steel toed shoes at work every day.  Other (high end) brands have failed that test often. The pink color stays solid with that test long enough that my nails start growing out and I have to change out the polish for that reason.  The purple color must have a higher pigment load because it did chip slightly where my toe rubs against the box of my steel toed shoes. But that is still way better than other polishes. It even survives my regular beach trips.<br /><br />The polish has helped with the damage to my toe nails. The cracking I was getting is less. My family has an inherited condition that over the years causes the toe nails to thicken. The older generation has thicken so much that they have to use a rotary tool to trim their nails.  I gave a bottle of the clear to one of the men with the issue and he has seen an improvement as well. I can only hope that with the continued use my nails will never reach the level that theirs have. Since I saw a huge improvement when I started using it, I think there is a good chance.<br /><br />P.S. I am a nail polish junkie.

When you pull off the clear cap (over spray nozzle) the ENTIRE spray nozzle pulls right out of the bottle.  It doesn't stay snug on bottle threads. Horrible bottles. Mine are headed for the trash can.<br />I like these bottles since they are plastic instead of glass.  Perfect for my use.  Size is great.  BUT.... the plastic &quot;hose&quot; inside doesn't even reach the bottom of the bottle.  They are at least 1/4&quot; from the bottom.  It will waste a lot of product in each bottle.  Picture shows the &quot;hose&quot; being so long as it wraps around just a bit.  Definitely reaching the bottom of bottle.  And, in packaging - which they were just thrown in box - a couple of the bottles have arrived with scratches in them.  They don't appear &quot;new&quot; when they arrive this way.  If I were selling something in them, it would be unacceptable to me.<br />UPDATE 2/18/16 These bottles are going from a 3 star to a zero rating, as far as I am concerned.  After I filled these with some e.oil air spray, I found that the nozzles LEAK to no end.  With just one or two sprays, there is fluid running down the nozzle and bottle soaking my hand.

It makes my face look awful during a video call or even at a photo shoot. So I am always on the lookout for something that may help.<br /><br />This Cell Fusion C moisturizing gel is promising. The product came in a tube enclosed in a small box. The box around it is sprinkled with instructions. English instruction at the right side and equivalent Korean at the back. There are no leaflets inside regarding the product. I guess the manufacturer believes the pieces of information provided around the box are more than enough.<br /><br />To use, I uncapped the translucent plastic hinged cap. There is a foil safety seal at the tube’s mouth I need to remove. I love the smell of this. It is flowery with a hint of Philippine Jasmine (Sampaguita) and Perfume Tree (Ilang-Ilang). There is also a teeny-tiny hint of lavender and citrus. It is made in Korea so I guess they use Asian flowers. The fragrance is subtle and not overpowering. It is light and not greasy. My skin did not complain, no irritation, no tingling sensation, and it just felt relaxed. This would be good to use during summer when my face becomes oily, and breakout may occur due to clogged pores.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfHzPYG-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfHzPYG-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QfHzPYG-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YXY5BMmRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YXY5BMmRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YXY5BMmRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bweh1F3PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bweh1F3PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bweh1F3PL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71raGV+6iVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71raGV+6iVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71raGV+6iVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08HQYCP7Y,B08HQYCP7Y,AEXAUTXMJTYXDMM2EFSTHE6ZI2XQ,1676567974156,0,False

My favorite of the two is the gua sha - it really improved the circulation in my face (as far as I could see and feel) and I really do believe it reduced inflammation on my face. My skin is less red and less irritated. It feels really good too. As for the roller, I don’t use it as often, but I do find it helpful. I use it to rub oil onto my face and the cool sensation of the quartz feels good. I’ve been using this with a face oil and my face has been quite hydrated, which is great for the dry winter months.

I've now used it exclusively for over 3 years and purchase it in multi-packs for team events.<br /><br />I've spiked hair as long as 18-24 inches and, if you can find a creative way to sleep with your hair spiked so high, your style will last a few days, even if you're dancing in the wind.<br /><br />Tips for use: Brush or comb hair. Depending on the desired style, it's often helpful to part hair into segments for spikes and using coated hair ties to keep the segments apart.  Apply spray to clean, dry hair.  Spray  Got2b Glued liberally (your hair should feel wet) first to the roots in small segments and dry with a hair dryer on a cool setting to establish the &#34;base&#34; of your style. Use your hands to shape it as your dry. (For some of the longer hair, it can become a  four-hand task, so get some assistance from a friend.) Once your shape is set, spray to the tips of your hair in small segments  and dry each segment before doing the next. When you've spiked all segments, give your entire style one more heavy coating and dry with the dryer.  For liberty spikes or other styles where you want the tips to stay tidy, apply a small amount of Got2b Ultra Glued Invisible Styling Gel (smile.amazon.com/Got2b-Ultra-Invincible-Styling-6-Ounce/dp/B004FQK7DA/) to the tips only and dry once more with the dryer.<br /><br />Clean-up is also easy.

5.0,A superb brace in all regards,"I bought this brace after a fall in which I'd injured my knee, as well as my ankle, and needed to keep my knee completely immobile -- no lateral tuning or twisting at all, and restricted flexing and extension.  It was the third brace I ordered -- the first was not nearly strong enough, and the second sizing was off. I'm so glad I found this one: It's a superb brace -- fine, sturdy stays,plus hinges that let you adjust both flexion and extension. I initially thought that latter feature was something I wouldn't need, but it turns out to have made a huge difference during this first month of healing. (Needless to say, I could not have handled a sleeve-type brace -- the open front/wrap style was mandatory, and made my life so much easier.)  I've been wearing the brace 24/7 -- night as well as day --  for more than a month and it's been my saving grace.  Service has been superb, too: Before I ordered, I measured my thigh, knee and calf; I was on the cusp between sizes, and so ordered up. That seemed like a good idea at the time because it allowed me to wear the brace over my slacks, as well as under -- but after almost a month of continuous wear. the thigh (which was a little larger than I needed to begin with) seemed to have stretched out; I couldn't wrap the upper portion tightly enough and even with the straps cinched tightly, the brace slipped after an hour or two or wear. I wrote the seller and asked if there was a solution -- this brace was costly enough that I didn't want to have to pay out of pocket for a second one -- and they offered to send  me a smaller size. It arrived within a few days, accompanied by a label for free return of the first.  I couldn't have been more impressed or more grateful. I'd recommend this brace, and this seller, to anyone.",[],B013J4E6BW,B013J4E6BW,AEMO6QJJB252J43ZO375C34JPPOA,1471888856000,12,True

4.0,Good for Halloween or cosplay,"I bought the black/green ombre for my Halloween mermaid costume.

The only drawback is that the hair is very shiny, almost oily in appearance, but dry shampoo takes care of that easily. The combs and adjustable straps make the fit secure without being too tight.<br /><br />All in all, I'm quite pleased with the wig and look forward to wearing it this Halloween.",[],B07TMXZW5B,B07TMXZW5B,AETI2T553F55EBQXBVO4EMEXFDHQ,1634829117546,0,True

The pages though do rip a bit easily, you just have to be careful when pulling the plates out and putting them back in. I did have one plate, at first, that was actually stuck in the page. The plates themselves are on a thick plastic card and on the back of the card is the Cisi&Sisi logo in black. Well, that logo was actually stuck to the inside of the page and that's why I couldn't get the plate out. I had to carefully stick my fingers inside to separate the page from the plate. Some of the logo ink stayed on the inside of the page but it didn't happen again.

5.0,Perfect for avoiding messy manicures!,"I do a lot of nail art that includes stamping, sponging and a bunch of other really messy designs. My problem is that when I do all of those things the polish gets all over my skin making clean up take a bit longer than I like. So I needed to find something that could help with that problem. In comes this liquid latex!<br /><br />I ordered one in the hopes that it would help with keeping the skin around my nails clean while I'm doing those messy manicures. I cleaned out an empty nail polish bottle and filled it up with this liquid latex. Then I used the brush from the nail polish bottle to apply the liquid latex to the skin around my nails. I gave it a few minutes to dry then did my manicure. Once done with the manicure I used a little nail polish remover on a brush to make sure none of the latex was attached to the polish on my nail (don't want to ruin the manicure by pulling the polish on my nail off with the latex). Then, using tweezers, I pulled the latex off of each finger. For the most part it came off easily leaving clean up much easier with less to clean.<br /><br />This was a lifesaver! I am very pleased with this liquid latex. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell, it's almost a fishy smell. It is very strong at first when applying. Once dried the smell does dissipate for the most part so it doesn't bother me that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

5.0,Easily organizes those small round plates,"This is a wonderful case for small round plates, I am very glad that I ordered it! Before I had gotten this case I just had been keeping my round plates in a little drawer that I made, so needless to say it wasn't at all organized and when I would close and open the drawer the plates would all shift making an even bigger mess. Now with the plates holder I can have all of them organized and easily viewable. It really does make it so much easier now. Now when I'm getting everything ready to do my nails I can pull out this plate holder and quickly flip through the pages and look to see which plate and design I want to use. So so much easier! I love that it has a zipper enclosure so keep all the plates safe from falling out.<br /><br />I do wish the slots were a tiny bit bigger so they could also fit the small square plates. Also, with my long nails it can sometimes be a little hard to pull the plates out of the slots on the pages. Those would be my only issues with it. I almost filled it up with plates I already have and I love stamping plates so chances are I will end up ordering another one when I've run out of room.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

Overall, a good diffuser, esp for the price, I gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />** One flaw is that it's very hard to get the top off. My hands are fairly small, and due to the coned shape there is no easy way to get a grip on the lid.  The first time trying my hand kept slipping off... I literally couldn't get the top off. I had to use my nails and grab the seam. Eventually I worked the lid off, but once theres water in it, i couldnt do that again because i had to lay it sideways to do this.<br /><br />Now that I've used it several time the lid comes off easier, but in my opinion, there should have been some kind of lip on the back to hold onto.<br /><br />If you have larger hands, you probably wont have a problem.

5.0,"Works great, a little hard to attach","This wonderful product allowed me to continue using my favorite T3 Featherweight blowdryer with my new Xtava Black Orchid diffuser!! I didn't have to buy a new blowdryer! I will admit that I measured the wrong thing when I ordered the SnozzlePro adapter (I measured the base of the concentrator nozzle that came with the blowdryer and not the actual blowdryer nozzle - oops!) My blowdryer is actually a little wider than the measurements given for the SnozzlePro. It was so close, I was determined to make it work! I was able to do it with a little manipulation and a slender tool to give just a little extra stretch to get the SnozzlePro over the end of the blowdryer nozzle (used a tool WITHOUT any sharp edges or points, nothing that could damage the SnozzlePro or the blowdryer). **I did this at my own risk - knowing that I could possibly damage the SnozzlePro or my blowdryer!!** Very gently, I was able to get the SnozzlePro onto my blowdryer. I made sure it was evenly attached all the way around before adding the Xtava Black Orchid diffuser. I attached the diffuser to the SnozzlePro AFTER I put the SnozzlePro on the blowdryer - the opposite of what the instructions advise you to do. (also note that before attaching the SnozzlePro to the blowdryer, I put the diffuser on the SnozzlePro a couple of times to make sure it fit properly and that I would be able to attach it without needing to use the other end of the adapter to make sure it was secure).  After getting everything in place, I'm happy to say that it's very secure and there's nothing that is loose or has any wiggle room whatsoever!! I'm never removing it!! It's there until the dryer kicks the bucket or something breaks! It's working beautifully! It holds very tightly and securely, it hasn't slipped or moved at all since I attached everything!! You can see in the pics how tightly it's holding. I love drying my hair with this diffuser! My hair looks amazing and dries faster than when I used to use a round brush! No more work drying with a round brush! Just using this diffuser and moving it to different sections of my hair, it's easier than ever to dry my hair! Thank you for making this product that allows us to use this wonderful diffuser on other brands of blowdryers! I will be recommending it to everyone who has curly hair!<br /><br />Update - the adapter and diffuser has come off a couple of times and it takes a little bit of work to get it back on because my blow dryer is a tiny bit bigger than the measurements but I can get it back on. I think it came off because I accidentally held it by the adapter or grabbed it by the diffuser. Definitely only hold it by the barrel of the blow dryer (like in my 3rd pic) or the handle for the blow dryer!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9EHluFOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9EHluFOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9EHluFOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nFPnM-JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nFPnM-JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nFPnM-JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WuNTsoNZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WuNTsoNZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WuNTsoNZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07X8Z9W22,B07X8Z9W22,AHHRJIXM7X75XWK4KZUL6AAK3NNQ,1635387169534,5,True
4.0,"Looks great, but not practical","This looks very nice when it's assembled and you use it to store your brushes. A word of caution when you assemble it, attach the rods to the bottom piece first, then when you attach the top piece, make sure that the holes line up before you attach the top screws. They don't all line up on every set of holes. I had to undo it and reattach it to get the top and bottom slots to line up correctly! Once I did, it works beautifully. It would be nice if the bottom holes were a little deeper to hold the bigger brushes better. A little tab to pull the protective plastic would be nice too, I was afraid of scratching it while I was trying to get the protective film off! Overall it's well worth the price and I'm glad I bought it. It holds my brushes and looks very nice. UPDATE: while this looks like a nice brush hokder. It's not very practical for everyday use. The slightest touch will move the brush out of its holder. The bottom holes don't hold the brushes securely. My brushes are constantly falling over and sliding into the holder.

I know that some people are put off by the words ""made in China"" but I've learned that does not automatically mean a poor quality product or an ineffective one.  And while this gel might not be the right one for everybody else, it is working for me and even better than the one it replaced.<br /><br />I thought it reasonably priced.  It was carefully shrink-wrapped to avoid any leakage, bottled in convenient size (box of two), and neither too runny nor too thick in consistency.  Some reviewers mention an odor or aroma of some kind but I detected no such thing.  Initially it seemed a bit wet in application but then was fully absorbed after a few seconds and left no sticky or gummy feeling whatsoever.  This is a dream come true for my skin which seems to have become drier and more sensitive with age.  I have used it frequently over several days and have passed the point where I'd encounter a bad reaction so I'm more confident now that I made the right choice.

It's much easier NOT to knock it to off while using.  The only thing I don't like is that the tip twists, which allows the brushes to easily fall out.  I have a habit of holding tip while using and it twists, so I am either going to have to break this habit, or superglue the tip so it can't move.  Heats up quickly - works very well.

1.0,Nice razor but the head replacement cost is astronomical. I will never get another Norelco and would not recommend any Norelco.,"I bought this razor several years ago. It is no longer made so they have stopped making the replacement heads. The Norelco factory store has replacement heads for sale at $295.00 each!

5.0,Pretty natural looking,"Finally, after over a year of having these, I actually tried them out! I’ve never worn false lashes before and was hesitant to use them (obviously since I’ve had them a year without using them - lol!). I’ve seen so many false eyelashes that are so crazy over-the-top obviously fake looking. These are not that way at all. You get a generous supply of them (see photos) and they are reusable too. With the rate I’m going, mine should last forever!<br />I don’t have get up close vision so it was a little bit harder for me to apply them than it would be for someone who can see better. I used a magnifying makeup mirror though and did fine. The photos of the eyelash after it was applied was my first attempt ever to do this so it’s definitely not perfect but it was much easier to apply than I expected it to be. I am sure my results will improve with practice. These are secured in place with magnetic eyeliner (I guess I am pretty ignorant about these things but I had never heard of that!). The eyeliner goes on smoothly; actually better than some liquid eyeliner that I’ve used in the past. It’s a little tricky to get them in the best spot. Like I said previously though, I think this will get much easier the more times I try them. It comes with tweezers to use but it was almost easier for me to apply them without using them. Once in place, I was amazed at how well they stayed in place!<br />They were easy to remove and the eyeliner did require makeup remover to get it off, but it also came off without a problem.<br />I didn’t wear them long. I will have to get used to how they feel; it wasn’t uncomfortable, just different for me. I have very thin, light-colored eyelashes so I think I’m really going to enjoy these!<br />(Excuse my bad photos too - no other makeup whatsoever on and first attempt so I look pretty awful - lol But I actually love the lashes!)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FGJ93J-JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FGJ93J-JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FGJ93J-JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K1i4GcccL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K1i4GcccL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K1i4GcccL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iWLOiU15L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iWLOiU15L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iWLOiU15L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08Y13HMLC,B08Y13HMLC,AHSRXEAKIZWDKIKTZF2HOG6NF2CQ,1667303432752,0,False

The glue gets gummed up in the lashes and if it dries before you can successfully attach them, they will turn stiff and won’t be able to get them on the form and have to start over.  It was very frustrating. If the forms had an adhesive backing it would have solved the problem. I’m just hoping my lashes won’t fall out after only being able to get one eye done.

I'm hoping to fix my left eye brow (I over plucked it by accident a few years ago and it has never recovered) as well as get thicker lower lashes. My upper lashes are naturally thick but if this helps them grow longer I will be very happy. Been using every day for 1 week now and I think I have seen some new growth but not quite sure. Will update in a few weeks.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yp7+vq+TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yp7+vq+TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yp7+vq+TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1jKKZo3XQS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1jKKZo3XQS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1jKKZo3XQS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07SQ9FXF3,B07SQ9FXF3,AG2CQJBF54XFPS5XN3ZIEKAR6MOA,1612276204523,1,True

It is made of heavy duty nylon type fabric, measures 13.4’ x 8’ x 4.3’ and includes a shoulder strap. The bag can be carried as a shoulder bag, back pack or cross body. It has adjustable compartments that will fit all your makeup. The brush compartment will easily fit at least 20 brushes. There are 3 layers to this bag to keep your different items separated, such as shampoos, brushes, actual makeup. It also comes with an attached name tag like you use on suitcases. I will more than likely order another 1 or 2 of these for presents in the future for the women in my family, they are really great nice!

5.0,I'm a beginner at contouring. This kit was perfect for me.,"I have a very fair skin tone - my foundation range is usually ivory, or light ivory, the lightest choices. I am no makeup guru, but am intrigued with all the contouring I see going on in social media and magazines. I wanted to know more, but needed a tutorial on how to do this for my face. I liked this set because it came with instructions on how to apply correctly for a contour effect.<br /><br />Each palette in this set is made up of a blush like material - there is no foundation or creamy application to it. Each shade is also matte, and does not include any pearly or sheen tint to it.  The directions state to apply your regular foundation FIRST, then use this contour kit, THEN follow up with your regular blush and bronzer.<br /><br />I really loved the brush that was included in the kit. It gave me much better contouring effects than any brush I have used from my makeup set before.  The brush is thick and flat.  Because this is a powder/blush application, this gave me noticeable contouring on my face, without being too dramatic like a foundation contour product might do that requires sponge blending. I was able to blend this powder in as much as I liked, which softened the contour look.  As I get more confident in my application, I won't need to blend it in as much, but will enjoy a little more drama in the application.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great product for someone like me to try out that is just getting started with contouring.

Aside from low quality their are no instructions on 75% of the items and the instructions that are available are in Chinese/rudimentary broken English. Sure you can Google inspiration on how to utilize the pieces but you shouldn't have to. The two square pieces of Velcro are pointless as I can't for the life of me figure out their purpose. I assumed they were for pompadour's when I was ordering but I was mistaken. The so called &#34;braiding&#34; tool is an absolute joke.

5.0,Great upgrade. Affordable and solid.,"I got this from Amazon Warehouse, where it was open box but supposedly unused. I don't know if that was true, but the condition of my item is irrelevant to the review. This is a great light. It replaces both my 24w UV bulb lamp and my 9w LED UV lamp.<br /><br />This thing cures Gelish and RCM so fast, and my manis are lasting so much longer without lifting or chipping. Most of the time now, I get bored or my nails grow too much before the polish even shows a hint of coming off. The LED placement is great, and it cures all 5 fingers at once with no trouble. There is a bit of heat, but it's minimal and I'd be surprised if anyone found it painful. I haven't tried the 99s low heat mode.<br /><br />The sensor feature is nice. I was under the impression that I could set the timer to 30s or 60s once and forget it, but so far it seems like I have to choose a time every time. If not, it goes on until you remove your hand. I haven't gone over 105 seconds, so I'm not sure how long it would go for, but it definitely doesn't have a default shut off of 99s as advertised. My open box didn't include a user manual. I'm hoping to find one online.<br /><br />The white of this model doesn't reflect as much light as those lined in silver. But it still leaks a fair amount of light. I'd definitely advise using glasses or averting your eyes. And make sure to keep kids away, because even the reflected light can be painfully intense.<br /><br />It comes off the base for doing pedicures, and while the magnetic components seem to work well and the pieces fit together nicely, I don't polish my toes so I don't use this without the base.",[],B01L1ZNNTC,B01L1ZNNTC,AHM357JXSXU2QKGGJ2JYQAJ45ZFA,1498803029310,1,True

The grip is not hard on your hands, and it it light and easy to use as well. When you have long hair, that's really important!

Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.<br /><br />If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don't really need more. This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.<br /><br />I got a coupon to try this product out for a huge discount in order to provide feedback and an honest review.

After a week of trying it both on my hair and mydaughters I could tell a big difference. The texture of our hair was softer and even felt lighter. You could even see a shine on our hair after using it. The feeling of our hair especially my daughters was so soft that there was little to no frizz. My daughter is only 7 and wasn't sure if it would be good on her hair but it seems to be actually helping her hair become more healthier and more easy to manage. I would highly recommend to others.

5.0,These are great stamping plates!,"These are great stamping plates. I've owned many plates made by different manufacturers good and bad. These are as good as anything that I have. I've  tried stamping a few of the images and they all are very clear and crisp. I did these quickly on paper. The plates seem to be engraved well. It comes with two different kinds of stampers plus two scrapers. Both of the stampers work excellent.  I would definitely buy these again and others made by Bluezoo.  In fact I will be looking on Amazon for more plates made by them.  If you are new to nail stamping one thing to know is that you must take the protective covering off of each plate, it peels right off.  It takes some practice but once you have the hang of it you will love nail stamping.  I would definitely recommend this set, it would be a good starter set because  it comes with scrapers and stampers.  I would also recommend using thicker nail polish her polish made specially for nail stamping. It seems to be easier to use than trying to use common nail polish which tends to be a little thin and often smears.

I love it!<br />In addition to the many different designs that are in this set, there are also metallic and white tattoos! Metallic tattoos are so cool! It is like jewelry on your skin! And the white tattoos look really cool in the summer time when my skin is tan! They show up really well for white tattoos, even when I'm not super tan, I was surprised! I really like them!<br />We are definitely satisfied with this purchase, we have had a lot of fun! We will be recommending this product to all of our family and friends!<br />I received this product at discount in exchange for my HONEST review. The discount did not affect my review at all!

4.0,Innovative facial hair removal,"This is a nice idea for facial hair removal. I have never used either one of these types of tools in the past. Getting used to the rolling of the spring tool might take some getting used to but then it does remove fine hair from the face, chin and upper lip. This invention is so neat. I wish I had had it a long time ago. The razor tool , I have not used yet. It does seem as if it will work when I do need it.

5.0,Sturdily made and full of room!,"This makeup storage bag is just fantastic!<br /><br />The backpack is very sturdily made and will definitely hold up to heavy use for years to come.<br /><br />The zippers zip and unzip smoothly, and run in both directions, making it quicker and easier to unzip in a hurry and not worry about them getting stuck.<br /><br />The main compartments are roomy, and allow multiple items to be stored inside. I took the boxes out in one photo to show the room available if you need it.<br /><br />On one side you have a smaller zippered comparment which has a thermal lined pocket inside which can hold hot tools such as straighteners and curling irons, and also allows for storage of extra items such as brushes and combs, or miscellaneous items.<br /><br />On the other side there is another zippered compartment which allows for more products, plus has an netted portion which opens to the outside to allow for tissues to be dispensed quickly and easily. There are slots in this pocket also which allow for small tools like scissors, combs , brushes, etc to be stored.<br /><br />the top handle is sturdy and has a nice grip that's easy to hold on to and carry around.<br /><br />I stored my blow dryer and some brushes in the top compartment, straightener in the side compartment, tissues in the other side, and filled all three boxes with makeup products, and then still had plenty of room left.<br /><br />All compartments are extremely easy access, whether holding the backpack with one arm and grabbing something out, or sitting it on a table or chair and unzipping with one hand. I love that the front compartment is velcroed so that once unzipped, it's still easy to close quickly and will keep everything secure until you have time to zip back up.<br /><br />This is fantastic whether you are a makeup artist heading to a show, or just a glamorous girl with lots of products on the go travelling.<br />Even at home this makes for great storage and easy accessibility.<br /><br />FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Product provided for my inspection and review, all thoughts and opinions are my own","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616FOpRmTPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616FOpRmTPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616FOpRmTPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r6Se1nDKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r6Se1nDKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r6Se1nDKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbdVPKwAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbdVPKwAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbdVPKwAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ffh9PCpiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ffh9PCpiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ffh9PCpiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JV0KcwpTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JV0KcwpTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JV0KcwpTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NlMP-p4JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NlMP-p4JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NlMP-p4JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+g9XhUxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+g9XhUxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+g9XhUxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00TRLC8I0,B00TRLC8I0,AEVLTZZIS7RKWREI7TVDEDV2LSFA,1436300269000,7,False
5.0,Loved it!,"This is a really nice spa-like experience for me!<br /><br />I had a similar one but it has only the rough, scrubber side, unlike this one which has both a scrubber side that will scrub off dead skin, as well as a SOFT side that you can polish your skin with after scrubbing. It feels really nice to flip over to the soft, gentle washcloth-like side after using the loofah side on my back.<br />The handles are long and easy to grab onto comfortably, without having to strain and try and twist your body just to clean and get rid of dead skin.<br />I think the soft side makes this much less likely to harden up and become difficult and uncomfortable to use. After several uses, I find it pliable and maneuverable.<br />In my photos, I've added both the scrubber side and the soft side to show the difference.<br />I used some body wash on the soft side to help clean and polish my skin, and have to say it feels incredibly pleasant.<br /><br />*product provided for my opinion and review","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t3GROwqCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t3GROwqCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61t3GROwqCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ASqhQWrjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ASqhQWrjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ASqhQWrjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mu7eM+e+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mu7eM+e+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mu7eM+e+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00YI0XFUU,B00YI0XFUU,AEVLTZZIS7RKWREI7TVDEDV2LSFA,1435031151000,12,False

There is some sparkly black ribbon lace up the sides of the headband to make them look extra fancy.

5.0,ReGrow Those Brows With reBROW,"I have been using reBROW for a few days now and am loving it.  I am beginning to see the beginning of new growth, slowly but surely, of some new brow hair.  As I've gotten older my brows and lashes have thinned considerably.  I have products I use for my lashes, but this one of the only I have seen made specifically for the brows.  It is easy to apply.  It comes in a container that looks like a tube of mascara, but has an attached brush that you &#34;load&#34; with product and then apply to your clean, dry eyebrows.  After the product dries you can add whatever pencil or powder you use to help fill your brows in while you are waiting for them to grow.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for writing an honest review.  I am very happy with reBROW so far, and am anxious to see continued growth as the days and weeks go by.",[],B015TJJYXU,B015TJJYXU,AESQGR7ZHGFS2W4HO2EHEGW3FPYQ,1445531317000,7,False
5.0,Good For All Skin Types,"I received this product a few days ago but wanted to use it more than once before writing my review.  I also wanted to have my daughter try it as well, because we have two different skin types.  I was given the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotional program at a discounted price in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.  I wanted to insure that the review I gave was accurate - I know that money is hard to come by these days and I wanted to be as accurate as possible when describing the product.  It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.  The box holding the tube looked sturdy and professional - it looked like what you would expect from a high quality product.  I product dispenses easily and is easy to apply to the skin.  It goes on smoothly and evenly, doesn't dry out of make your skin feel tight, and doesn't have a strong or unpleasant odor.  My daughter and I tried the mask together - I have very dry skin, along with some fine lines and wrinkles, her skin tends to be oily and she had a few blackheads and larger pores.  We left our masks on for 15 minutes and washed them off with warm water.  The mask was very easy to remove and left our skin feeling very soft and looking radiant.  An additional bonus for me is the fact that mask contains argan, avocado, and jojoba oils.  Those added oils left my skin well nourished and moisturized.  I applied a light moisturizer because it didn't feel like a heavy one was needed.  My daughter was also pleased with the results.  She had concerns that the additional oils may cause her skin to break out or leave it feeling oily.  The mask washed off her face very easily, her skin felt smooth, her blackheads were gone, and her skin looked radiant.  We concluded that this mask is helpful for any skin type and we are planning another mother/daughter spa day soon.  We both liked the product and plan on continuing to use it.  I can recommend it without hesitation.  It's a great product!",[],B0140EEAX4,B0140EEAX4,AESQGR7ZHGFS2W4HO2EHEGW3FPYQ,1441307293000,1,False
5.0,Reduces Appearance of Fine Lines,"I used this today for the first time and I was pleased with how smoothly it went on.  I also liked the pump to dispense the product so you don't have to put your fingers in the jar and contaminate the product.  I thoroughly cleaned my face, patted it dry, and then applied the product as instructed to on the container.  I received a discount on this product in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.  For that reason I feel like I should tell you the cons I found with the product.  The size of the bottle is much smaller than I have anticipated, and I did feel some tingling/slight burning when I applied the product.  The size of the bottle isn't anything I could have been responsible for, but the fact my skin is very dry and sensitive probably accounts for the fact that I felt it might be a little harsh for my face.  I do like this product, though.  I plan on continuing to use it, but only once daily instead of twice.",[],B00YCGF5T4,B00YCGF5T4,AESQGR7ZHGFS2W4HO2EHEGW3FPYQ,1439344512000,1,False

5.0,Amazing product if you have limp hair!,"I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All opinions herein are my own and are not swayed by the company.<br /><br />I was absolutely ecstatic to receive this product in the mail to try! I am always have issues with my hair. One of these issues is that fact that it ALWAYS lays flat. It is the most annoying thing to me to not be able to make my hair do anything other than straighten it.<br />I am so thankful that I have been introduced to this product because I know I have a new favorite hair-styling product. Zotos is cheap! It's only $12.99 on Amazon. If you're interested, you can also check out their other products on their website.<br />Not only do I love the fact that it definitely makes my hair have more volume, but I completely adore the fact that the smell is amazing! This product has no harsh smells that some hairsprays have. It actually smells like you're getting your hair done in a salon with that amazing hair salon smell that I love!<br />This product is extremely unique because it has a blend of clay and silica. This enables the spray to feel dry as it goes on as well as help build texture that lasts for a whole night of partying, (or whatever you enjoy doing). It's also color safe which is an absolute huge bonus for me!<br />This is a super easy product to use as well. You don't have to have a special type of brush to use it to style your hair. All you do is open the cap, shake the product, spray onto dry hair. I like to blow dry my hair after I put it on because the heat helps me when I'm styling.<br />If you actually want to style your hair rather than just put it on and go, just do whatever hairstyle you want, spray the product, and voila! Amazing hair results in a short amount of time.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716M4weIFwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716M4weIFwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716M4weIFwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AU0CD9A,B01AU0CD9A,AHUZ6YLYUI7GNRHCNSVXOMTCHZAQ,1456636118000,6,False

As great, I assume, as any powder (how different can they REALLY be?), so the details are especially important - like how this set comes with a ton of sponge brushes and those plastic, nail-shaped testers.

3.0,It’s really really adorable in my hair however…,"[[VIDEOID:f7a496b8573ef75cce856e43697157ad]] What I do like:<br />1. The color is vibrant.<br />2. It’s very cute and does give the oversized look when wearing it.<br /><br />What I don’t like and why I didn’t give 5 stars:<br />1. It gets “runs” easily. You can see from my picture there’s several “runs” like would happen to a set of tights. When you’re wearing it however they’re not obvious at all.<br />2. This might be a no brainer because of the size but this is not really a wrist scrunchie, it’s so large wrist wear isn’t practical. You’ll need to either commit to wearing this all day or have some bag or purse to keep it in, this is slightly less practical for daily use then I personally like.<br />3. It’s not tight enough to be used alone, you’ll need to first use a regular hair tie and then add this for decoration, I prefer scrunchies alone because hair ties hurt after a while but this scrunchie is too slick to stay by itself and would need to be folded over several times eliminating that cute chunky oversized look that this is supposed to give.<br /><br />Although I’m a little let down by the practical use potential of the product, I do like this and will definitely continue to use it for special occasions just not daily wear.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615tlA-YfOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615tlA-YfOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615tlA-YfOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813WjVQk3+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813WjVQk3+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813WjVQk3+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09GGH7NWL,B09GGC6696,AH5EMVNFGZ4E37DJWAQ7PGOEK7BA,1654791108503,1,False

I found things I liked and disliked about them.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />1. The kit comes in a pack of 10 and the color variety is good. This is a lot of polishes for the price.<br />2. The colors look the same wet and dry *see video* as well as on the bottle swatch.<br />3. They have lasted very well for me and I work with my hands a lot as well as play guitar often with no pick. This will chip your nails quickly, but this hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />What I disliked:<br />1. This kit does not come with a base or top coat.<br />2. I already have a few base and top coats hanging around the house and the first attempt I made using this polish I used a base and top coat that was not comparable. It would not dry even when under the UV light for quite some time. The second attempt I switched my base and top coat to another brand and it worked. They should really just include the base and top coats if this is a potential for customers. Just keep this in mind if you find the polish isn't drying the first attempt.<br /><br />Given the pros and cons as long as you can find a compatible base and top coat you'll really like this product, if you want to avoid the frustration I'd suggest finding a kit that includes the base and top coats already.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xEg+mMSOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xEg+mMSOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xEg+mMSOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09N8WV99X,B09N8WV99X,AH5EMVNFGZ4E37DJWAQ7PGOEK7BA,1648846675386,0,False

5.0,Soooooo Much Better Than The Budget Option!,"I tried a more budget friendly at home laser hair removal device a while ago and was less than thrilled with the results, but decided to give it one more try with a better device. I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic!

5.0,Downright Impressive!,"I'm super impressed with this fragrance, especially for the insanely reasonable price! I've tried perfumes that cost $150 more than this that I didn't like half as much. The first notes are sweet and bold and then the scent settles down into a nice, deep, sexy fragrance with a bit of a vanilla smell to it, which I absolutely love! My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain. I thought about just throwing it away, but then if I travel with the bottle I'm afraid it will spray all over my bag. Other than that, I'm a huge fan of this scent and would order this again in a heartbeat. I can't believe that a fragrance that smells this good, in a bottle and package that looks this great is so reasonably priced.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gZCqggXSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gZCqggXSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gZCqggXSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08ZSR9HLF,B0BTJ6SYKB,AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,1623097992889,1,False
4.0,My 3 Year Old Approves!,"This is a nice set of glittery nail polish. I personally wouldn't wear this on it's own since it's quite sheer, but it's perfect for putting over a color. I ordered this set because my 3 year old LOVES all things sparkly, so it's perfect for kicking solid colors up a notch and making them fabulous enough for a preschooler. It took two coats to get enough sparkles for her taste. It's kind of tricky to get them even, which for makes my inner perfectionist feel a little crazy, but she's 3 and doesn't care. The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color. There are color dots included if you'd like to make your own color dot for each bottle, but I would much prefer that it arrive with the color on the bottle already so I don't have to. I don't understand why you wouldn't include the color on the bottle. Other than that I'm happy with these.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812pIiX+xuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812pIiX+xuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812pIiX+xuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TGW8oyPoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TGW8oyPoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TGW8oyPoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08CVCLVS2,B08CVCLVS2,AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,1610076149744,0,False
5.0,Only Works WIth Liquid Soap and Hand Sanitizers,"My 3 year old has a knack for making a huge mess out of our old soap dispenser. Tipping it over and spilling the soap, leaving globs of it all over the place, it was just pain messy. This dispenser is perfect for her, and everyone really! I was initially pretty frustrated the first time I tried to fill it with regular, thick gel hand soap because it wouldn't work. Then I went back and actually read the directions and found that this only dispenses LIQUID soap and hand sanitizer. It will not work with gels. If you want to use gel hand soap in it you will have to water it down until it's liquid. This dispenser is a sprayer, so it doesn't turn the soap into foam, and it doesn't work with gel soaps or sanitizers. If you're ok with only using liquid products then it works as advertised.",[],B089YGZZYP,B089YGZZYP,AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,1601000663074,0,False

5.0,Where Has This Stuff Been All My Life???,"Oh. My. Word. *Excuse me while I go throw away all my regular nail polish.* This is a Game. Changer. I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a ""Gel-y"" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the ""300 hours"" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once. This light is great for storing and being portable, but I personally wanted something bigger. Overall a fantastic set. I'm never going back to regular polish ever again!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPx5uwZCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPx5uwZCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hPx5uwZCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B078XKTZHV,B0BC273JJR,AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,1597209932743,0,False

4.0,"Smells great, very intense scrub","When you open the lid of this lava scrub, you'll think you just stepped off the plane landing in Hawaii. It smells so tropical, so dewy, and so tasty I almost tried it. And it's no wonder, with ingredients of coconut oil, papaya extract, and macadamia oil.<br />I tried it a few times on my face (mixed with soap, of course), and it was a little too strong for me. The sugar crystals are large and sturdy, requiring a vigorous scrub to dissolve. It didn't cause me to break out, but I did notice that the rest of the day and the following day, it looked like half my skin got taken off. Dips, discolorations, and small zits that were hiding beneath the surface were all visible - but after a couple of days everything went back to normal. Those of you who have tried chemical or acid peels on your face know what I mean.<br />I get it, if there are that many impurities on my skin, it's a good idea to scrub them away. But I don't really like looking at my face like that in the mirror. So... now I've switched it to a body scrub and use it in the tub. Perfect!

I don't use foundation makeup, so I only used it to wipe off eye makeup, but I didn't get any breakouts near my eye area or forehead.<br />There is an odd smell to these wipes, but if you chalk it up to the 'healthy' aspect (we all know health food stores smell weird) it shouldn't bother you. It's not long lasting, so you won't smell it as you drift off to sleep. These are easy to glide over your face, and with lots of acreage per wipe if you do wear foundation.

3.0,"Very small salt crystals, but smells good!","The best way to describe the scent of this exfoliating scrub is to say it smells like you just walked into a day spa. It's a truly lovely smell, light, fresh, salty, and luxurious. I've actually tried using it as a lotion instead because the fragrance is so nice, but it didn't really work out. It's very creamy, though, and when you put a dollop in your hand, it might seem like there aren't any salt crystals in it, because the cream is thick like lotion.<br />There was quite a bit of settling in the packaging when I opened the jar, and since I ended up using quite a bit in the shower, I don't think it'll last very long--perhaps a month. The salt crystals are very small, and when I tried to vigorously scrub, it washed away before I could properly exfoliate.<br />How I recommend using it, in order to get the best use out of the Himalayan salt is to wet your leg before you step unto the shower, so it's a little more than damp. Then take a dollop and scrub your leg, and when you're done with whatever appendages you wanted to exfoliate, hop in the shower and rinse it off. Somehow, when my legs and arms were really drenched, the scrub just slid right off. Less moisture helped it adhere better. The smell really is great and refreshing, and once I've figured out how to use it, I've started enjoying it more.",[],B076DGMQTM,B076DGMQTM,AFMYD2O2LVQ5HWBCF54SM445F6MA,1571093043073,3,False

4.0,"Flower very nice, but birdcage veil difficult to handle","I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a ""fascinator"" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.",[],B007YV2R40,B007YV2R40,AELVV6ZH6OOR4T4RHJLW377QR7GA,1363332004000,2,True

My eyebrows are, like my natural hair, about a level 4 or 5 dark brown, and the grey brown is probably the closest, though the other colors are handy for changes of color to hair and makeup. My brows are thinning, but a little filling in does the trick, and these pens are my favorite tool for the job, as they both color in where you need solid filling and can be used to make feathery strokes for a more natural brow look. This pen came with a useless little razor and three eyebrow ""templates,"" only one of which I might consider useful (if you are new to shaping your brows).<br />The problem:<br />In the past I have received (I see now from other sellers) at least two or three pens for $6.99 to $8.99. I can't believe I paid over $8 for just one pen from this seller ""Generies."" Going back over the seller page, I see that indeed, by the pictures it appears that one will receive two pens. A sneaky little trick, showing the same photos as the sellers with better deals, but neglecting to include the ""2 CT."" If you are busy or distracted in the least, you might fall for it, as did I--and doubtless, as have many customers.<br />I really dislike writing negative comments, but am doing this to save others the trouble and disappointment of feeling ripped off.

The tip that comes already on the Diamond Microdermabrasion is the normal one, then there is one for sensitive skin, and the last one is a precision tip. When you use this it gently uses suction and the the diamond tips to pull away the dead skin, black heads and even small whiteheads. Afterwards lightly wash your face. It does leave your face a little red but only for a few hours. By the next it was gone. I did have some areas of slight  bruising from going over the same area to often. It wasn't really bruising it was more like a suction mark on your skin but it was gone by the next day. I have used this several times and I absolutely love it. My skin looks and feels much better.

There are bare spots on the top of the wig where you can see all the way down to the wig cap. I am assuming that is why the top of the wig was done the way it was to cover the those bare spots.

To use hot you need to mist a little water on it (but not soak it) and microwave for 30 seconds. To use cold simply place it in the resealable plastic bag and leave it in the freezer overnight. I'm not sure if it really does anything for migraines or not since I don't get them, but everything else the manufacturer claims seems to be true so likely it has some benefits for that application as well. It's best to store it in the resealable plastic bag to make it last as long as possible since the scent comes from lavender blossoms and flax seeds rather than artificial ingredients that can be &#34;recharged.&#34;",[],B00X04M31C,B00X04M31C,AFFBUHYE6RQ66DBGO3KNWVY36PXA,1444264708000,0,False

4.0,Worth the purchase!,"I have a toddler, I need a no-slip option for the tub. I searched, for a good option that was also cost effective. I didn't want a mat - to me, they are too thick and get grimmey/slimey around the suction cups. This was a fun print that is also a good alternative. I had to buy 2 packs (I bought 1 turtle and 1 penguin pack) so there would be enough to fit my standard sized tub.<br /><br />Pros: The colors are vibrant and don't quickly fade (I am writing this review almost 2 months after purchase/install... 2-3 showers are taken daily in the tub where these are located). These stuck easily and have adhered nicely - they have not moved or lifted (i put these in when the tub was clean and dry). My toddler likes that there are animals in the tub. The no-slip surface isn't too rough and it does prevent slips!<br /><br />Cons: I just wish there were more in a package - I had to buy 2 packs which wasn't the worst thing because I was able to get a 2nd print.

3.0,Needs Some Work to Make it work!,"This was my first experience with a wig that wasn’t from Spirit Halloween and I can’t say it was much better. After trying this wig I decided to learn a little more about wigs and I found a ton of info out there about them and how to do a little work on the less expensive ones to make them look better. (ie: thinning them out, plucking the part and hairline, etc.) I also learned about the features of a wig that make it look more realistic, such as synthetic vs human hair/human hair blend, pre-plucked and lace front. Now that I know a bit about wigs I feel more optimistic that I’ll be able to find ones that are affordable yet look more realistic and/or that I’ll be able to work on them a bit to make them look more so. In summary: The part and thickness on this wig are what I think need the most work. There’s virtually no part and the hair on the top is much too dense and puffy. This could be rectified by plucking but the wig is just not worth the work, IMO. The style of it is cute—The length and the waviness of it were exactly what I was looking for. I can’t say the same about the bangs but that’s the part of the wig that would benefit from some plucking and thinning out. The softness is pretty good for a synthetic wig.  I can’t comment on tangling because I didn’t keep the wig long enough to see how it holds up. The color is hard to comment on because it looks so different depending on the light—It can look like an ashy light brown with subtle highlights, a darker, less ashy light brown with no dimension to it, and in others it appears to have a mauve-like tinge to it. (You can see the differences in the pics.) In the end I returned this wig and after doing more research I decided I wouldn’t buy another inexpensive synthetic hair wig and instead look for a human hair blend that may be a little more expensive but looks more realistic. The bottom line: I recommend not buying this wig unless you know how to work on a wig to make it look more realistic.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7153++IOF1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7153++IOF1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7153++IOF1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f1kzpGsnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f1kzpGsnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f1kzpGsnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZtmLoX2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZtmLoX2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZtmLoX2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81atPP1YtZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81atPP1YtZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81atPP1YtZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B083FMJWT9,B083FMJWT9,AFQZ6QZ3TW4JW4ZK57BA62AGY2QQ,1640580587773,4,True

4.0,Nice Hair...,[[VIDEOID:6a57170ccc8c26b9919f6916889d48da]] This hair is very soft and feels good going through my fingers. The quality is great but it sheds...quite a bit. My video shows the hair shedding a little wad just from one bundle. They are a little thin and the weft that is holding the hair in place have a good bit of stubble. The hair itself is great other than that part. The deep wave is defined and there is no odd smell from the hair. They are wrapped up pretty nicely to keep them together but there are some loose strands sticking up from the wrapped weft. Nice hair if you don't mind the shedding/stubble and affordable.<br /><br />I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

5.0,Big Bar Of Soap!,"I have been using this soap for the last 5 days and wanted to use it that long to see if it works for me. I have sensitive skin on my face that is prone to breakouts no matter how much the company says it is for sensitive skin. I have minor adult acne and still hate it. I just want clear skin...is that not too much to ask? Well, after just 5 days, I see a major improvement around my t-zone and chin area that normally breaks out with everything new I try. I did have one bump that showed up and drew a white head but only lasted a day at the most before it dried up. This is my first time ever using an African black soap and always heard good things about it, and so happy I tried it. This is a really BIG bar of soap that I've cut into smaller pieces so that it last longer. I use it on my arms, legs, and face only. So far, doing wonders. I no longer have dried out skin to where I have to immediately put on lotion after showering. Totally worth trying out, even just once!<br /><br />I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

1.0,Didn't work as well as hoped,"This product was okay for minor maintenance of hair loss, but at about the three month mark my hair thinned in gobs across my scalp. Given that yes, I have scalp problems that are not genetic, but other products have worked better. Redken is a brand that works. I have a few issues with this product that are not limited to the failure for it to help my hair problem.<br />Cons:<br />This does not increase volume and thickness, it coats the hair in a waxy substance that makes the hair feel disgusting. If that's volume, it's not worth feeling that way consistently.<br /><br />This product has soy and wheat ingredients in it, both of which have no actual use due to the high content of phytates and lectins binding all nutrient content away. Any claim to nourishing hair is automatically refuted because of the science behind these seeds.<br /><br />The price for an ineffective product is too high.<br /><br />The ingredient list is a bit long, but not filled with artificial chemicals.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The shampoo smells good.<br /><br />Can help with extreme minor maintenance, but is not very good long-term as far as I could tell.<br /><br />Effective against seborrheic dermatitis and general dandruff.<br /><br />Contains beneficial, natural ingredients, but the soy and wheat are unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, this might work for someone, but not me.

5.0,Nice kit for beginners/parent child activity,"I purchased this for my 7 year olds birthday. We got around to doing it tonite, finally. Overall, we were very pleased with this kit. Make sure the water temp and oil temps are spot on, add them and mix. Let sit, mix, let sit, mix, let sit, mix, etc. I was surprised how simple it was. It's nice how they combine oils and make everything into convenient packets of mixtures. Not having to measure really helps you focus on making the actual product while still keeping my daughters attention. She enjoyed this very much and was so eager for us to be able to stop mixing it and bottling it up.<br />My only gripe is the amount of lotion. We wanted to play with scents, so we used flavor oils we found in our cupboards. But, because they are tiny 2 oz jars, it was difficult to experiment with different scents. We did end up just taking out 2 oz of lotion, scenting, bottling, repeat. But, it was kind of annoying. For double the price of this kit, I saw another kit that makes 4x this amount of lotion. But, I believe ingredient wise, this kit is better. I love that this company chooses a natural preservative and that they use essential oils for scent. (It only comes with 1 scent - lavender) To make this kit better, they should increase the amount of lotion this makes and maybe offer a variety of essential oils to make a few different scents. I also wasn't quite clear on if they used unrefined or refined mango butter, but considering the small amount, it's not a huge deal. For the first timer, this is a great intro to DIY AND THE BEST PART: the lotion is lovely!! Makes my hands so soft and isn't greasy.

Dad, mom (me), daughter, baby sibling, and grandma. They go on quickly with a little bit of water and only pressing for ten seconds. They look great once applied with very bright colors and unique designs. Dad's was barely scrubbed off the next day in time for work.

This mascara is the FIRST mascara that I’ve found that truly Elongates my lashes while separating each lash. Because the wand brush has 2 sides to it (a short rubber bristle side and a longer bristle side) I am actually able to get to the BASE of the lashes on my lid and rotate the wand to the longer bristle side to coat each lash while separating them - on the FIRST application!  The result is PERFECT each and every time without the mess, clumping, stickiness, etc that almost EVERY other brush causes.  The other thing I noticed immediately is that since the brush doesn’t taper at the end like most brushes do, I actually get mascara on my inner lashes (near the nose bridge) without making a clumping mess!  My current Triple Play has been finished for a while now and I’ve just been (unhappily) using THIS wand to apply my other mascaras! :-)). I’m so glad Amazon has come through yet again for me!

2.0,Hair just slipped right off the small brush,"Very disappointed.  I was trying to replace my existing hot air styling brush (LUXE Brand) before it breaks.  I quickly realized the LUXE brand has been replaced with another name, that being Jinri.  There are other names for this same style, one of them, Sultra which is SUPER EXPENSIVE ($149.00) for the SAME dryer.  CRAZY<br /><br />The reason this Milanta brand is being returned is because the 1 1/4 brush does not have those little balls on the end of the bristles therefore my hair just slides right off.  If you use your hand to hold the hair in place, of course your hand gets too hot.  The small brush is difficult to hold on the tip, it is slippery, it needs BIGGER Ridges to grip. The Big brush bristles are much better and they DO HAVE the little balls on the end.  BUT the TIP  of the brush does not have a enough space to put your fingers on while you are turning the brush.<br /><br />The picture above shows my old styler brush in the middle and their (Milantia) brushes on either side.<br /><br />Anyway, I found the Jinri on Amazon and ordered that one, it looks exactly like the one I have.  1000W is the same as my old one.

4.0,A lot of good things to say about this mask,"I really enjoyed this and I think a lot of others will too, if you have oily skin and want a mask that will steadily peel off of your face and take all of the dirt from the day with it then you should try this kit. It comes with a step 1,2, and 3 with the mask itself being step 2. First you use step one ""Export Black Heard "" which helps pull the black heads out of your skin and it does a really good job on its own- I acutally bought this set twice for the first step alone! MY bottle tipped over without the lid on (thanks to my awesome toddlers!!) and I almost immeadiately ordered a whole new set. I could see results before even putting the mask on just from the prep. When you put step 2 the mask on your face you want to make sure that you dont make it too thick of a coating because it will take longer to dry (but this one still will unlike a lot of peel off masks that end up being scrub off because they dont ever harden and do what they claim they will. The third step is also a really good one it closes the pores to prevent them from immeadiately accumulating dirt again. The instructions are in a foreign language, but there isnt too much going on here that is too copmlicated to understand.

I've been using a flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the kinky nature.  This has worked great for me instead.  I wash it, dry it, and then just brush.  One word of caution, the nubs are very hot, so you can put your hand over them, also, your hair will be warm for a few seconds after you brush thru it.  I discovered I could use a dry wash cloth or heat resistant glove to assist in keeping  my hair against the warming surface.  As I place the brush under my hair & brush downward, I place my other hand (protected by cloth or glove) over the nubs, thereby holding the hair tight against the surface.  The smoothing effect is great without any burning of the hair like with a straight iron.  We also used it on my mixed race granddaughter whose hair is much thicker and kinkier.

After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.<br /><br />I’ll stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.",[],B00CUF29WU,B00CUF29WU,AEQYJIM75ATNXL642O7F3P4EMHNQ,1390936221000,1,False

1.0,Terrible - Damages hair worse than flat iron,"I was so excited to try this as I don't want to use a curling iron all the time.  I followed the instructions and watched a few videos.  I woke up with terrible hair to the point that I had to wash so I can style it.  No way I could leave the house looking like that.  The curls were loose and uneven, wack waves and broken off ends.  Just terrible.  Here are the things that didn't go as expected:<br />1)  It's not so easy to put them on and takes 5 tries before one is on<br />2) The velcro pulls hair and makes it messy and fizzy<br />3) Very hard to keep the ends secure, so I. had chunks of broken tips on the floor and sink as I took them off<br />4) The waves are not round as you sleep on it and some look bent depending on how you slept, so more of a kink than a curl<br />5) No way 8 rollers can cover the whole head, so you need at least 2 boxes to do it properly<br />6) the front of the hair looked awful, as it turned into my forehead with a kink<br /><br />All and all, it was a waste and I'm returning them.  Watching all the hair that was left in the rollers with the velcro and on the floor from breaking off, I find it damaging.",[],B07FHLW15G,B07FHLW15G,AFRJZNMGM4TPDEPYVGQRFFODHOTQ,1545487463792,6,True

5.0,Wow! This Shaver Rocks!,"After 30 years of shaving with the old shaving gel and razor routine, I entered the 21st century with the Norelco 7885XL and am extremely pleased that I have. The convenience of being able to shave on-the-go and the closeness this Norelco provides are both well worth the investment. Although, I've got to mention that I got a little lucky price-wise because the Norelco 7885XL magically appeared as one of my Amazon ""Gold Box"" promotion items so I jumped at the chance to buy this model at an incredible savings!

5.0,The Goldilocks Of Hairbrushes,"I have very long hair, and I seem to have tangles that are impossible to get rid of. This brush did a pretty good job with some of the worst tangles and I'm very pleased. However some of my hair overtime due to poor hairbrushes became too matted and will just have to be cut out. For me bore brushes have always been too soft. They control frizz, and make my hair shine on the surface but lack any kind of pull so that overtime my hair will get out of control. With most plastic and nylon brushes I am either breaking to much of my hair or causing myself pain while obtaining mixed results.  With that said,  this brush does a very nice job at keeping my hair under control and giving it that beautiful luster. It has just the right amount of rigidity to pull at those tangles, but it also knows when to give so as to keep these locks in gorgeous harmony. So if you like me are seeking a good quality hairbrush, possibly look at this one.  I can't guarantee you will have good results like mine because everyone has different hair, but for the price it's worth a try.",[],B00MFWM1YO,B00MFWM1YO,AHCI3KIY2PTGBQHPCR5HF5R3VO3A,1428696175000,0,True

5.0,so I am satisfied with this cream,"This cream has actually made a slight difference so far. I have been using this for almost two weeks and I'm starting to notice my breasts do feel fuller. They are still the same size but the shape has improved. I am a former bf mom so they are not as perky as they once were. I wouldn't say this is a replacement for surgery or anything though. For me just seeing any improvement is exciting, so I am satisfied with this cream. I wasn't really expecting this to work in the beginning, I began to see a difference around the third day. I used it twice a day.<br /><br />The smell is a little different. It was musky to me. It doesn't smell bad.. but it could be better. The size is probably enough for a few months, I still have tons so a little goes a long way. The consistency is thick and really blendable. A little nickel sized amount is about what I use each time because it spreads easily. It really just feels like lotion on your skin, it isn't sticky or gel like.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this was the fragrance, the scent is not a scent I would normally wear but since it does seem to benefit my breasts it<br />Is a scent I can live with, I just spray perfume over my shirt and it covers it up.<br /><br />Overall I am happy about this cream, even with the change being suttle so far it still has some affect and that's better than nothing for me. I'm hoping I see more improvement with this in the long run and I will continue using it.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Or a well-meaning aunt gives you a spa package with an eye mask that was silky but looked like you had a panty liner on your face. NOW, these are available, in fun colors. The best feature is that they are concave, formed, so that you can bat your eyelashes inside and your REMs will not be suppressed. You can open and close your eyes ad libitum, thus giving you more freedom and less of a claustrophobic feel. These are light, easy to pack, or store, comfortable, SO, comfortable, and they block 99% of the light.

5.0,"Lightweight, non greasy moisture","The best thing about this serum is that it's completely non greasy. It feels like putting thickened water on your face, but instead of evaporating, it stays on your face and continues to moisturize. I have been using it as a lightweight moisturizer after i wash my face with either an AHA or BHA facewash, so that it really sinks in. That said, it is not enough to use it as a standalone moisturizer, probably exactly because it's non greasy and doesn't create a barrier on your face to keep the moisture in. It says on the bottle to follow up with a moisturizer, and I will but I wanted to test it out alone first.<br />I really like the dropper packaging - you can be very exact about how much serum you're using. I have tried it with different amounts. Today I used only 1/3 of a dropper, and I still feel like it was too much product so next time I will try it will 1/4 dropper. It comes shipped with a screw on cap that you can save and use for travel.<br />I have to say that this really does work. My face feels plump and moisturized with no tight feeling on the surface. It's light enough to put even under my eyes and I don't fear that it will cause millia or clogged pores. I don't have a lot of fine lines yet (36), but my skin is prone to flaking and this takes care of that, all day.<br />It has a very light smell - kind of herbal, but light and inoffensive.<br />I should mention that I received this in exchange for a fair and honest review, and that I have tested and reviewed to the best of my ability.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EqM0Di6BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EqM0Di6BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EqM0Di6BL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AS894AU,B01AS894AU,AEZWYTQOJNABTCHXCA3LWEGP62QQ,1469655205000,2,False

The ""musk"" referred to as ""amber musk"" is the most subtle and acceptable of these; it is somewhat ""softer"" than the old, familiar drugstore variety that had its heyday in the '80s. The florals smell cheap; very few fragrances use essence of living flowers and that is necessary to distill a true floral scent. The jasmine has a ""brassy"" top note as does the honeysuckle. No one should do ""vanilla"" anymore; it is a cloying and overwhelming smell (not scent), rather than a complex ""caramel"", and this one is no different. (Acqua di Parma is the only line that includes ""vanilla"" notes in its scents that have class and understatement.)

To make it easy to grab and place your rhinestones, a flat L-shaped tweezer with a pointy end is included.<br />Room for improvement:<br />You need to buy glue, it's not included. #DontForget<br />The cute shapes are not the same for each color...I got only one black star, one green heart, and one beautiful iridescent oblong diamond. Also, the cute shapes are all larger sizes and take up lots of space on my short nails.<br />Lastly, the white pencil is not waxy, and didn't pick up the rhinestones, but I didn't need it.<br />OKAY, STOP SCROLLING...

The thing I like best is, it goes on dark. You can see everywhere you put it while your putting on, this alone should eliminate streaks. It does lighten up soon after and just as the instructions said became a even shade everywhere it wads placed. The same day it was  visible by at least 3 shades where I put lotion and didn't . So  break the bank if your looking for a nice even non orange tan. You will be happy. I would like to side comment that I used the Thermalabs self tanning mitt whenever appling",[],B00GDKBUDM,B00GDKBUDM,AGV3N2XHQGF7UBYYPSCKMKLMFNRA,1460059707000,2,True

5.0,"Very Comfortable, Well Made, Throw In The Washing Machine","These are very nice gloves.  I've been having a reaction to dish detergent lately. I have a cortizone cream I put on once or twice a day and then put a glove on to keep the cream from getting rubbed off or getting near my eyes. I also put a moisturizer on at night before going to bed and then wear a pair of gloves to keep the moisturizer from wearing off. So far they've worked great.<br /><br />The quality of these gloves actually surprised me. They are well made and the material is substantial. These aren't flimzy at all. I have small hands so I got the medium size. There's just enough elasticity to the material to give me a nice snug, comfortable fit. They won't fall off.  It's also easy to handle things with them on.  I haven't washed them yet but I'm sure they'll wash well by hand for at least a few washings.<br /><br />Feb 24 1018: I washed several pairs of the gloves yesterday. I wasn't in the mood to hand wash or baby them so decided to throw them in the washing machine with my dish towels. I dried them in the clothes dryer on medium heat. The gloves came out perfectly. There was no fraying, shrinkage that was noticeable. They came out soft, comfortable, and totally unharmed.  I REALLY like these gloves!!!",[],B06WP8H97P,B06WP8H97P,AFHV3UDP7TXIE4WWSLD7ZY22QKIQ,1518782160741,7,True

In my little gift set, I received four different scented soaps: Sea Breeze, Golden Crown, Green Tea Goddess, and Luscious Lavender. I’m about ready to cry because these smell so good. I’m not even exaggerating. The soaps are naturally colored and I think the colors of each variety accurately reflects the intended scent. The soaps don't over lather by themselves, but I think that's because of being sulfate free. However, I used the Luscious Lavender with a body puff and it lathered just fine.

4.0,"The good, the bad and the ugly...","My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,<br />the good - I finally found a curler that 'fits' my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool's shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...<br />the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain't nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...<br />the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won't take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky.

4.0,"works well, but has a minor design flaw","I have used ionizing brushes for over 30 years—since they were first sold by Sharper Image. The negative ions work very well to flatten the surface of the cuticle of each hair, making the hair less likely to break or split, and also softer.<br /><br />This particular brush works well, but the one I received has a minor design flaw: the brush part pops off so easily that I have to hold it tight with my thumb, making it less ergonomic than it might be... not an issue for me. As for the vibrating part, I couldn't tell, but that's not what I bought it for. This brush generates NO heat, which is exactly what I wanted. Unlike some similar products, there are NO seams that could catch the hair.<br /><br />TIPS FOR ALL IONIZING BRUSHES:<br />(1) if they don't need electricity (cord or batteries), they're not the real deal<br />(2) heating elements, just like heated blow-drying, tend to dry out your hair and make it more brittle: even oily hair can get dried out<br />(3) brush your hair SLOWLY to get the best result<br />(4) if your hair is flatter after using it, and you don't like that, bend over and brush it upside down to get more volume",[],B07F7TLHXL,B07F7TLHXL,AES3XYFZKSG2HLUJ7EAW63X4AORQ,1538685663458,57,True

5.0,Great palette.,"I ordered this palette in the 15 shade option. I wasn't expecting much from this makeup palette but I was wrong. Now granted, I cannot use most of the colors as I am super fair-skinned but I am able to use most of the left side of the palette.<br /><br />First, I have terrible dark circles. They are sort of a reddish-brown color. The yellow in this palette conceals them better than any skin-toned concealer I have ever tried. It not only covers but also brightens the area too. I also have a brownish spot on my cheek that bothers me every time I look in the mirror. I have tried everything to cover it. I went to a department store makeup counter hoping they could cover it. The makeup counter girl tried for what seemed like an eternity to no avail. She called her manager over to assess my situation. The manager tried to cover it as well, packing more and more concealer and powder but she also could not cover it. She finally said that it was texture and you cannot cover texture. It sounded like a copout to me. It has no texture, it is just a spot. When I apply the yellow in this kit is does wonders for the spot. It is barely noticeable, almost not at all which is better results than I have gotten in the past.<br /><br />I use the green to cover redness that I have around my cheeks and nose area. I just make sure to blend really well and then put foundation over it to get rid of the green. The purple is used to brighten your complexion. Just like with the green, I blend it well and cover with foundation.<br /><br />The best color that matches my skin tone for concealing is the color directly to the right of the purple. For reference I wear MAC Matchmaster SPF 15 Foundation 1.0. Nine times out of ten I am the lightest shade in any foundation. This color matches and is great at concealing.<br /><br />The darker shades are good for contouring but I prefer to use powder contour rather than cream, just a personal preference.<br /><br />Overall I really like this kit. It does a great job of concealing areas that are a constant bother to me. I am including photos of before and afters of my dark circles and the dark spot on my cheek. Hopefully they come out well and you can see the difference.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

5.0,Adds hydration and tames flyaways.,"This Argan Oil hair serum is amazing.  It helps calm my frizzies and provides the hydration my straw-like hair is craving this time of year.  It comes in a 1.69 fl oz bottle with a pump dispenser.  This hair serum smells like lilacs to me.  It is a very lovely scent.  It has a medium consistency to it, not to thick but also not runny.  I have long, fine hair so I start with one pump on my fingers, rub it all over my palms, and apply it to my parched ends.  When there is hardly any left on my hands I smooth the top of my head to tame flyaways.  This serum also gives my hair shine which is another great benefit.  I love this product and I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out.  I think that will be a long time though because I can easily see this bottle lasting me at least a year.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

5.0,This is my second Straightener Brush ever,"However, as far as products go... I really love everything about the way this company presents itself, it's design, it's product and how well the product performs. It has a great warranty (my last one from a different company died in less than 5 months with no recourse), and it came with a bunch of great stuff, including this weird little paddle (the green & white thing) I couldn't figure out at first was a cleaning utensil, and now I really love. It helps you pull the hair from the brush.<br /><br />At almost 30 years old this year, I had spent most of my life hating my hair with a passion. I would wear hats, I would wear wigs, I could not figure out anything that could make me happy... and it's because I was completely inept with styling tools and doing anything that wasn't simple.  So I was beyond happy when someone recommended a straightening brush to me in the first place. Then I stumbled upon the best heat protection spray/frizz stuff ever... and I don't know what happened, for the first time in my life, I'm confident with my hair. So if you're on the fence about getting one of these, because you really have tried ""everything"" and you still hate your hair....I don't know, maybe try a straightener brush. All you do is brush your hair with it....and it changes things a lot.<br /><br />This brush though. I can not have enough good things to say about it. It came with everything! A heat protection glove (especially great if you have thick hair like me and need to go all the way up to 450 degrees!), the cleaning tool, a silicone bag to protect it, OH and the cord swivels. I absolutely love the shape and curve of the actual brush, and the sturdiness of the design. I can't see this thing actually needing replacing any time soon, honestly... and that makes me happy because I'm tired of buying stuff on Amazon and having it fail on me.<br /><br />Of all the purchases in the past 2 years on here I've made, this is easily one of, if not the best.... and I wanted to share the pictures of what it does to my hair, so you can see. That is what my hair looks like after being blow dried, and then straightened with this brush, which doesn't take long at all. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes, and my hair is super thick.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eO2rL1ojL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eO2rL1ojL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eO2rL1ojL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPQ86wpjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPQ86wpjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QPQ86wpjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W582wWm5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W582wWm5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W582wWm5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZFsQWyxVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZFsQWyxVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZFsQWyxVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bHaWjVbaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bHaWjVbaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bHaWjVbaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e8S7a1nWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e8S7a1nWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e8S7a1nWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iTDFNbKsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iTDFNbKsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iTDFNbKsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nAweRSxOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nAweRSxOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nAweRSxOL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qg8zL0xFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qg8zL0xFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qg8zL0xFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07S5GYK14,B07S5GYK14,AGJPSEO2GNAIF5DEFKGJG7XVI6QQ,1569627033413,30,True

3.0,It's not what I thought it would be,"I gave this 3 stars for ""Softness"" because the brush is average to a bit firmer than what would be ideal and comfortable to use on your back, while the loofah strap is average.  The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the ""good exfoliating"" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the ""ouch, that's scratching me"" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for ""Easy to use"" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.  It doesn't seem like a cheap product that's going to warp and break easily if you keep it away from hanging to be soaked when it's not needed for use.  Putting it somewhere nearby where it stays dry is best.",[],B07C6CJMN2,B07C6CJMN2,AG5NZMWXNYH7COAU2FDBLQSVKLEQ,1566100399132,0,True

So I had a vinyl one that lasted longer, but was really just that same old design that was just plastic tied to your head with elastic...<br /><br />This shower cap is... well, frankly, after the other ones I've used... luxurious. The material is not plastic, but more like the soft nylon on my windbreaker jacket. It's much quieter when I'm in the shower, which makes for a more peaceful bathing experience. It is also more comfortable, as the headband is more fitted. It's especially comfortable if you wear it over your ears... there's no pressure anywhere, but it still keeps your hair dry. I, personally, like to have my ears ""out,"" so there is some pressure to the top of my ears where the headband sits, but I don't mind it.<br /><br />The headband does stretch a bit for head size, but not as much as you might be used to if you've used shower caps with elastic bands. I kind of liked this... It makes it easier to get all my hair in it. I flip my head upside down over the shower cap, and the cap just kind of catches my hair like a bucket, and I can just tuck in any stragglers before flipping my head back up. If you need to tighten the headband just a little bit, you can re-tie the bow for a slight adjustment.<br /><br />No shower cap is going to be completely, perfectly water tight. You're always going to get a little bit of water around the edges unless you're really careful in the shower and take pains to avoid direct spray.

5.0,Works!  Looks great!  Eyebrows! Yay!,"So, after being chemo eyebrow bald (and everywhere else bald too) for almost a year due to breast cancer chemotherapy treatments, when my eye brows finally grew back they were mostly white instead of my natural dark brown.  Augh!!  Since I am a second time breast cancer warrior with bigger fish to fry — I ignored my mostly white eye brows for about nine months — hoping they would eventually recover their natural dark brown color after my body recovered from all the chemo poison. Nope. Not happening.  No such luck.<br /><br />The mostly white eyebrows bothered me even more than the flat chest double mastectomy— because well a flat chest can be padded but having invisible brows left me feeling washed out and old.  So, I decided to fix my brows because that seemed like a doable relatively easy DIY thing.  I read lots of  articles on home dying eye brows. Then, based on article recommendations, I found this Godfey product on Amazon and after much research and watching DIY “dye your eyebrows at home” videos, I gave it a go and dyed my eyebrows at home exactly one week ago.  The results:  Yay!!!!  As everyone suggested, I put vaseline around my eyebrows to protect my skin.  I did one eyebrow at a time rather than both at once.  Also, due to my super sensitive skin, I only left the dye on for two minutes per brow.  Still, it worked perfectly.  My eyebrow hairs are still dark brown — one week after I dyed them.

5.0,"Works as promised but the ""no mess socks"" are too small.","I purchased this for my daughter, who had thick, cracked caluses on her heels. She used it and for the first couple days she didn't think it had worked much. Then, last night after her shower, she called me into the bathroom to show me the skin that was literally sloughing off her heels!  Kind of gross actually, but her feet are looking so much nicer now!  The only issue she had is that the plastic &#34;no mess socks&#34; that come with the kit were too small for her size 10 feet.

5.0,"Smooth fast shave, easy to use.","I have used Norelco travel razors for years, about one per year. My recent attempt to reorder was met with double the price, for the same razor.

Shaves very close, doesn't pull,  easy to clean, and i love the battery status indicator. As I said I've used it 3 days, the battery has used very little charge. I'm anticipating being able to go aweek or two between charges. I'm happy with this one, at least so far.<br /><br />OK, one whole week. I've used this razor each day for 7 days....still think it's great. It's easy to clean, quiet (enough), comfortable to hold and use. I'm getting a close smooth shave, and have only used about half the charge. The charge was a concern, because I wanted to be able to travel for at least a week before having to worry about charging.

I have always used clippers to trim down the initial facial hair, and then come in with either a manual razor, or and electric razor to finish the job to get a super close shave. I don't know if it because my facial hair is so thick, but it required multiple passes on areas like the chin, or the necks and still did not get really close to the skin!!!

5.0,Clever and Simple Design Idea,"I don't know if this listing will last because it is (at the time of my order and review) a four pack for the price of a pair elsewhere. But you do indeed get four. So I thought I'd throw a review up.<br /><br />I really like the design behind these. You can mount them with screws on a flat surface or corner. And with the included double sided sticky 3M pads, you can do the same without making holes. Plus probably get them on a round pole like a leg of a piece of furniture. The plastic spikes are a good balance of stiff and flexible, though between the two descriptors I'd lean towards stiff. I mounted a couple on my big cat tree (one on a corner and one on the base flat). They obviously blend in fine there. But they're small enough that they would be discrete even if they were put somewhere more out in the open.  My cat likes them well enough. She isn't as enamored with them as I had hoped but I've caught her getting the side of her mouth on them more than once already.<br /><br />Between the cheap price and the non damaging sticky pad option, they're worth trying out if you think your cat would like them.

I've been taking extra time and good care of my hair these past couple of years since I turned 60, and that is why I can say my hair is moderately thick.

I brush my hair at least 50 strokes nightly and in the morning at least 25 strokes with boar's hair brush.  The shampoo, conditioner and brushing definitely improved the condition of my hair.  But this Brush with its Pure Wild Boar Bristle and Massage Tip Bristle Combination feels very nice on my scalp.  I personally prefer the round handle and the round shape of the head.

4.0,Beautiful Oil For A Splurge- But Not Worth The Hype,"This is a beautiful oil to treat yourself, but the bottle is misleading. If you look carefully, you can see that the liquid does not reach the bottom, that there is another glass bottom a ways up, making the bottle appear more full than it is. I took a star off for that because that's just not cool. They could make it in a smaller bottle & people would still pay $48 for it. It's a nice product. I wish, however, that it didn't have the olive oil in it, because that's what I think is causing acne in a lot of girls skin. For those with acne or if you just don't want to pay this much, you can get the same ""velvet"" results with rosehip oil. The Ordinary has one for 10 bucks. Rosehip oil can help reduce your inflammatory acne, get rid of acne scars, and clear your skin. Rosehip oil is an anti-inflammatory, able to reduce swelling and fluid buildup. Rosehip oil has a low rating of 1-2 on the comedogenic scale (a.k.a. not likely to clog dem pores). Plus, the linoleic fatty acids in rosehip oil have been shown to reduce oil production in oily skin types which can help prevent future acne. I received this Velvet Skin Drink as a sample & like others, I was impressed, but I found it for brand new & sealed for $24 on Mercari. Personally, because of the olive oil filler and the bottle deception, I wasn't willing to pay $48. They do some great marketing, evidently, as it's out of stock all the time. They make it sound like it's made of purely grapes, which it's not & the bottle deception just isn't worth the hype. Yes, the product is beautiful & makes your skin very soft, but is it softer than my Ordinary Rosehip oil? Nah. This is something nice to splurge on if I find a good deal, because of the of Sarantoni grapes, Resveratrol and lactic acid. But there are no studies on the benefits of these grapes over other grapes & they don't say how much Resvertal and lactic acid they use. I wouldn't consider this an active of any of those products.

I love the idea behind the design and I've wondered many times why toothbrushes weren't made in a shape like this.  Then I found these, and I thought, ""finally!"".  But, as cool as they are, it's hard to maneuver in your mouth. The end tip is wide, to accommodate the wrap around bristles, and when I brush (and other family members) the large end tip hits into your back gums when you try to get the back teeth.  Maybe with more use I will be able to handle it better.  But I don't know if that's even possible with the end tip the way it is.  Of note: in the center of the two brush sides is another little brush, for the tops of teeth.  I don't know if it's sufficient in size to get the entire tops of the teeth.  I move the toothbrush around to scrub everywhere well.

The second problem I have with these is the price.  Amazon is usually pretty dang good with offering the best prices around.  I paid just over $19 for the 6-pack of these, which I assumed was a reasonable price.  That is until I found them for $1.49 at Walmart and $1.99 at Kroeger.

5.0,Love Derma-nu,"Hyaluronic Acid? I never knew what it was until recently :) sounds like something you use in the brakes on your car. hyaluronic acid (also known as hyaluronan) is a glycosaminoglycan, a type of molecule composed partly of sugars. Hyaluronic acid is actually a natural structural component of skin, and, in fact, is present in connective tissue throughout the human body.<br /><br />The awesome thing about Hydrolic Acid is its ability to retain moisture; it’s considered to have a greater capacity to hold moisture than any other natural or synthetic polymer. In fact, one gram of hyaluronic acid is able to hold up to six liters of water. The hallmarks of youthful skin is its moisture content. A dried up face will age you quicker then anything.<br /><br />Hyaluronic acid can improve your skin’s moisture content and at the same time strengthen skin’s barrier; that is, the outer layers of your skin. A healthy barrier looks and feels softer, smoother, and plumper. This does all of that. Sense menopause I have suffered from dry skin. This has made a big difference in how my face looks and feels.

They smell really nice and have essential oils which make your skin feel fabulous. I'd definitely recommend it for a great gift for friend or family.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

5.0,Zero Scent!,"I got this Nail Polish Remover 100% Natural for a friend who loves nail polish and has a little girl and is always changing colors. She's trying to live a healthy lifestyle so I thought this would make for a nice addition. I love that all the ingredients are natural and it's safe for children. The instructions were easy to follow but not the fastest way to remove polish (especially glitter polish). It's fastest so soak a cotton ball with remover and hold onto the nail.<br /><br />Yes it does take longer than standard nail polish but it's worth it knowing you aren't using chemicals. The best part? ZERO scent. I know for many nail polish remover is an awful smell and can cause headaches so this is a nice alternative for those who are sensitive to scent!<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

5.0,Why pay more?,"This is a really nice powder countour kit. I was perfect for me because I love makeup but wasn't sure I was going to love the whole &#34;contouring craze&#34;. So, I guess you would say it's a beginners kit, countour kits can get really expensive. It has six colors which are all very similar to the popular Anastasia contour kit but half the price. My skin runs fair to medium throughout the year so I can use 4 of the colors and the darker colors I just use for eye-shadow, usually in my crease as a blending color so nothing gets wasted. The banana color is great for brow bone highlighting. I love that the individual colors are magnetized and pop out so if you use a Z palatte (or a cheap dupe here; [[ASIN:B004SMPK6A ArtBin Sew-Lutions Slim Line Magnetic Box-Translucent Raspberry-6905AB]] you can pop whatever colors you use out and put in there instead of taking the whole palatte. It's nice to have the whole thing though because it has a nice big mirror. It also snaps closed so the lid isn't flopping around in your makeup bag and the powders getting gouged which I like a lot. I really have nothing but good things to say about this kit. If you are looking for high end cream makeup this isn't it but the colors blend nicely and look great so you will be the only one who knows you are using a cheaper brand!

5.0,Great value and soooo soft!,"I picked these up based on reviews in a makeup group I belong to. I am always on the hunt for good brushes but can't get over the sticker shock of $50 each at Ulta/Sephora. These honestly feel just as soft as the brushes I've felt there. I'm sure they won't hold up as long as the brand name brushes but I can buy 4 sets of these for the price of one brush there. They seem well put together, there were no loose hairs. They also came with a description of each brush and how to use it. They are well balanced and I LOVE the case they come in. It's really cute and perfect for rolling up when you travel!

They don't smudge if you wait for them to dry and then use a decent top coat.<br />The only thing I dislike, is the flakiness of the stamping polish around the nail bed, when it dries. It can be messy. Which is why a latex protector may help with clean up. But that's no big deal. Once all is said and done, a quick acetone cleanup or even a hand washing can remove the excess...and once I'm more experienced at application, it may get easier to avoid too. I admit I'm fairly new with stamping. And I would absolutely not remove a star for that anyway!<br />It does what is says. It applies great and looks amazing. It picks up beautiful with every stamper I have...about 10 different heads and 7 different styles of stamper. So, I'd say it's a good product.<br />I'd but them again and recommend them to anyone who's into stamping!<br /><br />Update:<br />Using it a few more times has shown that I just needed practice...it's amazing. Stamps beautifully. I'll add pics. The mess that isn't caught my latex skin protection, can easily be washed away after nails are top coated and completely dry, or with acetone and a brush.

5.0,Great product. Pretty color purple. Good price. Great for nail art!!!,"I got this to try as a cheaper alternative for liquid Latex nail protector. It arrived quickly. It IS absolutely a much more cost effective alternative for buying the tiny bottles individually. And this company has lots of color options too.<br /><br />What I did:<br />I received it and immediately painted it around a nail bed to test it's effectiveness. And since, I've compared it's coverage/ease of use/removability to a product that is intended for nail use (a liquid palisade product).<br />Results are:<br />it works EXACTLY the same. No harder or easier to use. So, if someone uses liquid Latex for nail art protection already, this IS absolutely a great alternative!!! Once I knew it would work great, I got out an empty nail polish bottle and used a little mini funnel and poured it in. I also decided to spice it up with glitter, like some of the more popular liquid Latex for nails companies have done...and it works perfectly still, and looks more exciting, and is amazing!<br />Verdict:<br />I will continue to buy this as my nail art protection. The other items (that are intended for nail art) work great for the same thing, but this is a cheaper and much more customizable option... which I like!<br />Keep in mind, you can use any empty polish bottles... just clean them out thoroughly first. The glitter is completely optional...but if you do use it, I recommend ONLY using the cosmetic grade glitters...craft glitters are just too cheap and they bleed and curl and ruin the stuff they get submerged in. And any tiny funnel would help you get it into a different container.<br /><br />I attached photos.<br />The pics include:<br />The actual product. What I used to &#34;make&#34; it easily applicable for nails. What it looks like when immediately applied, once dried (which dries to a darker shade), and how easy it is to remove with no residue!<br /><br />So, I say, this is a great option for nail art enthusiasts like me, and this product would probably also work for other latex uses (like it is shown on the bottle).

I am fair-skinned with dark hair and hazel eyes, and the colors are perfect. I don't always use every color in a palette and I don't always place the colors as directed, but in this case, Stila knows what they are talking about!<br /><br />The large color on the left is your all-over base, and I apply that first. Next, I go to the top right corner and apply this grayish color from crease to browbone. Third, I take the darkest color and place it quite heavily (but narrowly) in the crease and a little in the corner and lash line. Next, I put the highlight (lightest) color just under the brow and also outside the inner corner of the eye. Finally, I put the shimmery gold-like color in the middle across the lid and blend all the colors with a blending brush. I use the darker blush normally, but use the light one as a highlight if I want the added effect. I love that when I am doing my makeup on the run, I only have to grab this one container and my makeup brushes (I have the EcoTools Eye Enhancing Duo Brush set with four tips on two brushes, so even there you don't have to take as much with you).<br /><br />The quality of the product is excellent and it blends well. Other than the darkest brown, the eyeshadow pigments are not super intense, so you can go light or apply more for a deeper intensity.",[],B01DY8KOM8,B01DY8KOM8,AHTU7OIN4WFLFTE6C3TTRPGKHKMA,1482592591000,8,False

3.0,"good soap, disappointing variety","I've loved Primal Elements soap since I was a kid, but it's expensive to try by buying full bars, and they keep raising the price of this sampler, which they used to call a grab bag and charge a bargain price for (since it's the end slabs they can't sell as full bars), and they keep filling them with a grossly disproportionate number of Christmas soaps.<br /><br />I ordered 3 samplers direct from their website when they offered a special in mid October, and 10 out of 23 soaps that came were Christmas-themed, and 2 of those were duplicates (2 each of Rudy and Skyward). Another 2 of the non-Christmas soaps were also duplicates (2 each of Primal IPA and Paw Prints). The Primal IPAs weren't even in different boxes - they were stuck together, right next to each other, in the same box. (If you're going to bill this as a sampler rather than a bargain pack, and as gift-worthy, at least make sure the soaps within a box are distinct!) Though it's early-mid autumn, there was not a single autumn scent.<br /><br />When I've ordered in the past (whether through them, or Amazon, or RockinGifts), there was a similarly disproportionate amount of Christmas soap, except when I ordered in mid-late spring and got floral stuff instead of Christmas. I've never had luck getting autumn or ""oriental"" soaps in these packs no matter when in the year I order.

5.0,Great polish and great deal! Even you get repeats!,"UPDATE 5/3/21: Got my second shipment today. All in tact! And great color selection!<br /><br />This is a really great deal. If it is packaged right. The first time, unfortunately the bottles arrived smashed due to poor packaging. This is not the vendors fault as it was shipped by Amazon. I told them about it and they gave me a full refund. I really wish they would take a little more care when shipping. Hopefully my next round will go better.<br />**UPDATE**  5/3/21: Got my second shipment today. All in tact! And great color selection!<br />This is my guilty pleasure. It is definitely like gambling. But once every month or so I take the chance and roll the dice.  Some times I get colors I do not have and other times I get 4 of the same. But guess what!?! You can mix these colors and get something that you like.  That is what I do. I have mixed some shimmery colors with solids and came out with a beautiful shade that didn't exist before! And for around $1 each it is such a great deal!!! Dollar store price but top salon quality. This polish has been discontinued which is really sad because it is my favorite by far. It goes on smooth, love the wide brush and consistency. It helps my nails grow and keeps them healthy and protected. Also it lasts forever. I mean the polish in the bottle will last forever. Like no expiration date. I have some that I have had for over 10 years and they still glide like they were new.<br /><br />** This is copy of my review from same product but bought different times and vendors***<br /><br />This a great price for 20 polishes. Buying them in the store would be like $6 or $7. I have to admit this is my favorite guilty pleasure.  It is like gambling lol. For around $1 a polish this is such a fun way to try new colors!<br /><br />I absolutely love this polish. I have used it for years. The nice thing about these polishes is that even after years they still perform as well as the new ones. I love how easy it is to apply. If I am in a hurry, one coat is fine. I like to take my time with my nails so I have steps (below).  I like to change my polish every week so chipping isn’t a problem for me. Also I wear gloves when I do dishes or clean to extend the life of my nails.<br />I love that this polish dries fairly quickly if you don’t put it on too thick. I mean, put on a coat while watching TV or on the PC. Careful not to touch anything! But let it dry thoroughly.<br />Then if you need a little more tint slap a little thin layer to make it pop. Also here are couple tips I learned through my years of doing my nails:<br /><br /> 1. Use the SH Complete Care 7in1 or 170 Clear'd for takeoff as a base coat. (I am pretty sure that is why it’s called that... It makes sense to me) I know they say you don’t need one with this polish, but really it is for easier removal. It makes your life so much easier! Especially with darker colors that seem to get in the creases and under your nail that are a pain to remove.<br /><br />2. Use a white polish (121 let’s snow for example) under any color to make that color really pop. You don’t need a really thick coat of white either. Just enough to give a canvas for the bright color to pop.<br /><br />3. This polish is a little thick so mind that when you apply it. Put one streak down the middle of your nail (your first application to each nail) this will be a little thicker then go to each side and touching the outskirts of the middle line to grab some of the excess there to spread to the sides.<br /><br />4. I use Sally Hansen Salon Manicure Top Coat as well to seal the color in if I am not using a Salon Manicure Glitter Overcoat. I think they both help preserve the color.<br /><br /> 4b. I know glitter can be intimidating because it’s such a pain to get off. Don’t let that deter you. If you like the look of glitter go for it! There are polish removers designed for that now. As well as the polish remover in the jar that you put your finger in to remove color. There is one that has little ridges (or brushes) inside the center wall that help strip the glitter. Can’t tell you where or who. But I can say you probably have one in your town.<br /><br />5. For those of you that like a little shiny nail but not necessarily color. I use the 170 Clear’d for takeoff and add some drops of any sheer color (Arm Candy, Sheer Ecstasy, Sweet Talker, Shell We Dance, Pink Slip) it just looks like a natural nail with clear polish only it hides blemishes! And your nails look super awesome! I get compliments all the time about how healthy my nails look when I do that.<br /><br />I hope these tips help. These are things I have learned over the years. I love doing nails and I am glad to share the things I have discovered to save someone else some frustration or time.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hN0g1oNwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hN0g1oNwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hN0g1oNwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Y9m5BLZhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Y9m5BLZhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Y9m5BLZhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tzyA6JO6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tzyA6JO6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tzyA6JO6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00GLOS060,B00GLOS060,AGDW3JPKVRSMUFGMMIUAYKVFGPBA,1619735254181,9,True

It is a heavier oil but I use it in the shower and towel it off.  It is also great as a hot oil treatment for your hair.

5.0,A Wonderful Time Saving Device,"I am SO thankful that this product was created! They took a hair straightener and a brush and combined it into one simple and super easy step! Since I was born with a tremor, the shaking of my hands would cause me to burn myself often whenever I straightened my hair. Thanks to this straightening brush and it's super cool bristle tips, I haven't burned myself once when using it. On days that my hands are extra shaky, I use the gloves that were provided with this brush, so can be extra careful not to burn myself. The design of this brush is beautiful. I can't imagine one could be any better. The rose color is really nice. One feature that I like about the brush that I've never seen on a product of it's type is the fact that you are able to watch it heat up to whatever temperature you prefer. It takes only seconds for it to reach the temperature you set it on. Another pro about this brush is the negatively charged ions. When using a hair tool that emits negatively charged ions, they cause bunches of H2O molecules to break down into small ones, which helps the device to work better and faster. This is SO much better on your hair. It also seals the hair's cuticle which calms frizz and flyaways. The brush comes with a pair of heat resistant gloves, 2 hair clips, a cleaning brush, all in a nice box. I keep the brush and all of the parts stored, conveniently, in the box. I have no regrets about getting this brush. I included  pictures without me wearing any makeup nor did I put ANY hair products on my hair. I ONLY used the brush. I highly recommend it. Please excuse my terrible hair cut. I hope that my review was helpful to you!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZEiUSx+wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZEiUSx+wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZEiUSx+wL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71inJpixnEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71inJpixnEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71inJpixnEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qGoia4OBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qGoia4OBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qGoia4OBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01MR844VG,B01MR844VG,AF4Q4JQYJFVT6KMUMPB2KWNA4HWA,1493224912000,3,False

4.0,I like this heated eye mask,"I like this heated eye mask, for the most part, I especially like that it exists in the first place! I was searching Amazon up and down for a heated eye mask that can be worn like a sleeping eye mask to relax my eye muscles after sitting at a computer all day when I finally came across this one. I don't care for the color or the kitty design, but the purple material is velvety soft which I do like.<br /><br />The mask easily covers my head, though I do have a small head, and the strap fits around the back of my head pretty well. I do choose to wear my hair up at night when I use this heating mask otherwise the strap slides up my straight fine hair slowly if I move my head from side to side. And I somehow never wake up with it on, though I'm thinking that has much more to do with me removing it during the middle of the night vs a product error.<br /><br />The power cord is composed of two pieces, the first has one end with a USB and the other as a round female piece. Connected to the mask on the right side is the other piece of the cord. This piece has a male round piece and connects perfectly to the female piece. I imagine this design is intended to allow the cord connected to the mask to easily be pulled out if the person moves during sleep.<br /><br />I plug the cord right into my USB-hub with my phone charger and it works perfectly well.<br /><br />The controls on this are odd, and you are provided zero instructions. There are two buttons I believe one is a (-) that is indented and the other is a (+) that is raised if my memory serves me right. You have to keep one side pressed down until the unit turns on, then I press the indented button because the numbers go up to 60 on this side. The numbers displaced are bizarre and I have no idea what unit of measurement they are - though degrees Celcius makes the most sense.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this product had was sewn in contours for the nose and eye sockets so it was able to lay more flush with your eyes. This would allow your eyes to feel a more direct heat. Usually, to counterbalance this I place one of my arms over the heating mask to apply weight and increase the intensity of the heat.",[],B016Q6Q77Q,B016Q6Q77Q,AE6STT3G7ZNZLJYLF3NTBMGW7BLQ,1506357202164,0,True

I have recommended this product to family and friends and many of them keep it on hand as well. My son in law is an IT and cannot stand his hands to feel greasy as it hampers his work. His hands were so dry the skin was cracking. I gave him this lotion and it healed his skin plus he never has to worry about his hands being slippery while trying to work.

5.0,"Well made, leak-free bottles for a healthier, greener lifestyle","Since becoming a mom, I've been trying to live a greener, less toxic lifestyle.  I've started cloth diapering & using un-paper towels.  I've switched to natural body & laundry products.  However, for some reason, I had been holding out on switching to chemical free cleaning and fabric/air fresheners. I'm not exactly sure why I was so hesitant. These bottles made making the switch fun and easy!<br /><br />These bottles have both a mist and a stream spray option, as well as an option to turn off the spraying mechanism.  Currently, I have one bottle filled with a 1:1 ratio of water to vinegar for use as glass cleaner.  The mist option works well on my mirrors and shower doors.  The mist option also works very well for both my homemade room/linen spray and my pest repellent spray. (Peppermint essential oil diluted with water and sprayed on the baseboards/around door and windows.)  I use the direct stream option for my tub and tile cleaner.  It works very well for spraying directly onto the grout.<br /><br />At 16oz, the bottles are substantial but are not heavy in hand. The trigger is easy to squeeze, yet not flimsy.  The glass itself is a gorgeous, deep cobalt blue.  I keep my homemade air freshener in one of these bottles on the bathroom counter and have been asked multiple times about where I got it.  They really are just so very pretty.  Too pretty to be hidden under the sink like most other air freshener or cleaning supply bottles.<br /><br />Often times, when you purchase cleaners from the store in inexpensive plastic bottles with these same mechanisms, the spray head tends to leak after a week or two of use. It never fails.  These, however, are sturdy and seem to be much more heavy duty.  I've used these bottles nearly daily and have not had any leaks whatsoever. As beautiful as these bottles are, this is what impressed me most. I'm extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend them!<br /><br />*I received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.*",[],B017JO1TXQ,B017JO1TXQ,AEIW3WB5JDZC5ZCWNE3BW5YNOPGA,1460345149000,0,False

Normally, my hair would have frizzed out and been puffy. Didn't happen though; my hair remained bouncy and straight. Just what I wanted!<br /><br />As a side note - I separated my hair into about 6 sections and applied the smoothing lotion, then brushed it through with a wide-toothed rubber bristle brush. I then sprtized the leave in treatment throughout my hair. After I did that, I was worried that I messed up by combining the two products because my hair felt like it had a film on it.

3.0,"I wanted to love these, but the smells....","I love a relaxing bath in fall and winter, and I purchased these bath salts about six months ago. Some pros are that I like the milky options, they make the bath feel a little more luxurious, and the placebo effect of the milkiness makes me think the salts are actually doing something significant (I dont really think they are, but that's not really the reason I use them anyway). The colors are kind of fun, although the yellow looks a little too similar to dehydrated urine. The huge con for me is the smells are so overtly chemical. They smell like bad laundry detergent. The smell is heavily concentrated when you first pour, as it fills the air of your bathroom with its harsh chemical smell. This subsides a little after a while, but the fake synthetic chemical smell doesn't really relax me.

Now for the smell...<br /><br />... The first time you put this on it may seem strong and even a bit overpowering to some, like many new unfamiliar scents.

4.0,PROS and CONs,"I’ve been single-blade shaving for about 5 years. I enjoy trying out different blades and soaps. This is one of my stand-byes so I can recommend this soap.<br /><br />1. SHAVE: EXCELLENT.  Mitchell’s is very slick and leaves very little tendency to cut or scrape. It results in a close, smooth shave in two passes. Most premium soaps result in a good-to-excellent shave.<br /><br />2. SKIN: EXCELLENT. This product contains lanolin and results in the very best and softest after-shave experience of any soap I’ve tried.  Most premium soaps result in a fair-to-good experience for me.<br /><br />3. VERSATILITY: GOOD. Some soaps seem to shave very well with one brand of blade and not others. Mitchell’s doesn’t seem to mind. I use ASTRA and generally sharp blades.<br /><br />4. LATHER: FAIR. This soap deposits easily onto a wet badger brush, sufficient to lather onto the skin and shave well. It does not whip into a full thick lather if that is important to you. It is also reputed (I have no direct experience) to be difficult to lather at all if you have hard water.<br /><br />5. LATHER DURABILITY: GOOD. The lather on the brush lasts OK during the shave. Easily enough for two passes.<br /><br />6. PUCK DURABILITY: EXCELLENT.  I tend to rotate among several brands of soap, and most milled soaps collect enough water from the brush to decay and dry out somewhat before the puck is finished. Mitchell’s lasts to the end.<br /><br />8. VALUE: FAIR. Mitchell’s is priced about the same as other premium milled soaps. However, if it is sold as a bare replacement puck so you will need a shaving bowel or other container.",[],B06XRZ6Q4Z,B06XRZ6Q4Z,AHMQAQIESRYW3QMPFC2I52XX5EPQ,1629868896181,10,True

5.0,"It's a groomer, not a haircutter","The item has the attachments to cut hair but it is not designed for full-on haircuts.  It's to keep you groomed between haircuts so you don't have to go as often, hence it being called a groomer. Also, if you're having trouble charging it, that's because you're not likely following what it says right in the instructions...it must be charged for a FULL 24 hours before the first use.  Do this, and it works fine. The neckline trimmer is a godsend.  My neck hair grows faster than that on my head so this does nicely for a neckshave when I don't really need a haircut yet.  Professional haircuts are getting too expensive everywhere to go in every 3-4 weeks when you don't need a full cut but do need a touch-up.  This does the trick in that respect.  The nose hair attachment works fine...again, the idea is not to get to the point where the hair is so long and thick that it doesn't work.  Groom it, keep up with it as it grows.  That's what this thing is for.  I have misplaced one of the attachments, unfortunately, so will be buying a new one but this does a a great job, better than the bigger, bulkier products out there.",[],B0001HYKC6,B0001HYKC6,AGTLJYMSCXKU7K2UKAK5N6J6L2SQ,1146363904000,5,True

These are super easy to make out of an extra sock. So... maybe not worth buying.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I ended up getting excited about the the 'topsy tail' things - but they both broke. I put my hair in a pony tail, wrapped some of my hair around the elastic to hide it, and was using the little topsy tail thing to pull that bit of hair back through the elastic / pony tail holder when it snapped.

But I sprayed on liquid hair gel at the roots, teased it with my fingers, & used hair dryer heat to make the roots stick straight up, giving them lift, & also making the hair also flip backwards, which seemed impossible to do at first glance. I have now managed to cover that awful seam, transformed it from stiff, flat & boring to full, natural-looking & silky with no seams showing anywhere.<br />I may order another one to color a little lighter to wear when my red shade fades. I will take a pic of what it first looks like. I have colored many hair pieces, sometimes lightening them first with a color remover like color zap. I also curl them to match my own hair. Will attach styled pics of front, top, back, & underneath.

It is comfortable & stays in place through a 12hr shift. Since I wear this on top of my head, it conceals my thinning hair in front & on top of my head. I blend it over my bangs in front.

I took a shower and used the product last night. The smell of it is something to get used to. Not bad, but not the best smelling thing in the world, lol. It's very smooth (and a tad greasy, but not in a gross way) and left my skin feeling very soft. Went to bed and (knowing not to expect any sudden changes) saw a dramatic reduction in dimpling in the morning! Maybe because I haven't really had cellulite until very recently, but I was very happy and surprised at how my skin looked and felt this morning. Even if it didn't help with cellulite (which it obviously did), I would use it for the simple fact of how awesome it makes my skin feel.

The tresemme stuff was perfect for the winter, I could get up to 4 days with straightened hair, no frizz or oily hair at all. I get a day or two less with this stuff before the dandruff sets in and it looks oily. It feels like it strips my hair of oils, so I can’t get my fingers smoothly through it when wet (before the conditioner) or even when dry and straightened, and my hair frizzes more easily. It does have a pleasant but mild scent. I also feel like I have to use way more to get the same effects while washing. It’s just passing the mark as acceptable for me.

3.0,We'll see how long this lasts...,"Provides a decent shave, particularly after the beard has been moistened as it is immediately after a shower.  The question is, for how long, considering the flimsy construction of some components and the already below-specified battery life.<br /><br />Things they don't describe in the mostly worthless manual:<br /><br />The charging indicator is a steady red AC plug symbol.<br /><br />The LCD indication at full charge is 99.  A RED (not a far more intuitive GREEN) battery full symbol is shown at when the charge reaches 99.<br /><br />A low battery is indicated by a flashing red AC plug symbol when the charge number on the LCD reaches 10.<br /><br />Charge time was tested and found to be 82 minutes.  The manual claims 60 to 90 minutes, so they got that right.<br /><br />Use time is specified in the manual as 50 to 60 minutes. The run time was tested and found to be only 30 minutes in 5 minute on, five minute off intervals, just free running and not being used to shave which should further reduce the run time slightly.<br /><br />The charge indicator was at 52 after 25 minutes and then rapidly dropped from that to 10 only five minutes later causing the low battery indicator to flash, so I would definitely NOT trust the charge indicator to be an accurate indication of how much shaving time you have left. They are apparently not calculating percent charge remaining and displaying it on the LCD, they are simply and far less usefully displaying percent battery VOLTAGE which drops off rapidly at what is called the battery's discharge ""knee."" A cheap route to take revealing that the LCD display is nothing more useful than a gimmick.<br /><br />The manual states that the razor should be unplugged from the charger (this razor package does not come with an AC to USB charge adapter) when the charge number reaches 99, so I suspect this charger might not have an intelligent charger which stops the battery charge process at full charge to avoid battery damage over the long term. So, I will not put this razor on charge and just forget about it until my next shave like I can with my Norelco with its intelligent charge system.<br /><br />Other information:<br /><br />The space under the heads which catches the beard shavings is very small.  Cleaning often will be a must.  We'll see how the hinge and head locking mechanism hold up.<br /><br />When opening the shaving head to clean, put a finger on it to slow its opening, otherwise it will rapidly flip open and if a razor element isn't locked into its place by its flimsy and not very intuitive to correctly replace locking ring, as it wasn't in my case, the razor element and its parts will be vigorously projected into an alternate universe.

So, basically there is NOTHING about it that I can recommend.<br /><br />No matter how good these are at exfoliating, I cannot recommend them due to the offensive/clingy/cloying/LONGLASTING odor.  I have used products like this before and there is always some odor during use...but these, well, days later after soaking my feet in baking soda water and then vinegar water, the incredibly floral+chemical odor still wafts around my head--yes, all the way from my feet!  It is sickening, offensive,, and embarrassing when I am around other people.  Also, the socks I put on after using this product have been washed in hot water and laundry detergent and they are just going to have to be thrown away because the odor DOES NOT come out.

I wanted to try making my own masks asap, and also want to take these when I travel and to throw in beauty gifts (spa in a jar) for friends and family. So the fast shipping and individually wrapped masks were worth paying more for me.<br /><br />I love the concept of soaking these in whatever you like, or placing over a mud mask so that my skin can soak up the benefits and detoxify without drying out too fast. However, these are a bit too small for me width-wise and definitely too small for my hubby (who is willing to sheet mask with me!).  I'll probably buy these again just because I can easily travel with them and use in gifts, but I am going to look for larger ones that I can use on a more regular basis. And once you see the difference sheet masking can do for your skin, you might just look forward to using these as often as you can! I know I do!<br /><br />(I found a really good recipe to brighten and moisturize the face: one egg white, teaspoon of honey, and the juice of a lemon/lime slice.

There's definitely a difference in how they fit over your nose and mouth. My favorite mask, which is stretchy, isn't always practical. I'm not fond of cloth masks because of how they sit on my face, but these brackets actually make them comfortable.<br /><br />Basically, I put the bracket inside a double-layer mask. This works great to keep the bracket from pinching your face while at the same time keeping the mask a little bit further away. The difference in comfort is significant, and it's very easy to forget you're wearing a mask with one of these on.<br /><br />That said, you still need to wash it,and sliding these brackets in and out of a double-layer mask isn't easy.

3.0,Too tight,"Cute style but execution/quality lacking.  The buttons on most were half falling off and when you flipped over you could see why - half the thread came off or was never finished being threaded through the buttons...  Also on all but 2, the underside of the button is super bumpy and hard due to poor quality when they did the button and hem, so it'll hurt your babys head. I wanted to keep these/needed them for a trip to colder weather so I had to sew on felt circles on the underside (secured through the buttons holes to make the loose buttons tighter) & that seems to help make them not hurt her as much however the fit is still too tight, she hates them. I've tried to stretch them but they don't stretch too much and end up popping off my 6 month olds head in about 10 mins.  I'm going to keep stretching them in hopes they will loosen up more....

3.0,Decent,I ordered this style through a different vendor and what I got was not what was pictured and worse quality so I am happier with these.  One of the pearls popped off in shipment but it was easily glued back in place.  The other minor thing is that the white set has white flowers and a slightly ivory-ish band.  Not major and probably wouldn't be noticeable in photos but worth mentioning for those who are sticklers.  The pink flowers have a pink band (not nude or beige like other sellers so that is good).<br /><br />Fit is a bit loose on my 6 month old with 16 in head but it didn't fall off.

4.0,Great for dry skin!,"I wish this was available in stores in the states so that I could have gotten a better match, but alas, it's only available through the internet here. I'm glad I also ordered 53 light beige because I usually end up mixing the two to get it just right. Maybe in the winter this will match better. I also wish there were more shades available, but then ordering over the internet is tough with foundation when you can't compare in person. I apply it with a Real Techniques sponge, and it goes on nice and smoothly. I tried it with a brush, but it kind of looked streaky. Since I also have dry skin, the sponge works better for me anyway. It feels really nice. It feels almost like bare skin but slightly better, like nicely moisturized skin. With a makeup setting spray, I get pretty good coverage for about 8 hours. It might last even longer, but that's as long as I've worn it. Once it seemed to wear off early, but I didn't use setting spray that time either. Also, it's summer and humid here, so I think that makes all makeup wear sooner. I think it would be a great winter time foundation for the extra moisturization and the shade I have is just a shade or two lighter than I need. It is fairly light to medium coverage, but I can build up to good medium coverage. A lot of people comment that it has a fruity smell, and it does but it's not like I pump it into my hand and go 'oh fruit' every time. I have to smell the pumped product on my hand or sponge directly before I notice it.

3.0,Don’t love it but don’t hate it,"This foundation is a tricky one. There are things I really like about it and things that I don’t.<br />I bought it in the shade 04 Honey. In the bottle it looks like an almost exact match to my skin, but when I put it on it’s much paler with a decidedly pink undertone, yet it doesn’t look orange or too pink in my skin. I prefer a neutral undertone though since my skin can be both yellow and pink.<br /><br />I love the bottle and packaging. It comes in a frosted glass bottle with a pink pump and pink cap that snaps on tightly.<br /><br />The coverage is much higher than I expected and it is heavier than expected for a luminous foundation.<br /><br />It covers blue tones better than redness. I have typically had to build it up in areas I have more redness (and we’re talking average redness, not anything extreme) and doing this makes it look much heavier so I end up using a concealer instead. The problem with this lies in the finish.<br /><br />So this foundation’s finish is very confusing and hard to describe. It is very glowy and luminous without being shimmery but it has the heaviness of a matte. I know, confusing.<br />Areas can look too greasy or too dry. It settles into fine lines and creases around the eyes and nostrils. For this reason this is not a foundation I choose for the daytime. It’s much too heavy and shiny for the day, which is a shame because I enjoy it’s longevity. Once I set it with some powder around the eyes and my nostrils I really enjoy it for a night out.<br /><br />I should also mention it is heavily perfumed with a floral scent so those sensitive to scented foundations will likely want to give this a pass. It’s not bothersome to me personally but fragrance can irritate really sensitive skin.<br /><br />All in all I don’t use it as much as I hoped I would and probably won’t repurchase based on that and how heavy it is. At 36 I want a foundation with decent coverage but a lighter feel. It’s also not the easiest foundation to completely remove and when I wear it I have to use a cleaning oil and a cleanser both AND a miceller solution.<br /><br />I have combo skin that can be prone to breakouts with certain brands but I haven’t broken out from this foundation.<br /><br />I enjoy Holika Holika’s BB cream which is why I gave this a shot (and I like a luminous foundation) but I’ll probably stick with the BB cream in the future since it’s lighter.",[],B07KXHWB9D,B07KXHWB9D,AEYFVB4VV6K3FGS463K6Z7RM7NSQ,1567820596035,2,True

However, after using this product for just over a week, I ordered two more bottles.<br /><br />This lotion seems to be controlling the oil on my face. There's a lot less of it now.  I have acne scars and red blotches from 40 years of bad skin, but now my skin tone has evened out. I was also recently diagnosed with sebaceous hyperplasia and my dermatologist said there is nothing to be done except have the spots removed if they bother me. The smaller spots have now vanished and the big one has stopped growing.  This is why I ordered two additional bottles.<br /><br />Also, other reviews complain about the eye dropper.  I've had no trouble using it. The lotion is thin enough that it is easily sucked into the dropper. The only issue is that the outside of the dropper has lotion on it so it sometimes gets on the neck of the bottle when I put it back.  I'd definitely recommend this product.",[],B01GOINCUQ,B01GOINCUQ,AGIJPHHCVX3DATLTBIQTKBJOC6VQ,1558841554967,0,True

5.0,Excellent BBB,"You get what you pay for when buying a boar bristle brush.  This brush has a great feel to it, the handle and weight of the brush in my hand  work well to guide the brush through my long hair.  The purpose of a BBB is not to detangle; it is to stimulate the scalp, spread sebum throughout your length, and use as a finishing brush. One should use a detangle brush or comb before brushing with a BBB. I use the GranNatuarals Boar Bristle Brush in the morning and at night, and I never use it on wash days.  It is not a brush to use on wet hair.  So, if you know this about a BBB, this is an excellent choice in BBB.<br /><br />Also, the weight and shape of this brush make an excellent hair brush paddle choice.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brush on both counts.",[],B00R1TAN7I,B00R1TAN7I,AFDCUYAB2PMEPXN4JQKFCDKF7JRQ,1451926200000,9,True

5.0,Highly recommend this company'S products.,"First, I want to say I bought this at full price....period!<br /><br />I've been very lax over years, at any kind of skin care routine.  My skin isn't really showing any effects of bad skin care, because I was blessed with really good skin, but....I'm 52 now and decided I really shouldn't push it any longer.  So; I purchased Tree of Life Beauty Vitamin C wash first.  I was very impressed with the ingredient list, the amount used to wash my face (neck, chest, and shoulders as well), and the way my skin felt afterwards.<br /><br />So when I saw the toner was 93% organic, I decided buy the Tree of life Beauty Toner, to go along with the wash.  First of all, I really am impressed with the ingredients this company uses.  I grow all organics herbs, berries, vegetables, etc. and use as many organic ingredients that I can.  I would love to be a purist, but my budget says &#34;NO!&#34;  This company doesn't use a lot of needless filler ingredients to stretch the product.  So when you think of the product being only 8 oz, you can be assured that 8 oz (when used properly), is a good amount of product that will last.  I can't say how long yet, as I've only been using it a week.<br /><br />Secondly, being an herbalist has taught me that your skin is your largest organ!  You should be careful what you put on it.  Your pores soak up every last drop of whatever you put on your skin.  Parabens are absolute poison and should be avoided like the plague!  (Sorry all of you Vicks and vasaline lovers out there)  From what I've read about Tree of life Beauty, we're on the same page and I don't feel I need to be concerned about them hiding any in their products.<br /><br />And finally, Vitamin C is essential to your body in too many ways to go into.  But I take a vitamin C daily to help with the absorption of Collagen 1&3 (Which is important for hair, skin, nails, bones, joints, etc).  I had not realized the benefits of vitamin C for your face.  I absolutely love the way my skin feels after using the cleanser and toner.  I let it dry well, then follow up with moisturizer both morning and evening.<br /><br />So far, I'm quite happy with Tree of Life Beauty products and will probably transition to more of their products as I use up what I already have.  We'll see how it goes after using these items for 30 days.",[],B014P8G0SS,B014P8G0SS,AHBA2VLEN2DEPNQDRMV3S2OU6XRA,1462641069000,36,True

3.0,Product packaging concerns,"The name “Honey Bee Smooth Bath & Body Scrub + Moisturizer” just evokes good thoughts, doesn’t it? If you love honey, it just sounds amazing. I know I love honey and I love using it or having it in my beauty products, so I was looking forward to receiving this product to test it out.<br /><br />There are some actual product packaging concerns that really should be addressed by the company that makes this body scrub. First off, the jar is pretty sturdy, I’m not going to dispute that and it’s amber, which is always good in helping keep out UV rays. The ONLY seal is the Amazon barcode label (One of the photos shows the label, but I cut through it, it was intact when it arrived - so that was not the issue). There was no shrink wrap seal, neither was there an inner seal, nor one of those inner lid liners. This jar also does not have ANY other labeling except for that Amazon barcode and the top label with their website URL. This was a standalone jar, no box. There is no product information on the jar, no ingredient list, no product name, no manufacture or expiration dates. This brings up heavy red flags for me – quality control especially.<br /><br />The product description sounds rather amazing, right? Ok, keep in mind what I previously mentioned about quality control. In their description they advertise that you can EAT it. I’d recommend against it because of the lack of quality sealing. It would be one thing if this were given to me by someone who I knew personally that had made the product, but since this is coming from a company that I don’t know and that doesn’t have anything other than the description on Amazon, I’m not sticking this product in my mouth. I know the anti-bacterial properties of honey, however, that doesn’t mean that it can’t be contaminated by anything else -1) it’s not pure honey, there are other ingredients within, 2) who knows the health/sanitation practices of this company, right?, 3) with there just being the barcode label as a seal, who’s to say that someone couldn’t have tampered with it in the warehouse?, and 4) their only label – the one I mentioned with their website URL – if you go to the URL, it comes up with:<br /><br />“This webpage is not available<br /><br />ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED”<br /><br />I don’t know about you, but without anything reputable to back up the product or company, I find it very hard for me to trust this.<br /><br />ALL of that aside, if you can look past those packaging and trust issues, getting to the actual product…<br /><br />When you open the cover, it does have that very rich strong scent of honey. The brown sugar and other ingredients have settled to the bottom, so some stirring was necessary — the honey is also pretty solid, so a cosmetic spatula (not included) was not adequate enough to stir it.  Once you do stir it, the scent of the brown sugar comes through.  Because it’s honey, it’s really sticky, and like any sugar scrub, it has that gritty sugar texture which is great for exfoliation.  If your skin is dry when you apply, you may have a tough time spreading it, to avoid this, moisten your skin prior to smoothing this along.<br /><br />It does its job at exfoliating, removing a layer of dead skin, but I didn’t expect that it wouldn’t. The product itself is good, leaves the skin smooth and smells good – I used it on my leg.<br /><br />It’s not proprietary though, since there are a ton of DIY tutorials on how to make sugar scrubs out on the web nowadays. But if you’re not into making your own and if they change the packaging and labeling and get a working website up, then this would be the way to go.<br /><br />I really hope that they get the concerns I mentioned in the beginning straightened out. It would have been a decent product all around if not for those issues. If they do, then I'd be more than happy to bump the rating to a 4. This product was given to me complimentary in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128FGEK8XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128FGEK8XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6128FGEK8XL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jtc+SkjvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jtc+SkjvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jtc+SkjvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UxHpFKgEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UxHpFKgEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UxHpFKgEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yXxF0XBIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yXxF0XBIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yXxF0XBIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B017E884HQ,B017E884HQ,AEX5OAWDSLAVU3RZFASI57DL2RSQ,1450993312000,1,False

4.0,Not too bad!,Not bad!! There are several reviews saying the tape did not last long in their hair however that was not an issue for me at all. I purchased the silver 18 inch set. My first hair extension application and it went well! Of course my husband had to help!<br />We watched a YouTube video and applied the tape by sandwiching a small section of hair between each. He also used the hair straightener (which I think was the trick for lasting adhesion) to squeeze the tape onto my hair for a few seconds. For the most part they did pretty well. I’ve had them in for about 2 months. They don’t handle washing very well so I tend to really condition the ends and need to trim them occasionally as they will fray a bit and break after a lot of styling. For an inexpensive set I’m not disappointed at all. I was able to curl them as needed as seen in the picture.  Will purchase a higher quality next time so I don’t have to apply so much oil and conditioner to keep them soft.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xm6V0QU6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xm6V0QU6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xm6V0QU6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01LZMV398,B01LZMV398,AGPGHR3F3B2TFZHDOES7VF55VPIQ,1594566638613,0,True

5.0,Works for us!,"These came in within 3 days. Packaged well, out of the 4 rings, only 2 fit. I read the reviews and figured this would happen, but, I had my 4 year old in mind. Others said the rings where for very small fingers.  The smallest knuckle ring my 4 year old daughter wears on her ring finger and loves it. I wear the other one. The large one on my index finger.  They look nice and don't look cheap at all. Me and my daughter both have had many complements.  For the price, I can't complain about 2 of the rings not being able to be worn, my father works leather and actually took the 2 we can't use and he found a use for them.  So, me and my 4 year old daughter are very happy with these rings... To be honest. If only the ring my daughter can wear was all we could use. It was worth the money for her to have her 1st real piece of jewelry that isn't a bendable.. She just adores it. She has worn it every day for four days and it still looks good.  She digs in dirt with it on.  So we r very pleased and I'd order these again if anything happens to the ring i wear or the one my daughter wears.

5.0,Great Argan Oil and Shampoo,"I have color treated hair and am always looking for a good product to use.<br />The shampoo comes with a nice pump and smells wonderful.  It is not too overpowering smelling.  I have used it four times and each time I feel more and more of a difference in the softness and hydration.  It has become glossier as well.  And the smell is amazing.<br />On to the oil ~ I am in love with this stuff!!  I started applying the oil right out of the shower.  It says to start with a few drops, but I apply about a quarter size. I was afraid it would make my hair really oily, but it doesn’t at all.  It adds so much shine and moisture.  It really helps the frizzys and dryness.  I LOVE how my hair feels after I apply it.  In fact, the first time I applied it my son asked me why I kept petting my hair.  So I put some in his hair and he started doing it too.<br />I also love that they do not test on animals.  This is a big factor for me when I am purchasing products.<br />Overall, I am very happy with both of these hair products.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ODVBgfNaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ODVBgfNaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ODVBgfNaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00KOLMAAI,B00KOLMAAI,AHPP4PFMKNBQSFEVKEULEHFXLPKA,1456781403000,0,False

The fact of the matter though is that the entire line of products contain many unefficacious artificial ingredients at best and downright harmful toxins, in effect, at worst.<br /><br />It has plenty of potential but does not deliver.  It seems to me that the makers are not truly interested in answering the riddle to great skin.  It is a start devoid of middle or end notes.  It does not cater to the skin as a complete system.  It will give you a minor improvement and waste a lot of your time.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.  If you love it and are happy good for you.  I will not throw cigarette buds on anyones Eden.  If however you are not a believer like me and want to try another alternative try something with ONLY natural ingredients.

So disappointing and I can't return because I colored it.)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it is a nice wig but there are some flaws.<br /> The hair is soft however it's thin so if you were expecting a full wig, it isn't.<br />Had some shedding straight from the bag and all I did was comb my fingers through.<br />Has a weird funky smell that is hard to get out. Took 3 washes.<br />The upart is skinny And this was the reason why I Took another star away because I  have thin hair. so when I leave it out you can still see the track.<br /> The wig is vry easy to color I was able to color it red and it looks amazing.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bVR4wMSSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bVR4wMSSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91bVR4wMSSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ixUl30qVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ixUl30qVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ixUl30qVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B16s-OUWL0S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B16s-OUWL0S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B16s-OUWL0S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1u0kWozu-S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1u0kWozu-S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1u0kWozu-S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B092D1J7NS,B092D1J7NS,AG3FUNZ6LH5CWUAJZGWBU5S3LD6A,1629493651533,2,True

1.0,"Heck no, this is going back in the morning. Not as pictured, not the same cut, a lot of black hair, not the same color blonde","Not the same hair cut as shown, This is 16 inches,  not 12.  Very shiny. Not exactly ombre, it's basically black (a lot more black than shown) and then it sort of is gray, before it becomes a very pale blonde- not believable at all. This will be returned first thing in the morning. The pictures they used are very deceptive. It had a wave to it but pretty much fell out as I had it out for 5 minutes to take pictures. The cut is all one length, not choppy like it appears in the advertised photos. I DO not recommend this at all, very fake looking. I wouldn't even wear it unless I was going for a Cruella Deville look and then it would be acceptable. Don't buy this if you actually wanted to wear it in real life.<br />I have had platinum hair, and this isn't it. I specifically asked if this was to dark for a caucasian, seller said, it model was a caucasian, hmmmmm. It's way to dark for a caucasian, and I don't think it would look good on darker skinned people either. It looks awful. If I could give it less than 1 star I would.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJzFNFjoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJzFNFjoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MJzFNFjoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hKgnC90-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hKgnC90-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hKgnC90-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lBAJCaenL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lBAJCaenL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lBAJCaenL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81meczxW0tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81meczxW0tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81meczxW0tL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B076BFNZKF,B076BFNZKF,AG5KHTTQP7BIRHE6EILRGPFGBAPA,1516850222169,8,True

4.0,Good product after you learn how to get the oil out of the tube,"At first I had trouble getting anything at all out of the tube.  There was a problem with my cap that prevented anything from coming out. But after taking the cap off the product flowed out. By reading other reviews I learned that the tube must be submerged in hot water for some time to liquify the mixture of oil. Otherwise you get a pebbly mixture. And unless you live in a subtropical climate, one of the oils in the mixture comes out in a semi-solid state and must be rolled between your palms to liquify it as well.  Once that is done, your hands will be pretty thoroughly coated on both sides and between the fingers.  Then you must work it into your beard.  It did a pretty good job of softening my scruffy beard. But now its time to clean the oils off my hands using the sink full of hot water I soaked the tube in.  An oily film can be seen in the water, but my hands still feel oily.  No worries.  The remaining oil get absorbed into my hands.<br />  The instructions say to use a ""manly amount.""  But that begs the question, how much is a manly amount?  It really doesn't require as much as I initially thought.  I guess the fragrance could be described as manly.",[],B07H8V7QJH,B07H8V7QJH,AGK3KD2YIDAEJWRUNQVXK4RVND6A,1612827212282,0,True

I love them because my hair is prone to breakage very easily (and I'm a quarter Armenain, what's up with that?) When I heard regular towels are horrible to dry your hair with, I knew I needed these in my life. They are so soft (even after their first wash) and are so lightweight.

Mostly that you can pay around $200 for the best ones,used by professionals,and,that you need very sharp scissors or shears to cut or trim hair.<br /><br />I've been trimming and shaping my own hair for a long time and am usually happy with the results,considering too many times,when I would go to a salon to have it cut or shaped or trimmed,they did a job I was almost always disappointed with. I decided a long time ago,if someone was going to screw up my hair,it might as well be me. At least I have a good idea on when to stop cutting it and I actually care what the final result looks like.<br /><br />I also have fine,wavy hair. Not the easiest to cut.<br /><br />I have noticed,and maybe it was from using whatever scissors were around at the time,that sometimes the ends do look a bit frazzled;and in researching shears,I found out that unless the blades are very sharp,the ends can break,or result in split ends. I don't have split ends and never noticed them,except for a long,long time ago when I was a teenager;but,I have used these once to do some light trimming and shaping;with wavy hair you are always shaping,cutting with the wave and not cutting against the wave. And,these shears have produced a nice result. And I don't see the somewhat frazzled or lightningbolt effect at the ends of my hair,that I sometimes get.<br /><br />I've used these just once,I only trim my hair to maintain healthy looking ends,and I did it a few weeks ago,and I like these and I'm glad I looked for something better than &quot;any old scissors&quot; that I have on hand.",[],B01AHJY50Y,B01AHJY4YQ,AE363KL3I4VF6SMNR5PN4B4OH4EA,1460357063000,0,True

I sometimes have to go over that area several times to get it as close as I like.<br /><br />The vacuum will only catch about 3/4 of the hair.

5.0,Unexpectedly Pretty Color,"I am already a fan of Josie Maran's color stick in Rosy which I purchased at Sephora late in 2010. I still have half of it left and expect I will run out of it sometime in mid-2013. What a way to stretch a dollar!  I saw this color, Love, which is not available in the store, and was attracted to what appears to be more of an earthy, rich and darker color than Rosy. I ordered it and it arrived yesterday. I was disappointed to find a pale mauvish color and did not have high hopes for how it would look on me, as I have never liked mauve colors on me. This morning I tried it anyway, fully expecting to hate it. Within about 20 minutes I noticed the most natural-looking vibrant bloom in my cheeks, attributable only to this! I love the silky texture  and it does not feel sticky or greasy on my face at all.  Just pure healthy moisturizing (thanks to the argan oil in it) color that I am so glad to have. It has more of a matte effect  on the skin than does Rosy, which is more glossy and sheer. Both colors last all day on my face, even in extreme heat and humidity.<br /><br />The price may seem expensive but considering my first one is still fresh and going strong after 19 months, it's actually a steal! Smells pleasant, too - rather like fresh berries.

I sleep on my face and my eyelashes get pressed up straight up when I'm sleeping. When I wake up they look a hot-mess. The Lashify curler did not help me with this problem due to what I needed to do to fix my problem (no clip to hold lashes). I can first pull the lashes down at the base to have the correct angel again after waking up, and then once they are at the right angle coming off my eyes, I can curl the tops out of the straight mess they become when sleeping.<br />The whole device is made out of hard plastic including the tip.

But I had put so many years on that one, and when it was time to replace the battery and heads (about $80.00 total), I figured it was time to just get a new one.<br /><br />This was the first frustrating part of the process, finding a replacement. Norelco makes so many models. I was looking for one on sale as to limited funds. I soon found out a lot of things I didn't like. These shavers are no longer made in Holland, to fine exacting standards, but are now made in China. They are of varying quality, even within the same model, so you get the luck of the draw. This new model, for twice the money, did not have a battery charge indicator on it, and they no longer have the head height adjustment. And it was LOUD! All for TWICE the price of my old Norelco shaver that was made in Holland, had the battery indicator, and the adjustable heads.<br /><br />So right away, I considered rebuilding the old one. I should have. This shaver grabbed my hair (still does), gives me razor burn, is made out of a more flimsy plastic, doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as with past models, and is just all around a poor replacement, for, did I mention, TWICE THE MONEY!<br /><br />So I've put up with it for years now and am at the same place again. The heads and battery need replacing for a cost of over $80.00 and I'm sure not going to put that into this shaver. So it's off to the reviews again to find a new shaver. I understand that now that Philips has purchased Norelco that their quality has begun to come back up while their prices have stayed the same or even gone done some. I hope this is true as the alternatives don't exist.<br /><br />In a word, you get what you pay for and with the 6843XL Reflex Plus, you don't get much!",[],B00009RB0Z,B00009RB0Z,AFQOWS53WHEFRW2W6AWOQ2MOEMZQ,1248108536000,0,False

The motor sounds ""weaker"" with fewer RPM's than previously-owned Norelco razors and that may be the problem.  2) the routine shave is OK.  3)the small icon indicating the razor needs cleaning lights up after every shave so it's essentially useless. 3) the battery life after a charge is spectacular.  I get a month or more on a re-charge.  4) Assembly and overall quality seems very good.

5.0,excellent,I bought mine years ago when this model first came out.

When this one finally kicks the bucket and is beyond repair I will not hesitate in buying another Norelco. It is built to last with the normal maintenance of cleaning and lubrication and if you are a bit handy it will last far longer. This model has an adjustment for closeness of cut for those with sensitive skin and a basic flip out trimmer on the back. The head assembly flips open and is also easily removable for cleaning as are each of the cutter heads for a more comprehensive cleaning job.

4.0,Best toothbrush made.,"A great alternative to the expensive plug in version.  It has just as much power - maybe more.  Reliability is about the same.  You end up spending more for batteries, but the unit is much cheaper to begin with.  I'm not sure how much electricity costs are for the plug in model.  I subtract a star from both this one and the plug in model because of reliability.  Over the years I have had almost everything go wrong from dead batteries to bad switches to corroded wires to just plain dead.  The first one I had lasted 4 years.  None have since.  These units are not repairable.  Expect them to last a year, maybe two.<br /><br />This unit has the exact same mechanism as the expensive plug in model and uses the same replacement heads and is about the same size.  The batteries come out the bottom and there is an O ring seal there.  If moisture is allowed to enter it will mess up the battery compartment.  If you stand it vertically after use rather than laying it down it will last much much longer because the water drains off it.  I get a month, sometimes two, out of a set of batteries.<br /><br />Do not buy the suggested newer model of this for $15.  It's not the same as the others.  It a motor driven thing with a huge head that is hard to use and doesn't do near as good of a job.  It's small and cheap.

Well, I must say, I am very pleasantly impressed with this palette. It has a good mix of mattes, satins, and glitters, and even the glitters, after an initial fall off of the large particles look pretty good.

Now the line doesn't work well with older skin, and Benefit doesn't really have a line that is made for older skin. Also, their other lines don't have the warm/yellow undertone.

5.0,Very Nice!,"Update 05Oct2020:<br />I used the lavender bath bombs last night and remembered to take pictures of the water this time. The lavender bomb really did make my water a very pretty purple. When I used the eucalyptus bath bomb, it really did my water a really pretty blue green color. My tub didn’t stain, nor did my bath billow. And since I got rid of the horrendous item that I kept having to mess with that caused me to make the pillow keep sliding, the pillow stayed put this time. I HIGHLY recommend this product!<br /><br />I received this two days ago, 19 September 2020, and I put it to use yesterday 20 Sept 2020. I’m really happy with this purchase. My initial impression was very positive. It really did look like it came straight out of a spa. It was squishy and felt comfortable. The bathbombs were a great touch. And it came with a very large mesh bag so that you can wash in there and not ruin it (I think, that’s what that is for). When I used it yesterday, it really did feel comfortable and there were no pressure pains. It did slide a bit down, but was easy to slide back up into position (I think it was also sliding because I kept having to adjust another item not from this purchase). The bathbomb that I used yesterday was the eucalyptus one. The fragrance in the box was nice, once I opened it, the fragrance was more subtle. It turned my bath water blue! It looked really nice but then I was thinking it was going to stain my tub blue. After I drained my tub there were no stains (phew!). The actual bath pillow was very easy to rinse off and hang up to dry. It was overall a very pleasant experience. The way this came, would make a great gift for someone. I know I would LOVE to have received this as a gift.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WkQHRK-rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url':

4.0,Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub,"I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so.  As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off.  If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too.  The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want.  Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results. I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off.  Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful.  However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.",[],B01E6EWCA6,B01E6EWCA6,AE2WFO6376DYD2DT4HPNT3L2HQSA,1488162823000,5,True

5.0,Velvety feel - creates a matte effect and reduces the appearance of pores and wrinkles.,"This product has been a 'must have' since I discovered it.  When I received my first bottle, I applied to half of my face to see if it made a difference and it really does, in terms of minimizing the appearance of fine lines and pores by creating a matte-like foundation!  When the bottle is approaching empty, the product gets crumbly and I tend to discard the bottle before it is completely empty, which is a shame.  A couple of tips I've learned about using this product - 1. When spreading the product on your face, spread in the direction that your peach-fuzz facial hairs grow.  2. Keep it away from your brows as it will look crumbly and flaky (like eyebrow dandruff?) if it gets into them.  Otherwise it is great and I often use it with no other makeup.",[],B00TPQY86M,B00TPQY86M,AFBAKJREQ3FLCE5DELQXSODNWCBQ,1534427656852,0,True

3.0,Great concept - just falls short of the intended use!,"I was really curious about receiving this product - as I LOVE the concept. I am constantly looking for a cover for my razors - both to keep them clean and to prevent my little ones from coming in contact with the blade. Unfortunately, this design just really falls short. There is a metal plate within the clamp like pod which the blade sits against when the pod is closed. I understand the metal was likely placed there to protect the blade and prevent unnecessary dulling and the build up of gunk. Most razors on the market today have a strip of lotion or emollient along the top of the blade. Unfortunately, the metal from the pod kept fusing to the strip causing both the strip to come off and the plastic of the pod to pull free - resulting in both a broken pod and a damaged and unusable razor. I would also caution this company regarding the name and claim of the product. Although the product is meant to provide a protective cover to the razor -  it by no means provides any sort of sterile environment.... thus I do think calling this a “steripod” might be a bit misleading.",[],B076ZVR6QF,B076ZVR6QF,AE4I4MNFZ43RH4CS7YWJIXCBNDGQ,1582473317066,1,False

Here it is, at least 4 months later and, even with generous daily use, it's only this morning I had to open the new tube.  Great product, lasts a long time, easy to apply and well priced.

I was not overly impressed with this at first.  The pressure washer attachment came connected to the hose nozzle and it was an absolute pain to remove (my husband had to use pliers to get it out).  It was easy enough to attach to the hose but somewhat a pain to take off.  It also only seems to have 2 spray patterns, not 4 like advertised (a hard ""line"" spray and a softer line spray).<br /><br />I was not comfortable spraying my flowers with this because it seemed to spray fairly hard, even when I turned the nozzle to reduce the spray.  So, I started spraying off the mold on my sidewalk.  Our house faces north and is fairly shaded in the front and, since it rains a lot in Florida, tends to get mold build-up on the front sidewalks.  As you can see from the picture I posted, this nozzle does actually help spray off mold.  It's not quite a pressure washer but it was able to remove the heavy stuff (but, remember, it does come with the pressure washer attachment).  I am giving this four stars because it's not quite what I expected but it does help remove mold from cement, which makes it worth having.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tCQex2hHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tCQex2hHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tCQex2hHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07TVBW1HT,B07TVBW1HT,AGDLQLN76BSCUR4IFDX4NA2XEAOA,1568036316466,0,False

Its better than other products at twice the price.,[],B00VIYHWUS,B00VIYHWUS,AFUW5OPUAY5TKN6WZXZCXTRXUDYA,1441932488000,1,True
3.0,A Thick and Rich Eye Cream.,"EDITED REVIEW as of 9/25/21.<br /><br />I came back to edit this review and to lower my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. Here's why:<br /><br />After a few weeks of using this cream, I started to develop some sensitivity to it. When I say sensitivity, here's what I mean: 1) The scent bothered me more than it did when I first used the cream. In fact, I started to sneeze most evening after applying it. 2) I'd used the cream on other areas of my face, and noticed minor breakouts in those areas.<br /><br />Basically, I think the cream was just too oily for my skin. Even around the eye area, which has virtually no oil glands, the non-absorbency of the cream left me feeling sticky and greasy even though I gave the cream plenty of time to absorb.<br /><br />End of Edit.<br /><br />***************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Everything else I said in my original review still stands. But the above edit may help you decide if this is the right eye cream for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a natural, plant-based eye cream that is ultra-thick and rich, you'll find it in this 2 oz. jar.<br /><br />The jar will last a VERY long time, because you only need a tiny amount of this cream to cover the undereye area and the corners where crows feet form.<br /><br />I'd advise putting the cream on a couple of hours before bed, since it takes quite a while to absorb into the skin. (If you don't wait, you'll end up depositing most of the cream on your pillowcase.)<br /><br />I've also used a small amount of this cream on other areas of my face (nose to mouth lines) and the results were the same as around my eye area.<br /><br />So what were the results? The skin around my eye area looked smoother and brighter after one night of use.<br />The results on other parts of my face were less noticeable, but I believe continued use of the cream will improve the results in both the eye area and on the face.<br /><br />I'm rating the cream 4 stars instead of 5, because of one major issue I have with it, which is: THE SCENT.<br />The cream has a rather strong minty (?), menthol (?) medicinal smell that takes some time to fade away.<br />Since I prefer NO SCENT in eye/facial products, I deducted one star from my rating.<br /><br />That aside, if scented products don't bother you, and you want a thick, rich eye cream you will probably enjoy using this one.",[],B095VQX4DV,B095VQX4DV,AGDYFDP4Q23S6M3U2W3QS5KBDROQ,1630241617771,0,False
5.0,Gives a QUICK and CLOSE Shave.,"I ordered this for my partner, who has been using a 3-head rotary shaver to shave his head. This one does a far better job!  It has many great features, including:<br /><br />1) It arrives fully charged, ready to use.<br /><br />2) Along with the 6-head shaving attachment, It has just about every shaving accessory you could want; a facial cleansing brush, sideburn trimmer, nose/ear trimmer, face cleaning sponge.<br /><br />3) It is washable.<br /><br />4) It comes with the USB cord for charging, and you get approximately 90 minutes of shave time after 1.5 hours of charging.<br /><br />HERE'S THE BEST PART: It gives a QUICK and CLOSE shave to my partner's head, with no tugging or pulling.<br />He said ""This is like having a riding mower for my head, versus a push-mower"". LOL! I think that's a pretty good testimonial.<br /><br />As a final note, the price is reasonable, especially considering all the good features of this unit.<br /><br />P.S. to the ladies: I think the 6-head attachment could make a great shaver for your legs, so you might want one of your own. :>)",[],B095KFXNV7,B095KFXNV7,AGDYFDP4Q23S6M3U2W3QS5KBDROQ,1627913836146,0,False
5.0,"Pretty scent, silky feel.","I've tried many brands of purple shampoos/conditioners in the never-ending battle against brassy tones.<br />This is one of the better brands.<br /><br />First of all, I love the scent. It is vaguely floral, definitely a feminine scent. It smells wonderful in the shower, but I like the fact that it fades quickly once you rinse it away. It doesn't linger all day, meaning it won't compete with any other fragrance you are wearing.<br /><br />Second, I like the fact that this set is gentle, and non-drying. (Some other brands have left me with straw-like hair after a few uses.) This combo cleans gently, and leaves the hair feeling silky.<br /><br />Third, the toning is effective. There is a visible difference after just a couple of uses. I saw the yellow/orange tones had faded after the first use, and after the second, my hair was shiny and showed highlights, but there was a marked difference in the amount of brassiness.<br /><br />Fourth, I like the fact that the shampoo is natural (made with botanicals) and is sulfate and paraben free. It is also cruelty free, another big plus. The pump bottles are also great, making the shampoo and conditioner easy to use in the shower. They are plastic, so no breakage issues.<br /><br />Finally, the price is right. The shampoo and conditioner bottles each contain 16.9 fl. oz of product. A good buy.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a solid 5 star set. Recommended!",[],B08RY6S25W,B08RY6S25W,AGDYFDP4Q23S6M3U2W3QS5KBDROQ,1621517182996,1,False
4.0,7 tools for just over $7 dollars.,"This manicure set comes boxed, and tightly wrapped in plastic. It seems like you get a lot with this little set. The implements include scissors, 2 pair of nail clippers, a file, etc.<br /><br />All the implements are rather ""lightweight"", meaning just that. They don't feel like heavy-duty metal. And maybe it's because of the light weight, but they don't seem especially sharp.  They do an okay job clipping the nails, but just okay.<br /><br />Still, you get 7 tools for just over $7 dollars, so if you want just a basic manicure set, or something to travel with, this set will be good enough for that.",[],B084YVBBH6,B084YVBBH6,AGDYFDP4Q23S6M3U2W3QS5KBDROQ,1592403708833,0,False
5.0,Sampler set is a great way to try English Laundry.,"There are four bottles included in this nicely packaged set. The set comes in a dark brown ""textured"" heavy cardboard box, wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve. I mention the specifics of the packaging, because the pretty packaging makes it gift-ready. (Just add a bow or a ribbon, a name tag, and you're done!)<br /><br />Despite the fact that I'm calling this a ""sampler set"" the 20 ml bottles are good size. (Not tiny little things.) There's plenty of product to use each fragrance for awhile. (You can really get to know the aromas this way. It's not a one-and-done type of sampler.)<br /><br />All four fragrances are pleasant, clean, and crisp. My partner likes Oxford Bleu and Riviera the most. He says these have a ""fresh"" smell to him. (I agree!. The Oxford Bleu is my favorite.)<br /><br />If you're not familiar with English Laundry scents, this set is a great way to try several of their offerings.

I miss my old Wahl clippers they were a super workhorse set of clippers. I had no idea that Wahl even made shavers.<br /><br />I have had quite a few high-end electric shavers, and they all have the same problem, they just don't shave as close as a razor. The positive thing about electric shavers is that they are easy to use for quick touch ups and convenient shaves when you don't want to mess with water and creams and lotions.<br /><br />This Wahl shaver, in particular, is pretty nice. It shaves about as close as other electric shavers, which isn't as close as a manual razor, but with repeated use and going back and forth, it is better than no shave. Some type of pre-shave lotion, like Williams Lectric shave, helps a little.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty decent shaver. It charges fast and holds the charge for a long time. The top pops off easy to clean the blades. You can use the provided brush or just rinse it off with water. You can also use it in the shower or wet/dry shave. The directions say not to submerge it under 3 feet of water.<br /><br />It also has a shaver that pops up for sideburns or whatever you would want a clean smooth line on.

4.0,Well Made Unit,"This is an extremely well-made unit and appears completely waterproof.  It charges in about an hour with a charge that lasts me four showers.  While it removes some skin I would prefer stiffer rubber “bristles.”  The handle is made of a slippery plastic that is impossible to hang into with soapy hands.  Probably OK for the bathtub, but risky in the shower.  Men usually have larger backs and are less flexible.  So I made a longer “handle” with a 12” PVC pipe, attached with a gasket and a hose clamp, easily removed for charging.  The pipe also doesn’t slip in a soapy hand.  With all the running gear in the head the unit is top heavy when in the charger.  Even the suction cups on the charger base can’t hold it upright.  However, the gasket for the handle also pushes the unit enough off center to balance it and prevent fall overs.  The instruction sheet is a riot.  It reads like it was run from Chinese through a translation program into “English.”  The best line is “Especially designed with horny brush and thus removing residual horniness.”  If only it were so simple!

5.0,Performance Just Like the Dentist Office BUT for ~ $140 on Sale now,"We tried several home teeth whitening kits and most gave marginal results.  But this kit, performs just the same as what you get at the Dentist.  Look at the picture I posted.  Its the teeth color card. Out of 1 - 20, my wife started with 14 top and 11 bottom. She drank a lot of coffee, red wine, etc...We tried this kit and got her down to 4 top and 2 bottom. Her teeth are just as white as the dentist office whitening service.  Here is what separates this kit from others: 1) Performance is second to none, 2) You get most of the whitening results the first application which is 8 minutes.  Remember with this kit, you have to do 4 sets of 8 minutes per day.  Meaning a total of 32 minutes total per day.  Getting most of the whitening in the first 8 minutes is amazing results 3) It only takes 5 days and 2.5 vials total out of the 10 vials that comes with the kit.  Meaning she can maintain her whiteness for the next 4 months without spending more. The procedure costs ~$400 at the dentist. You pay ~$140 - $150 for this kit for the same fast results and can maintain it for 4 months, depending on your teeth.  Meaning out of all of the teeth whitening solutions available, this one ends up being the MOST COST EFFECTIVE with guaranteed results.  Meaning if your teeth were able to whiten before, you should get the same whitening again.  My teeth can't be whitened because how they developed before my permanent teeth came out. I had a high fever so my teeth are a little yellow as a result and can't be whitened much even at the dentist.  At any rate, this is the real thing and you keep the blue light system and battery pack.  Just buy more vials later when you run out.

It reminds me of my mother's Pond's face cream of the 50's.  It goes on light and feels instantly moisturizing on your skin.  Doesn't soak in quickly.  Everyone seems to really love this cream according to all the reviews I saw on the internet. It is creamy and light and feels great when you first put it on.  Just one important thing the reviews don't tell you - after a short time,the cream will begin to ""ball up"" on the face if you wear it under makeup. Fine for going to bed but give it an hour so it doesn't come off on the pillow.  Nowhere have I seen anything about it balling up mentioned, so I am only giving you a heads up on the fact that it does this.  Otherwise, it does moisturize your skin very well and will last a long while during the day if you don't wear makeup over it.  When I am home, I usually apply after my shower and wear no makeup.

How it felt,  how it didn't shed even after it was colored, the whole time she was doing my hair today and yesterday. She loved it!! The only minus, I didn't think it laid as well after coloring (which as she explained may happen due to stripping but the hair still lays really good, feels and looks GREAT). It's extremely versatile. I'll definitely buy this hair again,  may not color it but definitely a must buy!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GkVAIm09L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GkVAIm09L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GkVAIm09L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fikUm35OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fikUm35OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fikUm35OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tSxmN5uEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tSxmN5uEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tSxmN5uEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01HODJ8XA,B01HODJ8XA,AEQB2FQCKIDYHOJMLLFZ7VYBQ4MQ,1514530438368,0,True

5.0,Love the curls and price!,"I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love the curls this bubble wand produces!

I went to work at the hospital and needless to say, it lasted my entire 8 hour shift without hair products/hair spray! Everyone loved it as they never see me with curly hair unless I’m going out LoL The on my thing I don’t care for is the stand for placing it down, as I had to keep flipping it up and down when I was curling my hair. One thing I can recommend is to section your hair and when curling, only curl a small section at a time because if you grab too much hair (I have a lot of hair and thick hair too), then it won’t curl well. Another thing is, I can’t guess how long to hold my hair on the wand before releasing so I’m just guesstimating and pray I’ve held it long enough to get the curl I want. I’m too afraid of holding too long, damaging my hair. I purchased this item bc it was on sale for less than $19, saving me $20, so I figured I’d give it a try. I also purchased a TYMO airflow flat iron/curler (on sale too) at the same time as this purchase and tested both products and since I love both, I’m keeping both!

5.0,Norelco replaced my old Braun,"I just got my first Norelco model 8825 XL, after 7 years using a Braun 4501. I considered these two brands the top in the electrical shaving industry. In some aspects I founded the Norelco reigning over the Braun and in other aspects the Braun is much better. So, the question you should ask yourself is what type of hair are you trying to shave?<br />Let first look at the Norelco series:<br />The different between the Norelco's Spectra (8000 series), Quadra (7000 series), Advantage (6000 series), and the Reflex (5000 series) is one major feature added to each series. The Reflex sports the basic &quot;Lift &amp; Cut&quot; system. The Advantage is the same but include a lotion dispenser. The Quadra's &quot;Lift and Cut&quot; system has two types of head with a slot and hole. The Spectra series has what the Quadra does, but include a comfort control. Both the Quadra and Spectra don't have lotion dispenser. There are also more special features that can be found in each series by looking at the 2nd digit. For example the Spectra 8894 have a digital screen where the bare-bone lower number Spectra 8825 have just a green light.<br />The performances, Norelco vs. Braun:<br />I have soft hair in the beard area and thicker hair around the lips (mustache and chin area). The Norelco does a superior job in the beard area; it cut it clean with a couple of strokes. When using the Braun (older model 4501), I sometime have to use a long trimmer and then go back over with the coil. The Norelco three individual heads move over the sides of the face a lot better. Braun does do a superior job over the mustache area. It coils has more and bigger holes then Norelco. The Spectra with it dual slot and hole head is good but takes longer time to cut down the thicker stub. The old Braun battery (NH-) is dying on me. Norelco battery (NiCd) is replaceable and you use it charged or just plug and play, which the Braun could not do. Overall, I prefer the Norelco's design.<br />The features I like:<br />I am still playing with the Personal Comfort Control and am not sure if it is necessary. The more sensitive the level is the long it takes to cut so far. The long hair trimmer is great, but that is almost standard in most models, but not the Advantage's Series. Plug and play is great, since I don't travel every day. Cleaning is simple; just rinse it in the sink. I like the solid construction the Norelco's design is, the rotating machine is fun to use and is very smooth.",[],B00006K0X1,B00006K0X1,AEJH3SYBWETZTZMWJSILGGAPMFOQ,1075440467000,16,False

5.0,This last year it's gotten pretty bad. I decided to give this stuff a ...,"So I have been dealing with adult acne for well.. 10+ years. This last year it's gotten pretty bad. I decided to give this stuff a try, because why not... Well it is actually making a difference, like more than anything else I have tried. I have only been using it a week, but I am seeing a reduction in new acne and I am seeing the skin production rate sort of go up so my skin is healing faster. I think this product causes minor inflammation of the face, which is partially responsible for the smooth looking skin. I am seriously very impressed with this product, and I will follow up in a few more weeks with hopefully some even better results.<br /><br />I am using Tretinoin .05 also, which dries up my skin a ton.

4.0,Great Color Mix!,"[[VIDEOID:d010ece8d43b68cbe6e2101e19e10843]] Four stars because I like to have a root in my hair so I had to add my own. The color quality is amazing for the price! The wig had tones of pink and peach which made it look more natural. It had some brown in it to extend the color range to add a more realistic look to it. The shine was not too bad and by adding dry shampoo it took most of it away. The lace is fairly light Which can be nice because it makes it easy for any concealer or powders to show up to match skin tone. I have a fairly small head and the straps adjusted enough to fit my head. If you are looking for a bublegum pink, this is not it.

2.0,Disappointing.,"This product is very disappointing.  Initially I was excited to find a non-peel nail polish that was water based - I'm allergic to harsh chemicals, so traditional nail polish isn't an option.  I've used Suncoat peelable nail polish before and liked it a lot because it was completely odor free and did not cause any allergic reaction.  It did not last long on my nails, but I figured it was essentially meant for kids, so it's OK it if only lasts for a few hours.  I was only wearing it out for dinner, etc.  Then I've found out that Suncoat also makes water based polish that is non-peel.  I figured I would give it a try.  I've read multiple reviews stating that with proper application the product would last a few days on the nails.  2 or 3 days of wear are more than enough for me as I like to change my colors often.  Also, I understand that water based polish would never be as durable as the traditional polish, so I was perfectly OK to change it out every couple of days.  As soon as the product arrived I applied it as instructed. I did it shortly before bed time so that I wouldn't get my nails wet and allow the polish to cure.  By the time I woke up it had already chipped!  So, I reapplied and went to work.  By the time I got to work it was chipped again!  This was embarrassing; I spent good 20 minutes trying to scrap the polish off my nails.  Luckily, it came off easily.<br /><br />What's even more disappointing is that Suncoat customer service does not seem to care about customers.  I've contacted them asking if they had any helpful advice and so far received no response.",[],B016V28NQI,B016V28NQI,AESQKJ2QCIEUC6ZMW3ORCZINWJ5Q,1459266139000,2,True

It seems both easy to clean and durable. The design of this pillow allows you to fold it over the top of the tub or use it more submerged. I don’t always feel like getting my hair wet, so I appreciate having versatility. I also think the attached hook is a nice touch. I can easily hang it to dry in my shower. I’ve always enjoyed my bath time, but enjoy it even more with my new pillow.",[],B07RHL64VV,B07RHL64VV,AEURY6VILFSC7FPRGKW2T2PAIDAQ,1585194147830,9,True

The scents are lovely and I wish I could describe them in detail, but the last four perfumes I bought are more diluted each time and I can't pick up on the depth of the fragrances. I even wrote an email to Auric Blends politely voicing concern. I understand perfume ingredients must be expensive, but &#34;watering down&#34; perfumes with carrier oil to make the batch more cost efficient is compromising the product. I, and I believe many of my fellow Auric Blends fans will agree, would be fine with a small price increase if it meant the perfumes could be concentrated again. I sincerely mean that, because I like this company.<br /><br />The latest two I purchased are Sandalwood and Divine Opium. Sandalwood is woody and sweet. Divine Opium has similar notes to my favorite Black Opium but a little brighter.

Unless you have eyes the size of an elephant you end up wasting a lot of this lovely eye serum because the pump will not allow you to dispense a small amount. It actually pumps out at least three times what you can use. This kills me, especially as the product is a bit pricy. I have tried a few different ways to get it out in a more efficient manner but because of the way that it is placed in the bottle and the type of pump it is simply impossible. I will use the rest of what I purchased but sadly will not buy again because I feel as if I am throwing away money with the product waste. As for the serum I have noticed a difference around my eyes.

As a beginner I want to get good at the technique and this gel is great for that.  I found it is better to do one nail at a time as the gel settles a little.  Also the nail forms are so arched you end up with a terribly thick nail.  If you like short nails go for the paper form instead.<br /><br />The supplies will last a few months.  I do my nails every two weeks and found this kit needs to be redone weekly due to lifting.

I wasn’t expecting much.<br />Right away I noticed something I like: The smell is neutral.<br />So I tried it once and my skin looks AMAZING. Mind you, it did not irritate my skin. This is significant as I have rosacia.  I did not look red or pink, which is a pleasant surprise as my skin is very fair with blue undertones.  Any bit of redness shows on my skin, so I was so pleased to see plumper skin, fewer fine lines, brighter skin, and no skin irritation. I use this anytime my skin needs a little extra hydration. It does the trick. Remember- a little goes a long way. Just like 90’s lip gloss.",[],B07V1P1WNY,B07V1P1WNY,AHMVG5L77T7BMV7PVR3ALV5B2JPQ,1591570777481,6,True

5.0,Thrilled with this mask!!,"I love this product! It comes in a small container so I was kind of bummed at first, but what little product is in here packs a powerful punch.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a clay or mud type of mask to clarify and clear your skin. I suffer from deep cystic acne and broke out earlier this week. I put on this mud mask and I could not believe how great the results were. Within one day my pimples had disappeared and even my damage spots seem to be less noticeable.  My skin felt super soft and clear.<br /><br /> I have a pretty sensitive skin but I didn't have any irritation from this whatsoever. The package says to leave the mask on for 10 or 15 to 20 minutes but I noticed that even after 20 minutes, the mask still was not dried so I did leave it on for longer.  It is a bit of a drying mask so if you already have dry skin, you will want to use a moisturizer following the mask.  I found that when I combined it with my acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, it was just to drying for my skin. Therefore, I would recommend maybe skipping a day of other chemical products when you use this mask.<br /><br /> The mask it goes on really nice and smooth. I used a Q-tip to mix up the mask material as the directions say to stir it each time you're going to use it.  Then I just used the Q-tip to apply the mask and I from layer on my face.  The mask has a cooling a fact and isn't a dry or itchy at all. It was a very pleasant experience overall. It wasn't messy at all to use either.<br /><br /> I posted some pictures below of the material in the jar as well as when it was on my face.  That way, you can see how quickly I put the mask on my face.  I hope the photos are helpful.<br /><br /> Again, I recognize that this is a smaller container than I had previously thought, but you don't need much to cover your entire face. Although I can't say for sure, I am guessing that I would get at least 10 to 15 masks with this product. That is quite a bit considering how much is charged for mud mask facials at spas.  Do you make sure that you see all the container tightly and store it in a cool or dark place as it will dry out quickly if you leave it open.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MlV2Z84DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MlV2Z84DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MlV2Z84DL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iVIgISUjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iVIgISUjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iVIgISUjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dQ59uIP3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dQ59uIP3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dQ59uIP3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00Q5V41NK,B00Q5V41NK,AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ,1477161276000,2,False

5.0,great set of hair clips--flexible hold and durable for styling,"I LOVE these!!  I have recently gotten into dyeing my hair crazy unicorn colors and I've gotten sick of ruining my really expensive hair clips with all of the permanent dyes.  So I decided to invest in this 6-piece set of clips since I've seen my hair stylist use these when she is separating my hair into different pieces.<br /><br />Anyway, I have really long and thick hair.  So when I'm dyeing my hair, which I do at home, I really need to section the hair pieces off to make sure I get all of the strands saturated with color.  Otherwise, well, I'm not really into striped hair at the moment and uneven dye jobs that LOOK like I did it myself at home after drinking too much wine ;)<br /><br />I got the RED color because I have purple hair and wanted the clips to stand out.  I do not plan to wear these out of the house--they are only for my styling needs at home.  Otherwise, I would recommend getting a darker color because the plastic isn't super nice or stylish looking.  I like that these clips open easily and don't have a super strong grip.  Some of my clips are way too tight and I end up pulling my hair out or getting my hair stuck in the coils.  I like the more flexible feel of these and that they have more give, so I can move them around.  Even though they are flexible, they still hold the hair in place, but just do it less harshly, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I like the set of 6 because I tend to lose track of my clips and so this way, I will have a nice sized supply and won't always be running around my house searching for clips.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I hope you found my review helpful and that I provided enough detailed information so that you can determine whether or not this product is right for you and your lifestyle needs.

5.0,Beautiful rainbow set of glass nail files!,"I've been wanting to try the glass nail files now for several years.  The cost of them was always a deterrent until I found this great 5 piece value set.<br /><br />I was so excited to get them and try them out. I was so tired of buying  nail files over and over again only to have them break or bend in my purse or just wear out after a month or two. I wanted to invest in something that would last a little bit longer even if it was more than the usual dollar store Emery boards I've become so frustrated with. It seems the cheap files I had been buying were constantly had to replace them.<br /><br />The nail files were shipped to me promptly and they are not only extremely functional, but beautiful. I ordered the rainbow set of 5 and they're soooo pretty.  My favorite is the emerald green one, which is so much more vibrant than it appears in the stock photo and In my crappy phone photo.  I love them. The set comes with a hard case to store them in. And the 5  files in their cases come in a larger zipped pouch!  they are the perfect size to throw in a purse, keep in my desk at work, stow in the console of my car, and store in my makeup bag while still having one extra in my medicine cabinet at home.  When you consider how much I spend on files for my nails and feet on a monthly basis, and I should never have to replace these --- they come with a lifetime guarantee. That is just crazy to me. I will be buying these for gifts for sure. I can’t wait to tell everyone about them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion/review. If I had paid full price for it, I would still say the same thing. I rely heavily on reviews before I make a purchase so I realize how important they are. Hopefully, you have found this review helpful. Thanks and happy shopping!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VLlDf1tuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VLlDf1tuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VLlDf1tuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71axGJWRVfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71axGJWRVfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71axGJWRVfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01EKSKUL6,B01EKSKUL6,AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ,1463105230000,3,False
3.0,The All Natural way to remove nail polish!,"I'm puzzled by this product.  I loved the idea of having a natural, non-toxic nail polish remover.  I paint my own nails quite often, skipping the nail salon to save money and time.  I've been giving myself manicures and pedicures since 6th grade, so I'm pretty good at it (if I do say so myself) and am well-versed in many of the products out there.  I typically use a 100% acetone remover, which is AWESOME, but I hate that there are so many harmful chemicals, not only on my nails, but also in the fumes I'm breathing in every time I use it.  So, when I saw this product, I was excited and motivated to try it and like it.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was also pleased with the size.  I had assumed it would be pretty small because of the way the dropper looks next to it in the picture, but it's actually a good sized bottle.  Before using any product, I read the directions and particularly with a new type of product like this non-toxic, all-natural nail polish remover.  That's when I saw that you have to leave the product on the nail for 2-5 minutes.  I don't understand this because once you use the dropper to apply the product to the nail polish that's on the nail, it immediately starts dripping down the sides of the nails onto your hands and makes a bit of a mess.  It's also pretty inconvenient to sit there for 5 minutes when I could use my regular nail polish remover and would have clean nails in 30 seconds to a minute.  I decided instead to try pouring the product into a shallow bowl and soaking my nails in it instead.  This did make it much easier and created less of a mess, but it also requires you to use a lot more of the product than you would just using the dropper.<br /><br />I waited 2 minutes and took a cotton ball to swipe the nail to see if the polish would come off.  It started to, but just the top layer.  I re-soaked them in the product for 3 more minutes, and I was able to remove the polish from my nails.  I should also mention that I use Orly bonding base coat, which helps the polish adhere to the nail.  I also had 3 coats of polish, and a top coat, so that might be why the polish was so stubborn to come off.  Plus, it was a deep red, which is difficult to remove no matter what you are using, and it usually dyes my nail beds a bit when I'm removing the polish anyway.  As a positive, I did notice that this product was MUCH less harmful on my nails.  My acetone remover immediately dries out my nails and strips all the healthy oils from the nails and nail beds.  This did not do that.  My nails had a nice, healthy shine to them and the nail beds retained their moisture, which is nice.<br /><br />So, in summary, I love that this product is natural and non-toxic, but it's just not practical for me to spend 5 minutes soaking my nails to wait for the polish to come off.  However, if you are super green and more willing to commit to being patient in order to be able to use something that has no chemicals and is good for your body and those around you (which I commend you for!), then this is a great substitute for chemical nail polish removers.",[],B01AYTGWA8,B01AYTGWA8,AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ,1459178224000,0,False

3.0,"Works well, until the nozzle snaps","I was happy with this product for the first two weeks I had it, but unfortunately, it fell from the counter of my bathroom, which caused the nozzle to snap. Because the construction of this piece relies on ""twisting"" to replace/remove the nozzle, it was impossible to ""twist"" the snapped fragment out of the terminal, which rendered my flosser useless. The other components work well, but unfortunately, this is a major design flaw. I will not buy this model again, and instead, I will opt for a more expensive model with a better mechanism for removing/attaching the nozzle because it is more expensive (and wasteful) to have to replace the entire device than to replace just one component",[],B09B4Y3Z41,B09B4Y3Z41,AFNEUVDYI7DS3N3JZG3XXNB3MS2Q,1643755807804,0,True

The one without flash you can kinda see the colored reflects I’m talking about. I painted over grown out white acrylics so you can tell the difference in opaqueness around my cuticles so you’d have to do a white base. This is more ideal as a topper instead of standalone.

The hairline issue is not fixable.<br />The grey wig---I love that one too. My second favourite. It's got those great dark roots. It is very long so tangling may be an issue depending on use.

You can also style it off your face too.<br />The hair is cut in a long shag style, with some bits in the back much shorter. This gives it the full look.

First, at least at the time of this review, the price is decent.<br />The purple shampoo is a deep violet. I applied it to my wet hair and worked it in. Loved the purple lather. Then applied the conditioner which is more of a deep inky blue.  The instructions said to leave it in for a few minutes. When I wash it out, my hair feels differently--it feels as though there's still something there on my hair, but deeply mixed in. It feels differently than when I use regular shampoo.<br />Anyway, I love what this does for my hair. It seems to brighten the light silver and darken the darker grey. At least that's what it seems like. No frizzies either and that's important for me.<br />I used Great Clips brand before trying this, and while I really liked what Great Clips Purple shampoo did for my hair, I prefer this brand.

4.0,Well this is fun,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this product, but it is really fun. Who thought that pink eyelashes would look great?<br />I am not a make up expert and I don't think I am that good at it either, so I have no problem admitting that MY end result did not look like the pictures. And I will also admit that this may be my fault.<br />The pictures show eyelashes that look solidly pink (or whatever colour you buy); mine did not come out like that. The brush tends to carry a lot of mascara so I got some clumping.<br />My eyelashes, which are black, ended up pinkish over the black near the base but with pink tips and I actually think it looks better than the professional pics. The only way I could get solid pink eyelashes ended up with too much clumping. So it was possible to get solid pink eyelashes and I did, but then I had to gently wipe off all the excess mascara and that left me with pink tips.<br />Honestly, I liked it that way, I think it looks more subtle and not so obvious. The pink mascara goes great with mauve or nude eyeshadow IMO.<br />This needed a couple of minutes to dry but after that it didn't smudge. And it really does lengthen and thicken lashes.

3.0,not that strong,This is a fairly weak retinol formula. I have several on my shelf and I can tell from using them which ones are stronger.

4.0,Moisturizes nicely,"This cream is very moisturizing. It feels a bit decadent to be honest. It's a light green and not quite as cucumber-y as I would like.

4.0,A new experience,I've never quite tried anything like this. The cleanser is a light green gel--almost slime but not slimy.

4.0,Good clay mask,"I liked this clay mask a lot. The mask cream is very thick indeed, and it takes a squeeze to get it out of the tube. It goes a long way, but at the same time, this is a small tube (3 oz). It dries quickly. And it's the type of mask that makes your face feel TIGHT. The type where you can't smile.<br />After about 20 mins, I washed this off. It was easy to remove. After using a few times, I think it does indeed have a brightening effect on the skin. It doesn't moisturize. At least it didn't for me, and I had to lather on cream afterwards as my skin felt a bit dry after the mask.<br />Overall I liked this. I like how it worked but it is on the pricey side.",[],B07M9D3WYW,B07M9D3WYW,AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,1596398540944,0,False
2.0,Nifty idea but I'd worry about it holding mask in place,"What's that saying about necessity being the mother of invention? Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br /><br />This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br />I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br /><br />I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br /><br />One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br /><br />I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material. A sort of light grey merle, but if you are looking at this for long-term safety, I would say no.",[],B088FBNQXW,B088FBNQXW,AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,1594835672084,0,False

4.0,"Great for almost everything, except ears","The cotton on these swabs is layered thinner and firmer than other cotton swabs I've tried. This makes them less than ideal for cleaning delicate parts of the human body, like ears.<br /><br />However, they are excellent for everything else. If you're doing detail cleaning, these swabs are a total bargain. If you need cotton swabs for a high heat situation (where plastic just won't do), these are more than adequate.

The shave was also not as close as before. I oiled them regularly and followed the instructions.  After about a week of daily use I gave up and just ordered new Phillips blades.

My only real complaint is that they don't really fizz or bubble to the extent that many other bath bombs do, but I was prepared for that when I placed my order because I had read quite a few reviews on these already.<br /><br />The scent is sort of hit or miss depending on which bomb you're using. Overall they could all stand to be a bit stronger than they are.<br /><br />The saving grace for this product is that they make my skin feel super soft! Which I love.<br /><br />The botanical pieces don't really bother me the way it seems to bother a lot of other people apparently. Yes, if you purchase these your bathtub may require a bit of cleanup if the pieces don't wash completely down the drain after your bath. Be prepared. This is a natural product, so you're going to get bits and pieces of the plants that were used in their creation. I personally enjoy that.<br /><br />Would I purchase these again? Meh.

But when I opened the package, I was surprised by the shiny soft and slick surface, and it has me a bit concerned. Normal cowhide leather will naturally scuff over time, especially with travel and frequent use, but I am not sure yet whether this material will scratch or perhaps even tear after a while, or worse: start to get that sticky feel to it as the material’s composition breaks down. It feels more like soft plastic than leather, and it does not smell bad. Overall I am pleased with the design and features of this bag and plan to keep it.

3.0,I have fine hair but a lot of it,"I’ve had numerous extensions in my life. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Bellami volumizing weft, which is expensive (definitely an investment). I have fine hair but a lot of it. The problem I have with many extension companies is blending the extensions with my own hair, since most of them are so thin my hair peaks through. I also have shoulder length hair, which adds another level of difficulty when trying to blend extensions.<br /><br />Pros<br />• The hair is soft<br />• The hair doesn’t tangle easily<br />• The color is nice<br />• The clips are amazing. Once I clip them in they stay.<br />• They are convenient. One weft and you’re done (usually)<br />• They are cheap, and a good quality for the price<br />• Good starting off extensions<br /><br />Cons<br />• The hair is thin; it is heavier on top and thins out to a v-point. As expected my hair peaked though. I ended up tying up my bottom layer and  putting the extensions on top. It solved the problem of the hair poking though.<br />• For these extensions to work for me I would need to buy at least two more packs of hair. Having 3, five clip wefts wouldn’t fit around my head comfortably.<br />• These will not give you volume; they are too thin to give you any thickness<br />• If you have a lot of hair these will not look very natural<br /><br />This hair is best suited for someone with thin, medium length hair who is looking for some length. Also, if you have layers in your hair it could help blend the hair. I got my own hair thinned out a little at the hair salon and it made a huge difference.<br /><br />This hair will not work well with short hair or thick hair unless you are willing to work hard to blend it.<br /><br />I will be buying one more weft in order to see how that works out for me. I will update this post once I receive my new weft.<br /><br />My experience wearing 2- five clip wefts",[],B01H3BXLXG,B01H3BXLXG,AHV4TTK5BQLDT6KTDLE3ASUSWG2A,1486920560000,8,True

Now,  I wish it was thinner so it is easier to blend in the corner of the nose.  Over all,  I am happy.  Saves on foundation and no more messy old make up sponges. I honestly think those old ones hold a lot germs and they can get hard quickly from letting foundation sit on them without washing out after each use and even when you do wash them,  it never seems to completely get it all out.

They're nicely sized and amply thick so the various textures on top are substantial enough for cleaning brushes. Each one has four suction cups on the back and they actually stick extremely well. It's a little tricky lining them all up so that these stay perfectly flat but it's doable. The colors of the bunnies are true to the product pictures so I disagree the green one could classify as mint. It's really more of a dark teal, but I still it.<br /><br />This set comes with four makeup sponges. I don't often use those so I'm no expert but these seem a little cheap to me as they came with some dents in them. I also didn't get the colors pictured and wasn't aware they would be random.

5.0,Very happy with this razor,"I am very impressed with this razor. I have used electric razors most of my 35+ years of shaving. I was skeptical using it for the first time, I thought it wasn't working because it is so soft to the face and so quiet. It didn't sound ""agressive"" like my other razors did. WRONG!!! The shave was close, my skin was not irritated at all, and it cut smooth basically in the first pass. This unit is first class.<br /><br />My previous razor was a Braun foil. I bought one for myself and another for my son from Frys because of the price. JUNK!!! We both have heavy beards, he more so than I, and both of us had terrible 5 o'clock shadows by 10:00AM! And the skin irritation on my neck, just horrible.<br /><br />I took a long time comparing all the available models. For me this model provides the best mix of features and price. I definitely recommend the Speed-XL shaving heads. Other nice features are it can be cleaned under the faucet, it charges quickly and maintains that charge for a long time, and it provides what I consider one of the best shaves I've had in a long time. The heft and feel is good. Materials are good. Workmanship is good. The only feature I'd like to have is a battery charge indicator.<br /><br />The other Speed-XL model is the 8160. It includes the cleaning system with a much higher price. Now there is the SmartTouch-XL which may be overkill. But if price is not an issue...<br /><br />May, 2012 - I can't believe I wrote the original review almost seven years ago. I'm still using this razor and it still works just as I expressed back then. The battery still keeps a great charge, and the shave is still excellant. I went on a 10 day vacation last year and the charge held for the whole trip.

5.0,Really nice spray bottle,"Really nice spray bottle. I have three of these and I keep alcohol in them for sanitizing. The trigger sprayer is easy on my hand the size is great and I am going to make a label one day if it kills me with my old LabelMaker that says alcohol. I use isopropyl alcohol for everything. Before Covid when my husband will go to sleep I would spray the whole floor the door knobs, and the chairs. I didn’t want him to get sick. And he didn’t and neither did I. I think preventative spraying with alcohol is a good way to not get sick. If you have a nice spray bottle you can spray the floor in the bathroom, the kitchen floor, the door knobs, and you can wash the surface with a glass covering like my kitchen table. It’s hard to find a good spray bottle and these work well plus they’re very very pretty. They’re a blue green. Very cheery and well-made. If you get about 3 You will always know alcohol and you won’t even have to label them. You can have them in different parts of your house. That will be your visual go to alcohol station. I color coordinate everything. I read books on neuroscience and the more organized you are the less your brain stresses. So when I see green I know it’s a big fat spray bottle with alcohol. I buy alcohol by the gallon and just fill them. Hope this helps somebody",[],B0899CQXL7,B0899CQXL7,AG3R4737XHEGWCX3A54EBFTPE4TA,1618681480932,0,True

4.0,💕💃Retire that old blow dryer and brush💕,"WOW!! When I first recieved this I was really intimidated. Its HUGE! I was worried about even being able to use it. But I'm always up for a challenge.<br />First let me say I have fine but thick hair and shoulder length. Normally I use a blow dryer and a circular brush to give myself some volume.<br />This unit comes with 2 brushes, one for shorter hair,one for longer. The brushes have nice soft bristles that won't rip at your hair. So if you do get a tangle it slides right out. I used the shorter brush myself.<br />At first it was difficult for me to use because of a bad shoulder. The size was an issue for me. But with a little practice I got the hang of it. Realizing that it actually takes the place of 2 tools. The blow dryer and circular brush all in one ( still old school I guess 🙃)  And in the long run I found it easier on my bad shoulder because I had to use only one tool instead of two! 💃<br />I also takes some real practice to use the rolling feature. If there was anything I would change, that would be it. There is one for this. And it's very easy to accidentally go the wrong way (😜 believe me not a good look)<br />Once I figured out to just roll it enough to get the hair on and let go of the button, hold it for a moment while the dryer works then pull it through. And WOW it gives you such volume that lasts all day. Leaves your soft and silky too. I'm so impressed!<br />I immediately made the room for this new tool in my bathroom.<br />I would highly recommend it. It's a little intimidating.. So worth the challenge tho!<br />I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried it... You should too! Sometimes new products are a real improvement on the old standbys.👍<br /><br />If you found this review helpful could you please pop 👆 the button below👇<br />Happy Shopping😊","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qCmwCc5bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qCmwCc5bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qCmwCc5bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07PPLGRM2,B07PPLGRM2,AFZXNETV655OT5NR6AD4MMIQLKXQ,1568725293374,8,False

It feels like plastic.<br /><br />The curve does not match the curvature of the RX100. There's a very slight gap between body and handgrip. I will admit it is possible that I didn't position it precisely, though I made a great effort to do so.<br /><br />I would have preferred a deeper inset, but that's a stylistic thing.<br /><br />The part on the fron of the camera doesn't run all the way to the lens mount. That leaves a gap between the edge of the handgrip and the lens mount that feels odd to my fingertips when holding the camera.<br /><br />I really don't care for the surprise bonus: the name and model number of the item are printed on the front of the handgrip. That ugly surprise is nowhere to be seen on the nine photos of the product on the Amazon sales page. There is absolutely no practical reason for this to be there.<br /><br />I'm going to try to return.
