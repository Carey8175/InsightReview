5.0,Great for the price.,"Bought it for a costume. Super easy to flat iron or even get it a slight wave. Which i recommend because it does come in a plastic bag so the hairs will be dented and bent not flat like in the pictures. Just use low heat. So easy on the brushing as the hairs will come out in small chunks. Does have bangs but I just tucked them off to the side. For the price, it was great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VObpjz+LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VObpjz+LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VObpjz+LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sSwutPLRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sSwutPLRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sSwutPLRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074J6NN1Z,B074J6NN1Z,AG3VZ2NAIVQF5PBSZZF2FA6DUJFQ,1582082838227,0,True

5.0,"Work great for fine, thin hair","I have long, very fine, very thin hair so getting volume is always a problem for me. The only way I could get any sort of volume was to go the salon and get a blow out which, for obvious financial reasons, I can't do every day. I had a list of requitements for a round brush and this set checks every box!<br />They are sturdy and won't fall apart like the cheap ones you get at the big box stores. The hollow barrel is ceramic coated for better heat conduction without the extra damage to your hair you get from a metal barrel. The bristles are plastic but flexible and keep your hair smooth amd shiney. As a fun bonus, I adore the color! The set of 3 give you 1-1/4&#34;, 1-3/4&#34; and 2&#34; sizes. It also comes in an aesthetically pleasing box that is perfect for wrapping if this is intended as a gift.<br />If you don't know how to use a round brush I suggest looking up some tips. I was making it much harder than it needed to be! Biggest tip, don't try to do a blowout on wet hair! Your hair should be damp at best, like 80% dry. Otherwise it becomes a tangled disaster.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61frgNR7OdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61frgNR7OdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61frgNR7OdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+UDXdDwpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+UDXdDwpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+UDXdDwpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dio8-bnJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dio8-bnJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dio8-bnJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k-rrDMWbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k-rrDMWbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k-rrDMWbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w48oSYu8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w48oSYu8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71w48oSYu8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01NCKZW20,B01NCKZW20,AE6X4BTWYBBOQDRWANJLNHMR44UQ,1522288026760,4,False
5.0,"Nice set for gifting, lack a bit compared to name brand bath bombs","Let me start out by saying that I'm a bath product snob. Now that you know that about me, let's get into the review.<br />I love the way these bath bombs are packaged. They come in a nice shrink wrapped box that is perfect for gifting. Inside, each bath bomb is individually shrink wrapped and has a paper wrapping inside of that as well. Each is labeled with its scent. I loved the vanilla scent.<br />I like that each bath bomb contains essential oils to enhance its purpose.<br />Now, here's when my snobiness comes through. Hope te bath bombs smelled great, once you drop it into the water the smell is short lived at best. Also the fizz is a bit disappointing. With my other (more expensive) bath bombs, they fizz like crazy.<br />All in all, these are great but just don't expect the high dollar bath bomb experience.",[],B01G45HX18,B01G45HX18,AE6X4BTWYBBOQDRWANJLNHMR44UQ,1479623588000,1,True

5.0,Easy to Use,"I use coconut oil on a daily basis and one of the main ways I use it is as lotion. The downside of using coconut oil as lotion is that usually you have to dig and scrape at it and then warm the hard oil in your hands to melt it before you can apply it. That problem is now extinct with this fractionated coconut oil! Just pump it out and apply! And one pump goes a long ways!<br />This form of coconut oil also comes in very handy when giving massages. When before, if I wanted to use coconut oil for a massage, I would have to heat up some in order to melt it, now I can just pump some from this bottle! This is especially convenient when I have to go elsewhere to give a massage and I don't have any means to heat my oil.<br />I'm glad that I have this fractionated coconut oil, it has made life a bit easier, especially when I am in a hurry. I do still use my regular coconut oil now and again, but for convenience sake I find myself using this product more and more often.<br /> I hope my review was somewhat helpful for you!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fvWtfs5WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fvWtfs5WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fvWtfs5WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01I2MU2JQ,B01I2MU2JQ,AESBYJBM5ORAARLHA6VHAJ5DNHGA,1476074897000,0,False

I don't use a lot as I don't want to clog any pipes or have it build up anywhere, but I have researched it and a little bit is just fine to use.  Talk about relaxing!  Sitting in the hot tub under the starry night with the jets on and all the steam rising off the water smells of lavender.  Put a glass of wine in my hand and that's what I call a perfect night!<br /> I cannot testify that it makes me sleep better because I have an infant son that is doing his best to keep me from sleeping.  But it is a very relaxing essential oil to use.  Helps calm me down when I am super stressed out.

3.0,"Works well, but frustrating lack of documentation","Local laws seem to vary regarding the use of shavers by pedicurists. Some places allow them, others don't. Since foot calluses are always an issue for me, a regular pedicure has long been necessary and I prefer places that use a shaver. But this gadget lets me take care of calluses myself quickly and easily, after a shower when my skin is soft. It works like a charm. However, there are no instructions and it will take you a little time to figure out how to use the shaver, how to use the rasp, and how to remove the blades (which need to be removed and cleaned after each use). This is a big negative. If the manufacturer added an instruction booklet with some diagrams then this would be a five star product.

4.0,"Good features for medium duty requirements, but 7xxx series might be a better value","I've owned this for a year and am quite pleased with it.  But, if I were to buy again, I would probably go with the lower-cost 7xxx series.  There are a few more features on the 8140XL -- the charging stand and full charge LED -- but basically Norelco makes a decent electric shaver.  Upsides:<br />1) One significant benefit is the LONG time before the battery needs to be recharged -- perhaps a combination of using a good battery and low power requirements. I have taken it on a week-long business trip without bringing the charger.<br />Downsides:<br />1) $45 for a set of replacement blades is high. However, after a year, the original blade set is still adequate.<br />2) A ""needs charging"" LED would be useful.<br />Note that my shaver gets relatively light usage -- my beard is not overly thick, and I use a Gillette blade after not shaving over the weekend -- a blade gives a much quicker and better shave on a couple days' growth.

DON'T buy these if your looking for the original, robust, heavy, rough Salux cloths. For $12 bucks, no big deal, but this has taught me a sad lesson. Amazon descriptions can't be trusted, and buying from an Amazon merchant is no guarantee of quality or truthfulness in product descriptions. FYI, on edit, the merchant selling and shipping these on my purchase was Toys & Games, Etc., SCS Collectibles, Inc. Other sellers through Amazon may be more honest in their descriptions of these Salux cloths. I won't know, I guess, until I receive the ones I ordered through Amazon from a different merchant.

Amazing!!!,"Just bought my 2nd pack of 3 tubes so I won’t run out anytime soon… this is a MIRACLE product for severely chapped lips, and it’s safe for sensitive skin!<br /><br />I have rosacea, and my skin is extremely sensitive. I’ve had to stop wearing cosmetics, and my skin routine has felt like a part time job. I also have several allergies, and the antihistamines I have to take make my skin/lips even more dry. I’ve apparently become overly sensitized to ingredients in 95%+ of commercial lip balm products, “natural” ingredients/products. No matter how much water I drink, very healthy diet, hyaluronic acid supplements & topical hyaluronic acid + occlusives, running a humidifier, staying indoors, etc., nothing has helped the severe, painful peeling of my lips for the past 3-4 years. It’s been embarrassing and has made talking, eating and drinking an uncomfortable and painful.<br /><br />Everything I tried seemed to make this even worse, so I eventually gave up on lip balm. I tried “nothing,” (just to see if I actually needed lip balm- that was a mistake!). I resorted to trying single ingredient options, just to help identify what the problem ingredient might be: testing by applying only straight argan, olive, safflower or squalane oils (messy, shiny, and doesn’t last without an occlusive layer added on top), straight manuka honey (messy, sticky, expensive and only made me want to lick my lips all day lol). Made my own manuka honey, argan oil and beeswax product (worked pretty well but oh so messy, time consuming to make).<br /><br />Finally gave up on that and was only able to use Vanicream ointment (dermatologist recommended and similar to Vaseline but without the petrochemical odor- I can’t use products like Vaseline or Aquaphor FWIW). But even that wasn’t working well because i needed to be SO careful not to apply too much, or the ointment would eventually  migrate onto my face (usually while sleeping), which would cause rosacea flares (heavy occlusives seal in moisture but can also trap in just enough heat to cause a rosacea flare).<br /><br />But that messy solution that only stopped **some** of the peeling temporarily, and never resolved the issue entirely. Even applying every hour on the hour didn’t make much of a difference. My lips were still chapped feeling/peeling every day, just slightly less chapped.<br /><br />But THIS STUFF IS WHAT ALL LIP BALMS ARE MEANT TO BE! I am not exaggerating when I say that within an hour or so after applying this for the first time, I noticed my lips didn’t feel rough any longer… for the first time in YEARS!!! Weird, right?!! I didn’t believe it could be possible at first, but it’s truly  like I’ve never had chapped, peeling lips. Miracle in a tube!<br /><br />This must be what Goldilocks looks for when her lips are chapped: It doesn’t burn. It doesn’t sting. It doesn’t taste weird. It’s not too shiny or greasy feeling. It just makes my lips feel smooth and soft. You can faintly taste the elderberry/manuka honey when applying but it doesn’t linger. It’s not overpowering or flavorful enough to make you inadvertently lick your lips, which I always seem to do with “yummy” lip balm products.<br /><br />It just works. My grad school student son also loves it for the same reasons. It just makes your lips feel and look like lips are supposed to feel and look like. It’s long lasting, and when it does eventually lwear off, you won’t get that “rebound dryness” you might get from products like Eos, Chap-Stick and Burt’s Bees. It’s just SO perfect!!!",[],B07PM8PFC8,B07PM8PFC8,AG3APOWLBC4YMSTRKT54HS3GYKPQ,1645288802524,0,True
5.0,Yum!!! Key lime is so good! Best lip balm ever!,"I’ve been using Savannah Bee Co. Tupelo Honey lip balm for a while and it’s the BEST I’ve ever used! But it’s hard for me to find locally, so this was a score! My lips have always gotten severely chapped no matter how much water I drink, no matter what I do. I take medications that make my mouth and skin feel dry, so fighting chapped lips is  a never-ending battle. I’m never without at least one tube of lip balm within arm’s reach!<br />I’ve used almost every non-petroleum based “premium” lip balm out there, and I’ve tried coconut oil, Shea butter, lanolin, you name it. I’ve been settling for Burt’s Bees and Dr. Bronners, both of which feel pretty good but don’t seem to last very long.<br />This is the first lip balm I’ve tried in 40+ years that seems to actually work! It goes on much more smoothly, tastes *really* good but isn’t overpowering at all, and actually helps keep my lips soft! Finally!!!<br />For anyone wondering, the key lime flavor is really good! I’d never tried it before, but since I love key lime pie, I took a chance. It really does taste like key lime! Not overpowering or artificial tasting and seems to work just as well as the Tupelo honey flavor.<br />The seller shipped this quickly, and with a nice personal touch. Thank you so much!

I saw this next to another brand and it was a bigger size for the same price, so I decided to give it a try.  I really love this lip balm.  I live in Florida so the sun (especially in summer time) can blister my lips if they aren't protected.  I also get really chapped lips in the winter from the dry air, so I basically use lip balm year round.  The lip balm goes on silky smooth and smells amazing.  I don't know if it is flavored because I avoid licking my lips, because that just chaps them more and makes the situation worse. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a pain to get the stick to move up when you twist the bottom.  You kind of have to fumble with it for a minute or two and put forth more effort then you need to. Other than that, I love it and have purchased the vanilla chai for my purse and the pomegranate for my desk at work.

4.0,Perfect for my curly hair!,"A silk pillowcase isn't enough when you live in a dry climate with curly hair that is prone to frizz. It's exposed to the elements, with minimal protection. Regardless of the product you use, there are still a million other things a woman must contend with such as hormones, aging, etc., that don't help. I notice a huge difference with my hair when sleeping with a satin cap.<br /><br />I definitely recommend for medium-thick, mid-length hair. After trying several caps, this is the best quality thus far. I love the size, and after several washes, the material is intact, and the caps still feel silky. I wash these in either the hand wash or delicate cycle in cold water in my machine. Hang dry.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />- The band of the cap around my head is slightly large, so wearing it as it doesn't work for me.<br />- I sleep with a sleep mask. The mask will press the lining of the band against my forehead, creating a god awful line that will last a good majority of the day.<br /><br />Solution:<br />- Roll up the band once or twice. This prevents lines from forming on my forehead, and the cap stays in place much better.",[],B08DTP8QWL,B08DTP8QWL,AFTL3T5YLY7QIRYO2FMQDKUWE3WQ,1634070623141,0,True

5.0,Complex Soap... Don't Overlook This!!!!!,"This soaps ingredients are varied, but they work together to create a unique soap! The patchouli scent is there, but it doesn't smell like a busload of hippies just past by. The charcoal seems to help keep the scent in check. So what you end up with is a nice musky, woodsy smell that isn't overpowering.<br /><br />When opening the package, a little moisture control packet was included with it... you know, those little &#34;do not eat&#34; things. Also, this is a large bar of soap! This was a really fresh piece of soap as it was practically starting to melt in my hand. I actually let this sit out on a metal rack for about 3 weeks to cure. Again, this is a huge piece of soap so after that drying period, I cut it in half for use. The charcoal has little scrubby bits in it, but they don't hurt my sensitive skin. Also, the soap itself is rather mild so it doesn't make my skin break out either. This melts slowly, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck. It cleans your skin nicely and also leaves you feeling moisturized. After showering, the smell gets a little bit sweeter, definitely not candy sweet, but a little lighter, softer and stays on you for a while afterwards.<br /><br />This is a great piece of soap if you like outdoor, woodsy, earthy kinda scents. If you're looking for candy sweet or citrus, you will be severely disappointed.<br /><br />FYI: When I bought this a few months ago, the name of this product was &#34;Patchouli Charcoal&#34; but this is the link along with this product so I believe that they just changed the name of the product :) Also, I didn't get ANY type of deal on this for my review...

This creme smells divine! I normally don’t like a scented skincare product but I do when it’s this good! It’s a thicker creme but not heavy. A little bit goes a long way. You put it on at night and your skin drinks it in. You can almost feel your skin getting softer if that makes sense. By morning, my skin feels and looks fresher, brighter, hydrated and alive! This is a sample size from Sephora but I am sold on this product and I WILL be getting the full size!! I love that it’s a once a day creme too so it will last that much longer.

5.0,Love this color!!!,"Finally, the right color for me.  I had searched forever to find the right color, and here it is.  I noticed that some reviewers were not pleased with the glimmersticks gooey consistency.  What I do to reduce the pliability so I can dry etch the color onto my eyebrow is I allow the stick to dry out a bit by removing the cap for a day.  This way it is not quite so sticky and gooey, and more like a crayon consistency that etches very nicely onto my brow without leaving tiny particles or gooey globs.  They also hold up longer this way and the tip remains sharp as well instead of rounding out.  Otherwise if the stick is right out of the wrapper I have to be extremely cautious about applying too much or making it look 'clownish' and less natural.  These sticks can also be used as eye liners if they are not allowed to dry out a bit because they are so pliable.  But I do adore this perfect color for my blonde hair and accents, so I simply dry them for a day, then use them like an eyebrow pencil that doesn't glob or goo on, and I'm a happy camper!

This absolutely works for that. It also helps to reduce oil without drying. That's a problem I've encountered with some masks. They reduce oil at the expense of my skin getting flaky.

I just put it on the nails of my left hand and gave it about 8 to 10 minutes. Then I used polish remover to get rid of the blue gel. You do need a metal cuticle pusher to scrape off the rest of the polish. I will probably use this before I go to the salon (if we ever get to do that again!), just to save the time of the foil wraps.

5.0,Licensed Cosmetologist review!,These are so so easy to fan out for volume lashes!! Since I got these I’ve ordered 2 more cases of this brand. They make making fans seriously SO MUCH easier!! I’ve used so many different brands and they either don’t fan well or bend or lose shape. These are absolutely perfect. They don’t lose shape from the tweezers at all or crimp like some cheap brands do! I absolutely love these so much and highly highly recommended trying these even if you are new to volume lashing like me. This order was for the 13mm and I ordered the like 16-22 I think and the 8-13 I think or something like that so that I have every size this brand has I wanted to stock up before everyone else sees how good they are and stocks up too lol.,[],B09FDTDK3G,B09FDTDK3G,AELRWE7QQJRKDFHDQHVAODTF5FRA,1640571872308,0,False
5.0,SOFT!,"These are so soft and I absolutely love them!  I have maybe 10+ different brands of lashes because I'm looking to find my favorite brand to use on my clients. These are the softest lashes I've used this far!! There doesn't seem to be like a super full amount on each line but that will make them easier to make volume lash fans with for sure! They are seriously so soft you guys! I seriously love these! I got the 8mm-15mm lengths in black then one row of blonde brown color, red and one row of blue the colored lashes are all in 12mm which is perfect! The case is unique too, I like that it is magnetic closure that is unique and it's a neat design too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BzRTlJXCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BzRTlJXCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BzRTlJXCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NftUBVw9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NftUBVw9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NftUBVw9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812J8xFmcuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812J8xFmcuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812J8xFmcuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Jw1xzJ-sL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Jw1xzJ-sL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Jw1xzJ-sL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RnVTtbNML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RnVTtbNML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RnVTtbNML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SjZyC5ebL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SjZyC5ebL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SjZyC5ebL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VFvJ68EgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VFvJ68EgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VFvJ68EgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B099F97414,B099F97414,AELRWE7QQJRKDFHDQHVAODTF5FRA,1635386902719,0,False
3.0,So cute and I love the pink stripe,I have worn so many different hair extensions or wigs and love them. This does have a fake hair kind of shine and it does shed quiet a bit. It is so cute and not easily tangled either. It's shorter in the back and a little longer in the front. The cap is a little on the more snug side. This has a really nice and pretty wave to it that makes it look a little more natural in my opinion. It's seriously so cute and unique it comes with 2 really nice wig caps and a barrette too and a seriously such cute earrings.

3.0,Nice but thin,The hair is a very nice quality and it is the length expected but it is so thin and the tracks are so bulky. I'm so bummed they're so thin because my hair is so thick. They are all 3 individually wrapped bundles and tell you the length on them. The track part is super thick but the very ends just thin out sooo much. I guess that is how natural hair is so I will give it a try. I'm going to do a hand tied weft and will update after I wear them and let you guys know how they dry too. I have naturally curly hair so I always prefer hair that dried kinda wavy like my own and nobody ever says in the reviews that and I'm sure other people wanted to know too!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pOusLjIfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pOusLjIfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pOusLjIfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-dzytkfXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-dzytkfXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-dzytkfXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KFsey6G9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KFsey6G9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KFsey6G9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qjb7jTo+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qjb7jTo+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Qjb7jTo+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QtCr3NEgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QtCr3NEgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QtCr3NEgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RUgK51DyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RUgK51DyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RUgK51DyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ykQBhC6NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ykQBhC6NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ykQBhC6NL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085RS26YH,B085RS26YH,AELRWE7QQJRKDFHDQHVAODTF5FRA,1628641370785,0,False

5.0,Good buy- Licensed pro going on 11 years!,"First of all this case is nice and worth the listed price on it's own! I have like 15 pairs of scissors and they're all dull so I figured I'd give these a try! I'm soo glad I did, I have nothing I dislike or don't love and I always have something I dislike usually lol. These have cute little blue gems and are really sharp and do a great job they're comfortable for my little hands and my chubby fingers! So excited to use them at work tommorrow!!!

2.0,"""Sea"" Mist is a Misnomer","*Sigh*<br />This product received rave reviews, so I was very excited to purchase and test it out.<br />My hair is naturally very wavy. If the wave doesn't have product, it isn't tame. So, most mornings I dry/straighten it to avoid looking like a wild banshee at work.<br />However, I recently moved to Florida and because of the humidity, my waves are being a bit more cooperative. That being said, a product like this that would help hold the wave throughout the day and tame the &#34;wildness&#34; is desirable. Unfortunately, this has not worked for me as it is advertised.<br />There isn't enough salt to hold the hair in place. Instead of a subtle stiffness to hold the 'beach wave', my hair appeared a droopy, greasy mess that looks like I'd slept in a frying pan (with leftover bacon grease) rather than the just-off-the-surf look that I was anticipating.<br />Everyone's hair is different, so perhaps this product works better for others. My hair is long and thick. I would think that this may work better for people with shorter hair where gravity isn't fighting with the product all day.<br />Okay, so why did I give this more than one star? IT SMELLS AMAZING! If anything, I'll be using this as a perfume rather than a hair product. Seriously, I can't get enough of the coconutty wonderfulness in the bottle.",[],B015RR870U,B015RR870U,AE2PNM7Q4423U2ZEKETUSAYC3NXA,1493901686000,4,True

So, I ran across this product and decided to give it a go since it is an item I would use almost every day.<br />I'm impressed with this product thus far (I've been using it for about a week).<br />The pros:<br />- Fast (I'm not a morning person, so anything to speed up that process is welcome)<br />- Sleek and stylish design (it just looks cool)<br />- Efficient and does the job it is advertised to do<br />- You don't have to use styling product (It's advertised that the build of this product protects the hair, so you can pitch your gels/goos)<br /><br />The con (and this isn't much of a con):<br />- You can't just 'brush' your hair, you do need to hold the hair out straight and comb it through. This doesn't really bother me, but I guess it could bother some people.<br /><br />Overall, great buy!",[],B01G1F7HAS,B01G1F7HAS,AE2PNM7Q4423U2ZEKETUSAYC3NXA,1493295338000,7,True

5.0,Excellent product!,"When I first used this shaver there were a few things I had to learn.  It's quiet -- so quiet, I thought it wasn't working properly.  Second, you don't have to press hard to get it to work -- just keep passing it over any area of your skin requiring extra attention and it will do the job.  Third, the lotion/gel samples make the shave live up to its name of Cool Skin -- no razor burn whatsoever.<br /><br />I have two issues with the shaver.  First, Norelco still has one of the most inconvenient methods of cleaning I've ever seen.  Every few days you need to disassemble the blades from the discs holding them and using a brush (I use an old toothbrush) to get the old hair out of there.  Rinsing it under water doesn't do anything but remove the stray hair stubble in the head itself.<br /><br />Second, the refills are difficult to find.  They are relatively expensive in most sources (including here at Amazon) but are available at the world's largest retailer in a box of 5 for $4.94.  I find they last about 10 days if you don't go crazy pressing the button for lotion.  I also find the lotion much better than the gel.

4.0,Great purchase.,"These work with or without products.  I have used them on damp hair, and completely dry.  They do not include directions so you have to go online and watch videos on how to use them properly.  The way you hook your hair will depend on if it goes in to the curler properly.  These are not comfortable to sleep in.  Also sleeping in them does not affect the outcome of the curls.  They are very springy.  I have a little over shoulder length hair, and these are way too long.  My hair doesn't fill half of the length of the curler.  Do not use large amounts of hair in each, or you will not get defined curls.  Smaller portions work really well for defined curls. This is time consuming, so get ready to spend some time doing this.  The more you do it though, the faster you will get at it. Loading the curlers, and sectioning the hair is what takes the most time.",[],B08GKV2WY6,B08GKV2WY6,AEUDRDR2NCMNDDBNJTDALPP65UHA,1614983071140,0,True

5.0,Amazing for sensitive skin,"I had quite a few people tell me how fantastic this soap is. I am a complete skeptic when it comes to anything that goes on your face. I have the most sensitive skin, everything irritates and burns immediately only to be followed by breakouts. I have used this product for a week now, and LOVE IT! It removes my make up quickly, I swipe once and its gone. It doesn't dry out your skin, but leaves you feeling fresh. I have used it once as a body wash, and it worked great. I also read where you can wash your hair with it, I have tried it once and it left my hair a little dry and to be honest weird feeling. I listed to the review by Renee that suggested cutting this soap bar into much smaller pieces. I probably have 80 pieces all together now, that way your not having to wet the entire soap bar, and you cut down on the waste. I placed them in a sandwich bag (that barely closes). I think this one bar will last me 4 months just washing my face. I am ecstatic, this product could not come at a better time since estee lauder just changed their ingredients and now their make up remover irritates me. Definitely will buy again!!",[],B00YI9XO8Y,B00YI9XO8Y,AEZP5WLOCUSXF7RYGHJDRDGAGH4A,1441828320000,1,True

5.0,As close as I have found to my original from the 1990's,"I've only had for a few weeks so can't speak to durability but these are the closest match to the size and type I was looking for. I took great lengths with this review since I had such a difficult time finding what I needed. Hope to spare someone else the grief. They are not micro which was too small, true to size 1cm wide and approximately 1.5 cm long.<br /> So far they are holding well (I have long thick hair with bangs). I had one left from a set bought probably 20 years ago which were obviously good quality. They are nearly identical except these do allow for a better grip for your fingers which has to be a feat for such a small clip. Plus I have arthritis in my thumbs, it makes a difference.  These are of a different plastic maybe less durable but it's not that thin brittle type plastic. I'm adding pictures to compare. My original is on the left side. So yes I'm pleased with how these clips are designed and if they hold up for longer than 9 months that would be nice.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619q4N9zACL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619q4N9zACL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619q4N9zACL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-X1E2krpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-X1E2krpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-X1E2krpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J+qx3EHFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J+qx3EHFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J+qx3EHFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QbsFXBooL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QbsFXBooL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QbsFXBooL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uy1v7WV8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uy1v7WV8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uy1v7WV8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07PZ5SWKG,B07PZ5SWKG,AGX2LTWHJVTABM4WHDLSPSZQ3SFA,1579971511193,0,True

Fantastic Face AND Eye Cream!,"I must confess I was a little bit skeptical as to how well a $12 jar of cream would perform on my fickle and sensitive skin in the dry winter months.  Well, let me tell you... I was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a wonderful, organic moisturizer that easily rivals high-end department store creams.  It has a deceptively &#34;light&#34; consistency that is easily absorbed into the skin.  However, once absorbed into the skin... It really outperform itself.  My temperamental skin stayed moisturized the whole day without the need for re-application.  As an added BONUS: I discovered this little jar of cream also makes for a phenomenal Eye Cream.  In fact, you won't even need another eye cream at all once you try this stuff.  It moisturizes and hydrates so deeply, you wake up looking fresh-eyed and ready to conquer the day!

4.0,"Unique, smells great, deep tan","This is a unique product that I have not seen previously. It is used basically like a foundation, such that it washes off. This doesn’t have DHA in it, so it’s not a self tanner.<br /><br />However, it actually works surprisingly well. I personally lose my tan completely in winter and am very fair. I know for a fact this will compliment my skin when I have my tan back. It wouldn’t look right on pale skin.<br /><br />The ‘lotion’ is incredibly light weight. It absorbs quick yet it’s simple to spread all over. A little goes a very long way.<br /><br />The color doesn’t have not even the slightest bit orange . The color evenly distributes due to the almost immediate absorbing aspect.<br /><br />The smell. I don’t always love fragrance, but truly I love the smell of this. It’s hard to describe. It smells very feminine- but not powdery or floral.<br /><br />I just took off one star due to the fact that it is quite tan, so it wouldn’t be very easy to pull off on super pale skin.<br /><br />Overall I really love this.",[],B07SV4HTMC,B07SV4HTMC,AELI2OMQ3Q7EREYSTD4A5PLCABAQ,1583448951010,0,False

It lathered well and made my hair feel clean<br />results: I did not use conditioner so that I could really gauge the results. I blow dried my hair per usual and I was really happy with the results. My hair had body and volume, felt very healthy, had some shine, was not oily or dry, and smelled amazing.<br />Day two and my hair still looks and feels great. I would definitely recommend this product. It also makes me feel good using something that has all natural oils and ingredients that I can read and understand.<br />The ONLY bad thing I could say is that my pump is ineffective and doesn't work like it should. however this is not enough to effect the ratings as I just unscrewed it and poured it into my hands. simple fix.<br /><br />I was given this product for free in exchage for an UNBIASED review.

My skin feels just as rough and dry as before. Not to mention that this size was extremely small like about an 2"" high! Definitely not worth the price for this small quantity and poor quality. Also, the cream was not moisturizing.",[],B074WF5KPB,B074WF5KPB,AEGBW32WT525IQF4NTYNJWBU3T7A,1612581728401,0,True

5.0,TARTE IS THE VERY BEST,"I have used ""Tarte Shape Tape Hydrating Foundation"" since it first came out and have loved it. Tarte has done away with the 'Shape Tape Foundation' and has replaced it with..... ""Face Tape Foundation.""<br /><br />I tried the ""Face Tape Foundation"" which is somehow a blend of the 'matte' and the 'hydrating' Shape Tape Foundation formulas.  It didn't do well for me.  It did not seem to cover as well, and it didn't give my skin that airbrushed glow and look.  It was ok, but wasn't superior to other foundations on the market like the Shape Tape Hydrating Foundation was.<br /><br />I am a Baby Boomer and have dry skin that has lines and some wrinkles. The Hydrating Foundation really made my complexion look very good. It has become more and more difficult to find my shade in the Hydrating Formula which is 29B.  Now that I can no longer find it, I decided to try the Shape Tape Matte Formula in shade 29B.<br /><br />I see from other reviews that the Matte Formula can be very drying, settling into pores, wrinkles and lines.  When I wore it, it felt like it literally sucked the moisture right out if my facial skin, leaving it almost painfully dry!!!<br /><br />I have discovered a way to sidestep that and make this look and feel just as nice as the Hydrating Formula.  Under my moisturizer, I apply a thin layer of Argan Oil. Then after a couple of minutes I apply my moisturizer. Then I apply ""Tarte Base Tape PRIMER.""  This primer is amazing and seriously the best I've ever used.  It is amazing how it makes the Matte Formula look and feel as nice as the Hydrating Formula. It leaves your skin feeling so supple and moist, but not oily.<br /><br />I'm thrilled I can still find the Tarte Shape Tape Foundation in my shade, even in the Matte Formula.  With the benefit of argan oil and the superior Tarte Base Tape Primer, the problem has been resolved.<br /><br />I will buy a few more bottles of the Shape Tape Foundation, Matte Formula while I can.  It's the absolute BEST foundation I've ever used.<br />Thank you Tarte!!

I then sectioned my hair and combed it through to the ends with this brush and gently shook the section while holding the end.  Perfect curls as a result, well formed and defined.

I also love essential oil diffusing, but there’s something so sensual and easy about lighting a candle and letting the scent and the light of the flame fill the area. These candles are obviously excellent quality from the wicks and the containers to the actual wax. Lavender is a classic scent and often hard to mess up so I wasn’t worried about that one and it easily met my expectations.<br /> However, balsam fir is actually my most favorite scent (I’m not a floral candle type) and I find that many brands do not meet the true fir scent. This is the most excited I’ve been about a fir scent candle in a long time. I could tell even before lighting it that it was the right match. I’m thinking to keep this set and get another as a gift because I’m so happy with the quality of the candles.

3.0,Ok brush at this price point.,"I noticed some other reviews talking about the brush being dirty when they received it.  Mine didn't seem to be although I did shampoo it once before I used it.  I have a couple other brushes in this price range.  The brush head seems to be the same size and consistency of my other two brushes.  The handle is a little shorter than one (same length as the other) and narrower/thinner than the handle on both my other brushes.  Not horrible but just a little smaller than I was used to.  The first couple times I used the brush it did shed maybe 5-6 bristles each time. But that number dropped off drastically and after a couple weeks of use it might loose a bristle every second or third use.<br />One thing I was happy about was that the complete brush not seems well seated/anchored in the handle.  Every other brush i have bought the whole brush head loosened almost immediately and within a couple weeks came out. So i'd have to break out the Gorilla Glue and repair.  But this brush seems solid.<br />The brush works up a decent lather although it is not as easy or as voluminous a lather as my favorite brush and i'm not sure why.  The brushes seem very similar.  My best guess is the Beau Brummell doesn't seem to retain moisture as well as my other brush.<br />All in all it is a good brush and a great brush for the price.<br />Please note that I received this brush at about an 85% discount with the stipulation that I write a review.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 19, 2015:  So its now been about two months of using this brush about 3-5 times per week.  And lately it has been shedding like crazy.  Every time I use it I end up with 5-10 loose brush hairs stuck in my shave cream jar or on my face.  At this rate it will need rogaine soon.

You can control how cold you get them by how long you leave them in the fridge or let them sit out a bit before using. I think they relieve tension and stress significantly.

4.0,Stunning overall,This tiara is stunning. Even though it’s for play/dress up it’s very attractive. The tiara is mainly a rose gold color on the metal. It has fine detail around the headband of the tiara. Each delicate flower is antique looking. The metal is darkened in areas. The gemstones in the leaves are a light pink/purple color. The other gemstones are other various shades of purple. There’s a deep purple that is almost red and a purple that’s in the middle of the light and dark. The tiara is substantial. It’s not sharp despite looking like it has many sharp pieces to it. I will say a few of the rhinestones that set up on top of the metal decoration were bent. I was able to bend them back ever so slightly. Of course I worry too much bending may break the tiara.<br /><br />It fits well on the head and it is quite comfortable. It’s a attractive tiara and definitely one that’s more for an adult or teen head. I wouldn’t consider something like this for a child.

I would say quality falls into the average lane.  Some of them have more glue visible than others but overall they’ve been done well enough. The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair. Another thing I like about these hairbands is that the set contains a large variety of colors.  Literally any outfit color or style should have a match in this set.",[],B08QHP717Z,B08QHP717Z,AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,1615859778230,0,False

Everything needed from start to finish for little nails is included.<br /><br />There are two cubed nail files and buffers with the frozen nature, Anna, and Elsa printed on them. The nail polishes are very Arendelle<br />colors. Blue, purple, green, yellow, and orange are the main color themes in the set. They are natural and remind us of the elements; trees, water, ice, etc. There is a nail dryer that is in the shade of purple with an Elsa and Ana sticker on the front. It’s a petite size and perfect for little princess hands. I like that the battery case is enclosed with two tiny screws. They are safe and the children are unable to get to them. After the nails have been dried there are various gemstones and stickers that can be used. They are a small size and work for toddler and up. The gemstones are a little bit bigger and a little large on my toddler‘s fingers.  However the size is ideal for a child’s finger nails.<br /><br />My daughter has had so much fun with this kit. There are a ton of options for color. Naturally with so much to choose from, she never wants any one fingernail painted the same.<br /><br />The bottles have all been easy to open and use. They each have a different color as well as a different sticker for the handle of the nail polish. Again, everything is Frozen theme so it’s a huge draw for my little Frozen lover.<br /><br />Also this is a completely gift-able set.

4.0,"Softest soft, not for exfoliating",I have been using a loofah but I feel like I wanted something that could easily reach my entire back without having to be a total contortionist in the shower. A brush with handle seemed like the obvious choice.<br /><br />The first one I bought had bristles on it and it was so hard it hurt to use so I couldn’t even bear the discomfort on my back. That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It’s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it’s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It’s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn’t any exfoliating action. I wouldn’t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It’s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth. This brush is really going to depend on the user and the need. It’s not for exfoliating.,[],B08N9RT9YD,B08N9RT9YD,AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,1612054327215,0,False

As it is a more natural deodorant, it does not glide like the big name brands. It has a slight moisture to it and by warming the deodorant, it slide slightly better.<br /><br />I have noticed that I need to reapply. Depending on my activity level, I have had to reapply two or three times throughout a day. I think the important thing to remember with these natural deodorants is to not expect them to perform like the big name brands.

I think this serum is aiding in my overall skin health.  I found I really need to take the time to work the serum in to get the full benefit otherwise it doesn't seep in too well to do its full effect.  I may gradually wean off to use every other day and cut back further when my skin is in better shape, but I do see myself continuing to use because it really is helping me.

I wish that I had gotten this DMSO last October when I injured my shoulder perhaps I would've save myself from surgery. My sweetheart just use DMSO on our horses and also on himself . He was ready to have knee surgery because he was in intense pain when he started using DMSO on his knee. He did not need the surgery. I told  a coworker  about this because he was going to have knee surgery – – he decided to give it a try and it worked for him. We didn't have the rose aloe formula we just used what we could get from the feed store. It was the liquid  99% pure.  When you use that you need to dilute it with olive oil or something like that.

4.0,"Not amazing, but a nice product.",".<br />I had never used a &#34;bamboo serum&#34; when I ordered this and was curious about it.<br /><br />Predictably, I can't tell that it 'helped supercharge collagen production,' or 'lift sagging skin,' or 'reduce the appearance of age spots' (no serum will do that), but I do like the way it helps firm my skin before I apply makeup. It has a sticky feel coming out of the bottle (mine came with a dropper rather than a pump), and it feels a bit odd going on -- sort of like rubbing mayonnaise into your skin. But then it absorbs well and leaves my skin a bit tighter and smoother. One reviewer has perfectly described the effect as akin to putting on pantyhose -- everything just feels held together nicely.<br /><br />I can't honestly say I will re-order this, because I use a pore refiner that does a better job of leaving my face makeup-ready, and Vitamin C serum seems to leave my skin clearer and nicer. But this works well enough that I finished the bottle.<br /><br />For those who want to use bamboo serum, this one is probably worth a try. Take a look at the wide variance in product pricing.",[],B01N062C2F,B01N062C2F,AEIFO5AJLF3XTOJVUOZAFOJJSDDQ,1485148224000,1,False
5.0,A good product at a good price.,".<br /><br />This Radiance eye cream is a super moisturizer that works well as an overall facial moisturizer, which is how I use it. It goes on and absorbs well, and it's not oily, which makes it great for putting on under makeup.<br /><br />The hyaluronic  acid, aloe vera, and retinol really brighten up the skin and smooth out those pesky little crow's feet.<br /><br />For 1.8 ounces (which comes, by the way, in one of those handy push-down dispensers that you can do with one finger), the price is competitive with those at big box stores.<br /><br />This eye cream is manufactured according to cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) guidelines, which is important to me. The FDA neither reviews nor approves cosmetics products, and the cGMP seal assures that basic manufacturing practices have been met. Also,a cGMP label means that the facility is registered with the FDA.<br /><br />I like this product, and I can highly recommend it.",[],B01HIIT4TE,B01HIIT4TE,AEIFO5AJLF3XTOJVUOZAFOJJSDDQ,1478998667000,0,False
3.0,It's okay.,".<br /><br />Wow, it looks like I'm part of a small minority here! I'm happy that this product works for all the 5- and 4-star reviewers. For me...meh.<br /><br />For starters, this feels greasy on my skin and takes longer than other moisturizers to absorb. Certainly, it is an &#34;okay&#34; moisturizer, hence the three stars. (&#34;It's okay.&#34;) But for me, it's sure nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I very much like the flip-top tube -- very quick and easy to open and dispense with one hand. The texture is nice. And I do appreciate the absence of scent. But an hour after I've applied it, my face feels no different than itI did before I put it on.<br /><br />Having said that, I will say that I have researched the use and effects of ceramide on skin, and it does seem that, in certain strengths and when used with certain other ingredients, ceremides can help skin retain moisture. So, this product will work for some people. It just doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />This product is not overly expensive, which helps, but there are a number of lower-priced moisturizers that I believe most people would find just as good as (or perhaps better than) this one. I can't recommend it as a great moisturizer, and I honestly don't know how it gets such terrific views, but that's the nature of skin care: what works for some doesn't work for others. I just can't see this one as being any kind of a magic bullet.",[],B01GBZT5GM,B01GBZT5GM,AEIFO5AJLF3XTOJVUOZAFOJJSDDQ,1473384703000,3,False
5.0,This is one fine product!,".<br />I ordered this makeup primer because I had been using Eclipse Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple of months and loved what it was doing for my face -- leaving it much brighter -- and I hoped that the foundation primer would work as well as the serum. And it does!<br /><br />I have used at least a half-dozen foundation primers over the years. I find that they not only help with foundation application, they also help foundation look better and last longer. For a couple of years now, I've used Avon's Magix Face Perfector, which is a reasonably priced, fine product. Having now used Eclipse Foundation Primer, though, I have a new favorite.<br /><br />For starters, this product goes on and absorbs into the skin with amazing ease. It comes out of the container in a semi-solid state and then just melts as I rub it into the skin. After letting it sink in for a minute (it doesn't take long), I'm ready to apply foundation, which then goes on smoothly and evenly. Applied over this primer, my foundation is more consistently even, which looks very nice. And with the foundation being smoother on the face, my blusher and powder apply more smoothly and evenly, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the Eclipse primer is the way it helps me go without foundation altogether! It makes my skin feel and appear so silky, I can just apply a bit of blusher and I'm ready to go. Since I'm 63, that's saying something!<br /><br />The Amazon product description refers to the primer as a &#34;powdery gel&#34; -- and that's a perfect description. It feels really good on my skin and makes my skin look better regardless of whether I follow it with foundation, just powder or blusher, or nothing else at all.<br /><br />The price of this foundation primer seems a bit high until it becomes apparent how long it lasts. It doesn't take much to cover the face; a little goes a long way. Plus, if you go to the Global Care Essentials website, you'll see that it's substantially higher there than on Amazon!<br /><br />My experience with this product has been thoroughly delightful, and I'm very glad to have found it. I can recommend it highly.",[],B017IIV4XI,B017IIV4XI,AEIFO5AJLF3XTOJVUOZAFOJJSDDQ,1466484164000,0,False

My foundation, eye-shadow etc. goes on perfectly. The best part is that it makes my skin look as smooth as it feels.  Due to it being so smooth it lasts until I decide to wash it off.

5.0,Amazing product for extremely dry skin,"When you scoop the product out of the container, it is a thick paste that tends to be crumbly. You have to carefully massage it onto your skin, making sure little chunks don't fall on the ground. But it definitely works to soften, protect and heal extremely dry, irritated, and even cracked skin. And a little does go a long way. The container is glass and just small enough to fit in my coat pocket, which makes it convenient to carry around.<br /><br />I have serious eczema, and Gold Clover and Burt's Bees Hand Salve are the only natural products that are thick enough to provide relief. The difference between this and Burt's Bees is that Gold Clover is less greasy and seems to absorb quicker. But Burt's Bees smells better to me. Although this Gold Clover does have a light mint/lavender scent, overall the product smells milky. It doesn't bother me too much and thankfully the smell does go away. However, the smell reminds me baby milk spit up. Also, sometimes the thought of rubbing dead animal fat on my skin gets a little weird. But I use this several times a day, especially after hand washing, and my skin is looking better than ever.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product that provides relief for eczema and healing for extremely dry skin. It's a great alternative to chemically-laden but well-publicized products like O'Kieff's for Working Hands. If you order in bulk, it's more economical to do it through their website. But for just one, it's cheaper to order on Amazon. And I will definitely be ordering more!",[],B01H0RZB4U,B01H0RZB4U,AHL47FCIM5NLRK4WSKMZL324GQLA,1480611429000,1,True

They're not completely gone, still I've noticed a improvement.  I've been using it for about a month and any acne I had is controlled. I didn't have a major problem with acne. Just now and then a couple would come up and and leave dark spots. The dark spots were more of a problem to me. I have olive complexion, oily skin, and I'm in my 30's. In my teens I didn't have problems with acne. So it became frustrating to have them in my 30's. I  also used it on a dark spot on my foot that I got from a bug bite months ago. The bug bite swelling went away but the dark spot remained. After using this Dead Sea soap it started to fade too. One thing I didn't expect was that the soap doesn't lather very much.

The polish would crack and peel away. All that time to paint your nails, two coats of color with 15 minutes in between to dry and a top coat that takes 20 minutes to dry. All that time and it only lasts one day if your lucky. What a waste of time! Well gel colors have changed all that and Sally Hansen has not only made a good one but it's also affordable.

I use it like a body spray, and I get 2-3 decent hours out of it with 6-8 sprays.<br /><br />If you love a clean jasmine and do not mind the poor performance, then I definitely recommend this fragrance to you.  You can find other jasmine fragrances with better performance, but you will pay a lot more.  For the price point, this is a nice fragrance.  I think it leans feminine, but the right man could pull it off.  Good day or night and any venue.  Good for just about any age, too.  This is a soft, light, green jasmine soliflore.  I did not take off any stars for performance because I feel it would be churlish to do so at this price point.

This curler has soft pads plus five extra sets of pads for the curling tips. It is so strong it has an easy to remove clip to hold it closed when not in use.

It's getting harder and harder to resist the call of the dreaded razor.<br /><br />I purchased this product several months ago and have used the epilator and callus sander attachments. The sander works the same as any other battery powered shaver.  The epilator is a life changer though. The first time you use it is a bit rough if you haven't used one before, or get waxed. But I haven't had to pick up a razor since I started using this. Each time is easier, and the hairs grow back soft rather than the nasty stubble you get from shaving. Also, I've noticed less and less hair growing back. I could probably pluck the individual hairs on my legs if I had to.<br />Be warned though that the ingrown hair issue is real.  If you do not exfoliate you will regret it.  As to the battery life issue, when I first started using this I would be able to only do one whole leg before the battery started winding down. I could maybe get through both armpits and forearms on a single charge. But now there's so little hair that I can do everything on one charge (both legs from foot to groin, armpits and forearms).<br />With all this said, the device stopped working today. It will charge, and the light turns on, but it won't spin.  I have a feeling I'm going to need a new battery.

4.0,Finally got them!,"&lt;Edit---> after using them a bit................................................................................. they're exactly what I needed! So I'm quite active in my sleep and was worried they would just fall off in the night. Well these seem to stay on my head throughout the night! Also I had seen something about color bleeding in a review so I was a bit worri3d about that as well because my main purpose for getting these were to wear at night after a shower so my pillows won't get completely soaked. Also so that my cold wet hair wouldn't be all over the place lol well there's been no color bleeding and my hair has little to no frizz when I wake up now! Being able to leave my hair down while still somewhat wet, my hair dries naturally and my curls aren't looking like I just got my socks rocked off 🤣><br /><br />I don't think my first review was approved because I was quite upset when I wrote it. Well I finally got them! I had ordered these along with a couple other items. My tracking for this said it was delivered in the same box as something else I had ordered. Well they weren't in there! Amazon was pretty quick to replace the things I did not receive and I appreciate that!<br /><br />So I did just receive these today and I'm wearing it now after my hair had dried just a lil bit after my shower. It seems to be holding up. The band is a bit big though so I have to put it up behind my ears so it doesn't fall down and cover my whole face. I do have quite a bit of hair. Thick and wavy so I love how much room there is for my hair. I'm glad it's not cutting off circulation on my head but I am a bit worried it might fall off while sleeping since they are a bit loose. First time ever wearing a bonnet so I can't really compare it to others but they seem like ok quality. They're soft and hoping it helps me to wake up with less frizzy hair!

5.0,Valentia : True Glow Eye Cream Review,"Next on the Valentia beauty line, comes the True Glow Eye Cream for review. I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!<br /><br />Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:<br /><br />Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles<br />Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes<br />Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.<br />Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.<br /><br />Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",[],B014DH4FTC,B014DH4FTC,AEKWD5653VPVL7PHTDABCF5V7JCQ,1456791554000,0,False
5.0,Oz Naturals: 2.5% Retinol Serum with Astaxanthin and Vitamin E Review,"The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.<br /><br />Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!<br /><br />I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!<br /><br />Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.<br /><br />Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonal allergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Oz Naturals.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BM03DDkhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BM03DDkhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BM03DDkhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vQhsCUfEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vQhsCUfEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vQhsCUfEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00NT0AR7E,B00NT0AR7E,AEKWD5653VPVL7PHTDABCF5V7JCQ,1429925492000,178,False
5.0,InstaNatural: Cellulite Cream Review,"InstaNatural: Cellulite Cream<br /><br />This product is part of their Body Creams collection and helps with everything from the cellulite to the dimples a person may suffer from. You get a boost from:<br /><br />Caffeine- Derived from green tea, which provides you with instant firming and lifting results<br />Retinol- allows the skin to resurface at a quicker pace, lessening the appearance of the cellulite/dimples<br />Cocoa Butter- softens and also helps keep the skin looking beautiful<br />Shea Butter- allows the “newer” skin to get a healthy amount of nutrients and moisture<br />Vitamin C- helps your skin hold more moisture and gives it a healthy glow (brightens)<br />Vitamin B5- helps to keep skin soft and healthy, but also provides a smoother look<br />All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested<br /><br />Application- The product works best when applied twice a day, just like a facial skincare regimen. You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.<br /><br />What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I’m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural’s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the “turn-over” process of shedding our “damaged” looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin’s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

3.0,Good Soap But Doesn't Last Long,"This is a good soap that lathers well and helped keep my skin RELATIVELY moist. It wasn't as good as others to that effect, but it did do a nice job of cleaning my skin from head to toe.<br /><br />The ingredients are really solid in this soap. From the charcoal to the dead sea salt, you get quite a bit of quality packed in. The problem is that this bar of soap quickly becomes soft and starts to break apart after about 2/3 use. This makes it difficult to use and therefore it starts to fall down into the drain, along with the value of this specific soap.<br /><br />If this soap lasted another week I would give it 4-5 stars. However, it lasted less than a week for two of us sharing it. At $14-16 a week in soap, there is not enough of a value proposition there for us to continue using it. There are better options on the market for both value and effectiveness in the areas we would like to have seen better with this soap.",[],B08N6YHQXT,B08N6YHQXT,AHKDB7ZTU7PAKM3DPDCJWHQPUP3Q,1617882052186,0,False

I removed the extensions, gave my hair a break, and proceeded with the 2nd set. I did not use any heat and even wore a silk bonnet to sleep to keep the quality of the hair in good condition to last longer.  1 day shy of a week I had to remove them, and was so confused as to how this set was in worse condition and had been cared for better. Now I'm 1 1/2 weeks into the 3rd set, curling on 225° heat, using heat protection spray, and notice that there are strands melted throughout.

3.0,Good...IF,"This is a potentially excellent product--IF you don't need it to be completely stable.  It wiggles some, though if you put your weight directly over the leg and push straight up, it's fine.  Just don't expect it to be rock solid.  I have a regular grab bar on the right side and use the left support rail only--and that's fine because the two rails are not directly connected so you can use one rail or both.  But as a big guy (230 lbs), I'd be nervous if I didn't have the grab bar even though it's rated for 300 lbs.  it would be perfect for a smaller person who just needs a boost, but it could be potentially dangerous if a larger person with serious balance problems fell sideways.<br /><br />Note, too, that this will NOT work with a 1-piece toilet that curves upward from seat to tank.  The connector piece needs about 2 inches of flat space behind the seat.<br /><br />Pros:  Sturdy aluminum tube construction; designed to bear weight directly over the support; easy to put together with a screwdriver and maybe a pliers (depending on your toilet seat hardware); adjustable for height and width.<br /><br />Cons:  Works only with a traditional toilet; ""wiggles"" to the left and right; adjusting width and height might be difficult or impossible for a person with poor hand strength (the spring loaded buttons are stiff); made in China (but what isn't these days).",[],B00KO2PT96,B00KO2PT96,AF2FHIOZUNV67HEU4MSXQ5DZ5A5A,1405048765000,17,True

2.0,"A Unique, All-In-One Serum","I was in the cosmetics and skincare business for 25 years and am very ingredient conscious. The makeup of this serum is truly impressive. It's also unusual to find one with Vitamin C and Retinol together in the same serum. This was my first time using this product and I was trying a new moisturizer as well so I did a controlled study. I washed my face and applied the serum alone. My face turned very red and hot like a bad sunburn. I washed it off, applied straight aloe Vera gel to calm my skin and left it on overnight. By the next morning all was well so I cleansed my skin as usual and applied the new moisturizer (which was also by Elrique Naturals) and the same thing happened. Needless to say both products were extremely uncomfortable to use. Comparing the ingredients I don't see anything listed on either product that would cause this. I first suspected Niacinimide (Vitamin B3), but it's not listed. It's possible that the Vitamin C was too strong for my skin but there is none in the moisturizer. I have no issues with Retinol so that's not it.

3.0,Extremely strong scent.,"My husband tried this as he was looking for a new deodorant for when out on his mountain bike and for going to the gym.

Obviously he wasn't smelling the perfume in the deodorant while he was riding as the wind was moving it away from his face.  However, when he finally got home, both he and I could still smell it on him.  It was still quite strong.<br /><br />Overall the product seems to stem the sweat from his underarms where he put it, but the strong scent of perfume (especially at the gym) made him self conscious for other reasons.  While he was not stinky, he was definitely smelly.<br /><br />Overall this seems to be the way that most deodorants are going.

3.0,Ehhh,"Is it weird that I'm happy I finally found a Sol de Janeiro product that I don't absolutely love? I've been loving the bum bum cream and the body wash, and just FINALLY ran out of my Chapstick. I decided to splurge (to say the least) and try this stuff, because I love everything else by them. First thing when I opened it was that I saw this thing is HUGE. Definitely way bigger than my lips. It's really awkward applying it. That, and the scent/taste... ugh, I hate it. I don't think it's universally awful, but to me, the first thing I thought of was buttered popcorn. That's what it smells like to me, and I hate that smell. I was hoping it would smell like their other products, but it doesn't. As far as the product itself is concerned, it goes on more like an oil than a balm. And it feels like an oil. I don't like the feeling of it for the first 10 minutes or so after applying it. Once you give it time to dry and soak in, it's not bad, but I'm also not like &#34;wow, this stuff is incredible!&#34; I mean I can achieve the same results with my $2 Chapstick. I'm torn. I really want to like the product, and since I have it now I will continue using it, however I just don't think it's worth spending $18 on.

5.0,Very Pretty Scrunchies!,"I have a couple of pure silk scrunchies already, but they are colorful and can only be used with certain things. I really love my silk scrunchies, however, and decided to get more in more neutral tones. This selection is perfect! You can match your general hair color, or your outfit, or use any of these as a neutral accessory to any color.<br /><br />Although this is probably more than you generally spend on scrunchies, you will be very pleased with silk. It is very gentle on your hair. You will have your ponytail held securely, but the scrunchy will pull off easily, smoothly, and without taking a few hairs along with it. And they just LOOK so nice.<br /><br />I wash my silk scrunchies in a lingerie bag with my other hand washables and hang them up to dry (which they do very quickly).<br /><br />These arrived very quickly. Each is individually wrapped in a small plastic bag, and then they are all in a good, reusable silicone type zipper bag. It is perfect for storing these!

5.0,"Oh, yummmm! (But don't eat it...LOL)","This lotion, or body cream, is amazing. For the price, and it's a good price for the style of the cream and the fragrance, this is an amazing lotion. It's creamy, thick and rich and the fragrance is strong but not overpowering. This has a subtle burnt brown sugar scent with a strong vanilla overtone. It's just ever so slightly greasy right at first, but it absorbs very quickly and is just soft and luxurious. It takes very little to spread over a larger surface, so it lasts for a long time too. This larger, 8-ounce bottle, is too big for carrying in a purse, but for overnight bags, beach bags, etc., it's great, and perfect for at home. Get the hand lotion in the 4-ounce bottle if you want it in a small enough size for a purse.<br /><br />I love smelly stuff--lotions, perfumes, body washes, candles, etc. Bodycology is really as good as some of the pricier brands but at a much more reasonable price. If you like other brown sugar vanilla products, or burnt warm sugar products, or warm vanilla scented products, then you'll probably like this scent too, and the lotion is just creamy and nice.",[],B004OH5W6W,B004OH5W6W,AH73A2QSKETT44H4JIPB7WCPP5ZA,1344470714000,1,False

It looks like it's already been used for a week. I attached a photo of how it looks after me only using it twice on my face and hands. That is why this product gets 4 stars instead of 5. For $25, I do not feel that you're getting your money's worth.<br /><br />With that being said, Korean skin care is always amazing. This lotion in particular smells like roses, but it's not overpowering. It's also light enough where it absorbed into my skin, which I am happy about, because I want to be able to put this on in the morning and put makeup over top of it.<br /><br />It does not make my skin look shiny. It's not tacky or sticky. It leaves my skin feeling very, very soft and luminous, which does make me look very youthful and pretty. Overall, I think this product does what it claims to do. It's a great skin care product, and I will use this every day, but it will probably only last me about one month. I am in my 20's, and I do not have any major skin problems or wrinkles. I am not the best case study for a before-and-after, but I do like this a lot more than many other lotions I have tried.<br /><br />I got to try this for free in exchange for my honest review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YK1vYElcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YK1vYElcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YK1vYElcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01D3Y86UU,B01D3Y86UU,AFNZXFHLJKEJTV6DFDGOYJPQGTXQ,1471730609000,5,False

I think this will last me 1-3 months, depending on how often I use it.<br /><br />It sort of smells like lime, but it's not exactly a citrus smell. Even though it shows images of avocado, it doesn't really smell like avocado. It has a gel-like consistency. A little goes a long way, so I recommend only using a little, and adding more as needed. Thankfully, the smell is subtle once you rub it into your skin, and it is not overpowering at all.<br /><br />Normally, my skin is too sensitive to have any scented lotion, so I usually use unscented lotion that contains oatmeal. I put the Mascream on my face, and it stung a teeny tiny bit, but nothing like most scented lotions. I massaged it into my skin, and it feels really soft.

(<br />I applied this mask, twisted my hair up, put a plastic grocery bag on my head and then a towel wrapped on my head for warmth and to hide the plastic bag.  I left it on for about 45 minutes or so, then jumped in the shower rinsed it all out. What a huge, huge difference.

Press for 10-15 seconds and they will stay in place for days. I keep the spare nails in a ziploc baggie with the nail file and glue in my purse in case I need to make a quick repair on the go.<br /><br />FYI the pink nail glue that comes with the nails is OK, it adheres for about 3-4 days without lifting but the Amazon IBC brush on nail glue is AWESOME!

It even tells you when it needs cleaning, charging and time used for each shave.<br /><br />At first, I thought I would never use the cleaning system, but since I had it I would at least try it. The cleaning system works very good and conditions the razor. It also recharges the razor if you leave the system on, with the lever down. Now I have been using the cleaning system every couple of days, because I like the way it conditions the blades.<br /><br />I have used several Norelco electric razors for the last 30 years and have always been satisfied with the razors. However, the Norelco 9170XL is so much more superior it's hard to compare. This electric razor gives me a much closer shave, cleaner, faster shave then any of my older electric razors.

Instructions:  1)  have a separate tooth brush for the mud, it will look dingy;  2)  get the toothbrush wet first 3)  rinse out your mouth with water first 4)  close your mouth when you brush - this is the most important instruction....the mud will splatter everywhere and smear all over the lips if you forget  5)  spit into a cup rather than the bowl, there's just no keep it from splattering all over the sink, so spit into a cup, it's just easier and flush down the sink with a lot of water  when done.  That's it - here's &#34;Magic Mud in your Mouth to keep gums and teeth bright and healthy&#34;.",[],B00FCCFVTQ,B07VGB3JZP,AEPEFOBAJA4VTLFWMTATJKY54UHQ,1407867262000,2,False

In addition to being a lot less expensive it has a much simplified design which should last longer, and has a user replaceable battery.<br /><br />On the negative side, it seems to chew through batteries.  In fact I actually reported the first one Amazon shipped as defective as it stopped working after 5 days.  Turns out the batteries I swapped were dead too and there was nothing wrong with the toothbrush after all.  My bad.  The fresh batteries I installed only lasted maybe 3 weeks or so.  I'm going to use rechargeables from now on, but just be forewarned that this thing gobbles batteries.<br /><br />But in terms of the operation of the toothbrush I love it.

I can feel that it is in my hair, but it doesn’t bother me even after a second application the next morning if I need to freshen up without time for a shower. Also, the first day I used it I thought it made my hair oily but after using it for a few days it no longer does that. I have been told that curls don’t need to be washed everyday, so when I use this every morning for a few days, the day I do wash my hair it feels like the softest hair on the planet.<br /><br />I found this product on Think Dirty Shop Clean, it is where I find all of my products to ensure safety for my body as well as my hair. Because of this, I am not working through residues on my hair, if you are then your experience might be different. I cannot stress enough how much better your hair will feel after the transition to good quality shampoos and products, and getting rid of the chemicals left on your hair from low quality products.

4.0,Great for psoriasis,"I buy everything I review. To receive FIVE stars, a product must meet &#62;90% of the manufacturer's claims. I don’t subtract because I don’ t like the color or appearance (too subjective and personal). I review form, function, ease of use, and construction quality. Please forgive typos: I’m an evidence-based scientist, NOT a typist. If you find my review helpful, please click &#34;YES&#34;. This helps me improve future evaluations (which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions).<br /><br />Their Claim:  Controls the itch of psoriasis<br /><br />My Verdict (details below):  True for most people<br /><br />As a physician, I know how itchy this condition can be on your scalp. I recommend coal tar shampoo to all my patients. Most dandruff shampoos use salicylic acid (which is aspirin) for the itching, which is NOT very good at stopping the itch. My wife has tried that with NO success. Coal tar is much better at controlling it and is the active ingredient in most topical creams for psoriasis of the skin. It's available in higher strengths by prescription, but this product at 2.5% is sufficient for most scalps.<br /><br />Just use it 3x/week for adequate control. Let it sit in the scalp for five minutes, which means apply immediately upon entering the shower, then do your stuff. Just before exiting, wash it out. It's okay to leave some in the scalp; it won't hurt you. You may wish to use shampoo after, but this has shampoo/conditioner in it and in my experience, using other hair products is counterproductive.<br /><br />This tingles, so you know it's working. The only problem? It's nearly impossible to find in stores, and is often sold out at Amazon. Other companies make similar products. Just type COAL TAR SHAMPOO in the search bar to find others. They all have 2.5-3% coal tar. You need a script for 5% for some idiotic reason. What, you're going to get addicted to the stuff and overdose?

5.0,LOVE these wonderful scents!!! But…,"There are three main things that are special about this hand sanitizer:<br /><br />(1) they ALL smell WONDERFUL.<br />(2) they pack a LOT of sprays into these tiny bottles so they are especially great for travel. They supposedly hold 500 sprays.<br />(3) if you love Disney, these are cute as can be!<br /><br />But there are two things I don’t like so much:<br />(1) the cost. If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that’s not a bad value on a per use basis— but about $50 for 4 of these is more money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can’t see any way to refill them. Most purse size hand sanitizers can be refilled—even though you wouldn’t get the same great smelling original product.<br /><br />Overall, these are certainly wonderful products and I LOVE them!  But for me they are mainly special occasion hand sanitizers.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

4.0,Not a set of 10,"This is advertised and sold as a ten piece set of nail polishes, but its actually two separate sets with almost identical colors.  One set of 6 smaller bottles come in a clear plastic zip-lock cosmetic bag, and a second box of 4 larger bottles.  The set of 6 smaller bottles also comes with a glittery toe separator and kitty-shaped emory board.  The set of 4 larger bottles also comes with 50 nail stickers.<br /><br />These are the colors that you get:<br />Gold glitter (a small and a large bottle)<br />Baby blue (small and large bottle)<br />Baby pink (small and large bottle)<br />Violet (small and large bottle)<br /><br />Additional small bottles:<br />A slightly brighter baby pink<br />A deeper pink<br /><br />I took a photo to show you that the polish is the correct consistency and I applied it to my nails easily.  It dries quickly.  Since this is water-based nail polish meant for little girls, it wears off quickly.  And you can peel it off very easily. That way, you don’t need harsh nail polish remover to take it off.<br /><br />This is not really suitable as a single 10 piece gift set since the bottles come in two totally separate packages of 4+6, and since ALL of the 4 larger bottles duplicate with the same color that is included in the set of 6 smaller bottles.  It is better as two separate (but similar) gifts.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases becasue I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

4.0,Nice gift set!,"I got the set with the insulated tumbler cup that says “Beauty begins the moment you love yourself.”  The outside of the gift box says “Thinking of you.”  This would make a really nice gift set for someone who is going through a tough time.

4.0,A bargain for basic eyebrow brushes!,"These brushes are great for a more finished look to your eyebrows.  I needed a new one—this package of 8 was an unbelievably low price averaging 87 cents each ($6.99 total for 8 brushes)—so now I have a lot of extras!  I wanted a short handled eyebrows brush to fit in my makeup bag—these are only 4 1/4 inches from end to end—long enough to handle comfortably, and short enough to fit.  They are exactly what I wanted, and great for travel.  They are not the highest quality brushes—one brush has a single bristle out of place, and another has a couple of plastic comb prongs not quite straight—but the price was a bargain, and I have plenty in the pack that are just fine (and the slight issues I mentioned don’t make a difference to that one brush).

2.0,Just eh,"I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy and this was recommended to me as I have been taping my eye shut for the past two months. There are definitely positives and negatives to it. Overall, I wish the string was more comfortable and that the foam was slightly sticky so that it would adhere to my face so it wouldn't move around as much.<br /><br />Positives - overall it does work. I am able to function for a lot longer than I could with the drops alone. I had to add a drop of liquid in order to really get the 'humidity' in the patch to start to build up. Honestly, I'm going through a lot so crying is not abnormal right now so that happened on its own.<br /><br />Negatives - The string is VERY uncomfortable. It really needs to be much thicker so that it doesn't cut into the skin. I wasn't able to sleep with this as the only protection for my eye as I move around a lot and because it doesn't stick at all I would have knocked it off easily.",[],B00JFDBHQE,B07KYWXBDZ,AHCGLG7ZKARBX6RGAGSLQW4VTGMQ,1678364750805,0,True

5.0,DONT WAIT AS LONG AS I DID!,"I had this on wishlist for months now, debating back and forth if I needed it. If you're doing debating as well, seriously just buy it. Its less than 10 bucks and definitely worth using on your ears or other pierced areas. I have very sensitive skin so when I went up a size before I got the balm, my ears would be irritated for weeks to a little over a month. They would constantly be hot, itchy, dry and clear discharge would be oozing down my neck. GROSS! I even waited 10 months to go up a size and that was only at the 12G-10G stage.<br /><br />2 days after I got the balm, I prepped my ears after a shower. Rubbed the balm generously over my left ear and on the taper. There was very minimal tugging and it did not make me cringe. Took less than a minute to get the taper in compared to before, taking over 5 minutes of twisting, pushing, & massaging to get the taper in w/out the balm. Took no more than 5 days to &#34;fully heal.&#34; No dry, flaky, irritated, oozing ear. Waited 6 months this time around to size up to 2G.<br /><br />At the same time, my right ear was already infected because I had to replace my plug but I was out in public and only had a spare in my purse. I cleaned it as best as I can but it didnt work. My ear felt like it was back to its newly stretched phase- cracked skin, bump under the ear and clear discharge constantly flowing down. Cleaned my plugs and my ear with salt water then rubbed the balm all over. It started to heal up faster than it did when all I had was salt water & vitamin E oil.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who's trying to stretch their ears.",[],B005BZQHEC,B005BZQHEC,AF3DEGPJYY75I5NFXSHJXXN2S4HA,1410891052000,4,True

3.0,"ASP Lightless Gel is awesome for repairing a broken natural nail, a must have!","UPDATE 10/13/14 I had originally rated this item a five stars and I've left my original review unedited because it was accurate HOWEVER I've changed the rating to three stars because of the following.<br /><br />I've found that when I use this product to repair a broken, or pealing or split nail, when its freshly applied, it's awesome BUT when a few days go by and the product starts to get old it starts to lift and the problem is that even being very careful, if the product peals from the nail, IT TAKES A FEW LAYERS OF THE NATURAL NAIL WITH IT and that's what I was one of the things I was trying to prevent when I applied this product...What I ended up doing was soaking off the remainder of this product and patching the now really damaged area of my nail with ASP Fiberglass<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=asp%20fiberglass&sprefix=ASP+fi%2Caps%2C272 and two layers of brush on nail glue which is the method I plan to continue using from now on since it does not lift and tear my nails...http://www.amazon.com/Spilo-MISC-Bondini-Plus-Brush-On/dp/B0002Z8SE8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413205777&sr=8-1&keywords=brush+on+nail+glue.<br /><br />Although I bought mine at my local Sally's, this product is so awesome, I had to come an give it a thumbs up!<br /><br />Now let me say that I have natural nails that tend to break at the base (bead) of the nail & so cutting them is not a painfree option nor a pretty one at that ;)<br /><br />The only reason why I use all three products (listed below) is to repair broken nails, to give them time to grow out while I get to have pretty, all the same length nails ;)<br /><br />This ""light less gel"" has a thicker consistency than brush on glue, which by the way, was the method I was using prior to coming across this gem in a YouTube tutorial video.<br /><br />Now it does not come with a brush applicator so I took an empty nail polish bottle, cleaned it out & I filled it with pure acetone to prevent the brush from getting hard; & that's the brush I use to apply this gel.  Just make sure to wipe the brush a few time on a napkin before using to wipe off the acetone.<br /><br />After I've removed the old nail polish, I wipe my nail clean with either an alcohol pad or some acetone. I then cut an appropriate piece of the fiberglass to cover the break.  I apply the fiberglass to the clean nail & I apply a thin line of this gel over the patch, then I take my handy, dandy nail polish brush & I spread out a thin layer of the gel over the entire nail, same as if I was applying nail polish.  Then I spray the Gel Cure (which is a god sent because it dries this thick gel almost instantly) & voila! the nail is as good as not, well you know ;) Now depending on the size of the break, use your judgement to determine if you need a 2nd layer.  This method last more than the regular nail glue & as such, soaking it off will take a little more time but who cares as long as your nail has time to grown without suffering from either pain or an odd looking manicure ;)<br /><br />When you add the cost of the fiberglass, the gel & the cure, you are looking at approximately $30 BUT this will last a long, long, long time so for me its cost effective.<br /><br />If you have natural nails that tend to split, these items are a must.  These are staples in my ""manicure rescue arsenal"".<br /><br />Highly recommended items for sure!<br /><br />I bought this ""light less gel"", the<br /><br />ASP Gel Cure<br />http://www.amazon.com/ASP-Gel-Cure/dp/B00IYPRZOW/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1402513514&sr=1-3&keywords=lightless+gel<br /><br />& the ASP All Season Nail Fiberglass Nail Wrap<br />http://www.amazon.com/All-Season-Nail-Fiberglass-Wrap/dp/B0064TPMIQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1402513563&sr=1-1&keywords=nail+fiberglass<br /><br />UPDATE 7/3/14<br />Just wanted to point out that should you decide to yank off this product with you teeth or if you are a ""picker"", be prepared to lose a layer or two of your natural nail. WHICH MEANS DAMAGING YOUR NAIL UNTIL IT GROWS OUT WHICH DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING AND APPLYING THIS PRODUCT.  This product should be removed with a cotton ball soaked in acetone, wrapped in aluminum foil for about ten to fifteen minutes so as to remove the product safely WITHOUT damaging your nail.

This photo I took shows my eye on the left side with my old mascara on it, and the eye of the right has the Curl Addict mascara. What a huge difference!<br /><br />I have bought black-brown mascara in the past, but I like the look of this carbon black. The brush is different than I’ve used in the past- it has three parts that “bubble” out compared to just one brush that goes straight across. Works just as well as the straight across brush that i’m used to.<br /><br />I was looking for more natural/organic ingredients in my make up, and although this brand doesn’t go along with that philosophy, I do like how this mascara makes a big impact in my overall make up look. It was also packaged really cute and made up feel like I was receiving a gift in the mail. I am very happy with this purchase!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OUZY1oPJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OUZY1oPJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OUZY1oPJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T8mxdUcuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T8mxdUcuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T8mxdUcuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vTX8xgzJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vTX8xgzJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vTX8xgzJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814u3AnGw8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814u3AnGw8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814u3AnGw8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B075GDJZWQ,B075GDJZWQ,AGX7W5LDHKX4PTJR66QMDGVYNV6A,1520732710067,1,True

4.0,if you like that flaxmeal/hempseed sort of taste you'll like this oil,"This is a large UV-protected BPA-free plastic bottle. I've been slathering it all over myself to see what effect it had topically. I personally like the smell-it's a soft wheaty-flaxy-earthy smell. It smells like something real which is what it is; nothing else but the real cold-pressed oil. I also like the taste which is similar to the smell. I haven't tried it yet but think it might be able to be used as the oil in salad dressings- if you like the taste. As to the topical effect well first it just sits on your skin but after a minute or two it just disappears into your skin which continues to smell faintly of the smell I mentioned above. I think it does the job of softening skin- a sort of hydrating, softening effect on my hands which already were fine so the effect isn't noticeably apparent. My feet seem to be loving this stuff (put socks on after you put the oil on!) and seem to be smoother and stay that way all day. I actually bought it to eat- and from what I've read one or two teaspoons a day is a good amount for those who aren't sure if they get enough vitamin E in their diet<br /> (salad greens, whole wheat, sunflower seeds etc) I have read that vitamin E is antagonistic to estrogen so if you are on the pill you should see if this has any negative effects when taking the pill- I don't know the answer. In general too much estrogen isn't a good thing so perhaps this characteristic of vitamin E would be helpful to some- especially men who are worried about too much estrogen? Anyway you don't want to take too much of anything in particular and you can take too much vitamin E (fat soluble )but as far as I can tell that amount is more than a 'reasonable person' would think of taking anyway. I have only taken it for two days internally and already notice that my hands and feet seem to be a lot warmer and since it's supposed to be good for circulation that's to be expected. The company that makes it, Naissance, British, sourced from Scotland, has tried to make a topnotch product and I think has achieved it. I contacted the company several times with questions and they speedily answered them with friendly, helpful answers and were willing to do what was necessary to make me happy with my purchase.

My forehead and nose usually always sweat and they stayed pretty dry. And this morning I woke up without sweating in undesirable places. I've only tried this product for one day, but holy moley, even just waking up in the morning not soaked is a huge game changer. I'm concerned about overheating on warmer days though, so may have to just use with some caution. But the instructions technically say only use at night, 1 hour after showing, and don't use during the day. So maybe that's why. Also I had at least followed the 1 hour after showering thing and I did not experience any stinging or pain even in the slightest that some others mentioned. Usually after showering and exfoliating your skin it might be more sensitive immediately after, so if folks are using it immediately after maybe that's why it stings? Lastly, I do use a light moisturizer on my face because my cheeks get dry. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the brand, so it is an Ives and you can figure out the rest.

I cannot figure out how you'd blow-dry hair that's IN a shower cap as you do it (part of the instructions), so I just removed the cap and did the blowdry while gently combing through the hair with a comb (until dry). Then a rinse - this is where all the blue looks like it's coming out. Use cooler water.<br /><br />We re-dyed every 7 days, and the colour stayed vibrant.<br /><br />Since then, it's been about two months and the electric blue went to pale cotton-candy blue, then to teal, now it's the colour that blonde hair goes with too much pool chlorine in the summer (sort of a washed-out green).

5.0,Better than Sonicare or Interplak,"This is the fourth electric toothbrush I've owned in 7-8 years, and is by far my favorite.<br /><br />I did love my Interplak brushes, which came recommended by my dentist as having the best cleaning action, but they were not durable (hence ""brushes"" and not ""brush""). They say the key to getting an Interplak to last is to not use toothpaste, just dip the brush head into some Listerine. Sorry, but for me that wasn't a satisfying brushing experience.<br /><br />After two Interplaks died, I moved on to Sonicare. That brush is more durable. My husband is still using it. But when I went to the dentist and told the hygienist who cleaned my teeth that I used a Sonicare, she said that must be the reason my gums were bleeding. In fact, she said pretty much every patient she sees that has bleeding gums is using a Sonicare. I don't think she means that no one can clean their teeth successfully with that brand of brush, but apparently it fails a lot of people.<br /><br />I did find the Sonicare to be a very tough toothbrush to use because of what I'll call ""the splatter factor."" I couldn't brush some areas of my mouth very thoroughly without spraying toothpaste everywhere. I can't count the number of times I had to change my shirt after brushing in the morning. Because it was difficult to maneuver, I probably didn't brush my gums the way I should have.<br /><br />So, my dentist recommended a Braun / Oral B brush. Initially, they recommended a brush that cost more than $100. It had all kinds of bells and whistles, including a digital display that you could affix to your mirror which would tell you how well you were brushing. I decided to first try the Braun technology with this super-affordable model, partly because of my experience changing brushes over the years, and partly because the Oral B web site claimed the exact same plaque removing power (I think 97 percent) for every single brush they offer, regardless of price.<br /><br />This model has absolutely NO bells or whistles. It doesn't even have the standard LED light on the handle to show you when it's recharging. It just has one button that turns it on and off. That's all I need.<br /><br />A couple of key differences between the Sonicare and the Oral B brushes:<br /><br />1) With this Oral B brush, I can use REAL toothpaste.<br /><br />2) The entire brush head rotates, not the individual brushes. For me, this is more comfortable. It also takes the splatter factor down to about zero.<br /><br />3) Both brushes have a 2-minute timer, but whereas the Sonicare shuts off after two minutes, this Oral B brush gives a pulsing signal at two minutes and then keeps going. For me personally, this is preferred, because I rarely finish brushing in the two minutes allotted. When I'm done, I hit the power button.<br /><br />4) The standard brush head is smaller than some. That is by design -- you brush one tooth at a time rather than sweeping the brush across your teeth -- but some might prefer something with more coverage.<br /><br />It's been several months. My gums are healthier and the battery is going strong. I just bought an additional Vitality brush for my preschool-age son, who's finding it very manageable.<br /><br />My one real complaint is the same one I have had about every electric toothbrush I've owned, which is that you have to remove the brush head  and rinse off the brush mechanism after each use. If you don't, you get a raunchy build-up in that area. I guess there must be something that requires the brushes to be engineered this way, since it's the way all the manufacturers make them. Just be aware of this as you care for your brush.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: You aren't going to beat the value of this brush. It's outstanding technology at a terrific price (and the Amazon price is $3-5 less than what you'll find at retailers).",[],B000GBICYE,B000GBICYE,AFNY5FSWFJHLFV3Z2W2GVAGH6UDA,1229378433000,7,True

2.0,After 4 months No Longer Works,"At first I thought this was going to be the solution to the problem of the original rechargeable Sonicare toothbrush with batteries that can't be replaced (my original Sonicare stopped holding a charge).<br /><br />However, after only four months (just long enough to waste money replacing the brush head!), the button began to only work erratically, and now it does not work at all (can't power the toothbrush on).<br /><br />The reviews that state that the battery compartment does not keep water out are completely true.  The battery compartment is always moist, and the batteries will begin to rust.<br /><br />I was pleased that my Eneloop batteries worked well to power the toothbrush, so I could be using rechargeable batteries, however it doesn't matter if the toothbrush itself doesn't last past 6 months.<br /><br />The batteries that came with the toothbrush lasted around a month.  The Eneloops needed charged only once in the next three months.<br /><br />Looks like the Sonicare brand just fails on too many levels, regardless of whether you are using the ultra-expensive rechargeable unit, or this unit with two AA batteries.<br /><br />[Update] Flashlights have had ""screw on"" caps for nearly one hundred hears.  The Sonicare toothbrush is the same form factor.  I have no idea why someone at Philips thought a ""clip on"" cap (vs. a screw on) would be better, ESPECIALLY for something you use with water.  I am still COMPLETELY BAFFLED by why they would use this design.  The battery compartment will ALWAYS be moist.  Being able to use rechargeable batteries is clearly superior to being stuck with the Philips Soincare charging station.  However, the fact that your batteries get wet means you will eventually ruin your batteries.  That said, I am about to purchase another one.  Being able to use your own batteries makes it a when, both for the fact that you can replace the batteries and also so that the (much more expensive) toothbrush isn't useless when the internal batteries fail after a year or so.  Unfortunately there is no better alternative at this pricep oint.",[],B000FEIOHW,B000FEIOHW,AH7R2XPWHAAHRHO3KZAZ7M3JASXQ,1309803895000,2,True

5.0,Great for fine limp hair,"I am one of those few people that is cursed with very fine hair that becomes oily/greasy if I do not wash it daily. I tend to avoid hair products that contain the word oil in the product description as I do not need any help in it becoming oily. I also do not use conditioner regularly due to the nature of my hair.<br />My first thoughts upon opening my package of the InstaNatural Argan Oil Shampoo, was that it was well protected by the quality seals. There is a thin plastic cover over the bottle to prevent leakage during shipment, and another quality seal that you have to remove by taking off the top of the bottle. The first thing I do when I go to buy or use a new shampoo is to smell it. When ordering hair products online, you do not get to smell before you buy and have to depend on the seller or reviews for a description of the scent. The scent of this shampoo is a clean scent. It is mild and not overwhelming. It is not a perfume smell or a fruity smell. The best way I can describe it is a nice clean mild smell.<br />I started with hair that had been washed the day before, so it was oily and ready for another wash. I wet my hair and applied about a quarter size amount to my hair. I have shoulder length hair, so I do not need much. This shampoo has an amazing lather to it. It is thick and you can really feel it working through your hair. I scrubbed it in from the scalp to the ends. Then I rinsed. I am one of those that needs to feel/hear the squeak when I am rinsing to know my hair is really clean. And this shampoo passed that test very well. I did not use any conditioner afterwards, because I do not normally, unless it is a weekly treatment.<br />I usually air dry my hair, and I did this time as well. My hair came out so soft and full of body and did not have any heavy feeling to it. I woke up this morning without the greasy/oily feel I usually get the next day after I wash. I was very surprised by this, because like I said that is normally what my hair feels like unless I wash it daily. It is still soft and feels silky to the touch.<br />I had my fiance do the sniff test to see what he thought of the smell, and he said it smelled nice.<br />If you are like me and have been avoiding any shampoos because of the description having oil in it, I would say to give this one a try. It is like a clarifying shampoo with just the right amount to give your hair the softness that it needs without weighing it down.<br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410Bj3C1TzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410Bj3C1TzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410Bj3C1TzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AC82KQQ,B01AC82KQQ,AFMGVJ32NRSIEQNVYAZSV7G2SAGA,1455549134000,6,False

1.0,"Not good, cheaply made",I really wanted to like this flat iron but it feels very cheap.

The buttons move around like they feel loose when pressed and sometimes I had to press them multiple times just to get them to work. Another thing that I didn’t like is that after it shuts off it has a constant flashing blue light that doesn’t stop until you unplug it. This flashing is apparently intentional but I didn’t like it. It took several passes to get my very thin hair straight so I ended up returning this product because it is simply not worth the money.

5.0,Just get it!,"I just bought this from Sally's today and use it a little bit ago. I waited until my hair was completely dry before I left a review. This stuff is absolutely amazing! I know Amazon's not going to count this as a verified review since I did not buy it from here which is why I left the picture. I'll give a bit of a backstory of my hair. I ended up falling on the Ombre train and figured I could do it at home. Big mistake! My hair was completely and utterly fried. It has been 9 months and I have used every single thing under the sun to try and keep my hair soft. I have bought masks off of Amazon, Walmart, Sally's Beauty, eBay, Dillons, and any other store that I can find. All of them worked fairly well while my hair is still damp, but after it dries it becomes a bit crunchy again. I really wish I would have taken a before picture of my ends. I could literally hold them and they would stand up straight. This stuff eliminate everything. I have done that extra protein, soy, coconut oil, argan oil, everything you could think of and nothing helped. My hair feels completely healthy and so , so soft again. I'm naturally curly so I have to deal with frizz. After using this, my hair has a natural shine to it (not the oily kind that many hair masks do) My fruzz is under control and my curls are actually separated. I already have an order of this on the way. I know there's only two reviews on this and if I had seen it I would have bypassed it. If you have dry, crunchy, stringy, or unhealthy hair I cannot recommend this enough!

This serum is definitely worth the money - you get 6 oz, which will last a while! The formula is light and gentle, doesn't irritate my skin, and I can use it on every part of my face, chin and neck! I am not breaking out, and I've been using this product for a few weeks now. My skin definitely looks brighter, feels smoother and is well-moisturized.<br /><br />I love products with AHA's - hyaluronic acid is an example of an Alpha-Hydroxy acid, and these ingredients are especially effective at aiding the shedding of old skin - which reveals a healthier complexion underneath those layers! This is an excellent serum and I've incorporated it into my skin care routine! If you're like me and you're looking for good stuff, look no further! Your skin will thank you!

I have been using this face wash now for about 6 days. I like to use them for at least 4-5 days to see how they react to my skin. When I use this, it makes my skin feel so clean and soft.  I have been using it every morning and every other night. normally if I would use my Aveeno that often my skin tends to dry out but so far I haven't had any of the dryness. I love that this face wash is not heavily scented. its very light and makes my skin feel good. I definitely will be using more of this is the future.

5.0,the best straightener I've ever had,"[[VIDEOID:845447c6beecddb11ab6abfb0ae8364d]] Seriously, this is the best straightening tool I've ever owned! My hair has never gotten so straight so quickly without being burned. In the video you can see how quick it goes from damp with a thermal protector in my hair to straight from scalp to end with just a few quick strokes. That probably took me an eighth of the time it normally takes me and that is no joke!<br />I've used hot combs: the ones that you plug in and the old school ones that go straight off the stove on to your hair with embers sparking my hair and everything. I've used ceramic and different metal plated flat irons. I've spent hundreds of dollars on irons and I spent $30 on irons, and this has got to be the most awesome invention for hair straightening yet! I even was desperate enough one time that I used a clothes iron on my hair to get done quicker. It shaved a couple of hours off but wasn't worth the damage and the scalp that I couldn't get that close too.<br />I like how you can see what the temperature is and you can put it on the temperature that you would prefer. It's really easy to read and lots of really bright. The buttons are easy to push and are clearly labeled. Don't be alarmed when you first look at the bristles. It doesn't look like it would come very well because it looks so rubbery, but it really does a great job. As you can see in the video, I still brushed before I used the straightening brush, only because I wanted to have is a little heat on my hair as possible and I didn't want to be worrying about tangles. That's another thing, when I straighten my hair, I go back and forth constantly with a brush or comb and the flat iron to make sure I'm not heating the hair in a awkward position. This took the need of that intermediate comb or brush between the heat process. It made it so much quicker and I am so happy to have this brush!<br />You can see in the pictures of my daughters hair and in the video how close I'm able to get to the scalp. It works so well and it's really convenient. The only thing that I would change is how hot the back of the brush gets. It's hard to figure out how to play put it down without having a holder available. I put it on a towel on the bed, and it got pretty hot. So if there was a way for them to put a different material it on the back, it would be absolutely perfect! I definitely can say I highly recommend the straightener and I hope my review helps you in your decision.<br />I received the straightening comb at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fkNGpaaJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fkNGpaaJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fkNGpaaJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ed-R1fpJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ed-R1fpJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ed-R1fpJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UKS17EwAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UKS17EwAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UKS17EwAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01728D3RY,B01728D3RY,AF4VM4BFDGDLI5H6ATMM7BYZJ3VA,1450245099000,53,False

I've never had a cavity and I didn't want to lose any sensitivity but I was willing to take a risk because of years of coffee drinking and previous years of smoking have really taken a toll on my teeth. These are really nice and that they had a flight minty flavor as opposed to others that I have tried that have a weird chemical taste. The gel didn't glide around my teeth and it stayed in place really well. I was able to read to my kids before bed without them even noticing. I even actually forgot that they were on my teeth! I'm very pleased with the results even with one use. One picture is with just brushing my teeth in the morning another is with the strips in my mouth, you can hardly tell they're there, and the last is the results of one session on my teeth.

I also love it's one tube rather than multiple tubes I have to juggle in my hand. Maybe this means it won't last as long but I replace my mascara a frequently anyways. It had no strange smell like one brand I tried before. It wasn't as flakey as the other brand either.

5.0,They smell amazing and left my skin feeling very soft!!,"First of the bath bomb set by Calily comes with 6 HUGE bath bombs, each one is a different scent. Upon using the first bath bomb, I decided to use the revive bomb since I was already feeling so tired and needed a perk me up. The revive bath bomb is a green in color, smells amazing and left my skin feeling soft ( not greasy). When you put the bath bomb in the water, it began to fizz and makes small bubbles, its a pretty neat &#34;bath show&#34;. Once the bath bomb has completely dissolved, the bath water was the same color, which i really enjoyed. My bath water was a greenish color it reminded me of a nice Florida springs, it helped to relax me even more. relaxation for me is hard to achieve, I have 4 kids, so just being able to take a bath is a nice outlet, the bath bombs added to that experience for me!

5.0,Works great and is chemical free.,"I bought this makeup remover because I wanted something different than the disposable wipes that I was using.  I like that this towel is chemical free and much cheaper than continuing to by packages of wipes. I have seen a similar product on sale in stores for a lot more money so I decided to try this one. It's very soft. I love the way it feels against my skin. I really like that I can use it and then hang it up to dry and reuse it for about a week before I toss it in the washing machine. After it dries, it is still soft unlike a regular washcloth that gets hard and stiff. It does get makeup marks on it, especially from my mascara, but they come out in the wash.  I was curious as to whether the towel actually took off all of my makeup when compared to a prepackaged wipe so I used a wipe after I used this makeup remover. There was very little makeup on the wipe. I was very pleasantly surprised. I also like that the makeup remover is rectangular instead of the small square shape that some of the similar products are. It has more surface area which makes it easier to remover my makeup. The only thing that I wish this one had is a small loop at one end to hang it up by. Right now I just hang it over my towel rack to dry. I was able to try this makeup remover ata discounted price in return for fair and honest feedback.

They are a great alternative to ziplock bags while traveling.<br /><br />I hate ""living"" out of ziplock bags when on vacation so in the past, I would unpack EVERY item, find a place for it on the hotel bathroom counter and stuff the ziplock bags into a suitcase pocket to reuse on the return flight.<br /><br />Now I don't have to do that.

Lavender is one of the most popular scents for use around the home and is really good to use in making various home green cleaning and beauty recipes. This oil comes in a brown glass bottle with a glass dropper and rubber and plastic lid that can be exchanged for the plain lid that it comes with. The smell on this is very potent which is good so when you mix it with other carrier oils or soaps it doesn't get lost in those. My mom liked using this as a perfume while she was here visiting me as well. The scent is exactly what you would expect it to smell like for lavender and I feel it is not synthetic as I am sensitive to man made fragrances and they tend to get my allergies going. I could smell this without any allergic reactions leading me to believe that it truly is all natural.,[],B01IG41ZG4,B01IG41ZG4,AHN7RHYL4Q44AVXEIW5GHACX2IBA,1471197723000,0,False
4.0,"Easy to put into the hair, comes with everything you need except pliers.","I purchased these at a discount to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. These come as one big grouping rubber banded at the top together. I marked this down a star for two reasons, one I wish the color groupings were banded separately because trying to pick through and find just the one (or ones you want) only made us tangle the hair more and we had to stop and comb it to untangle it. Having them packaged separately instead as one big grouping would have saved us this trouble. The other reason is because the colored crimp rings that come with them has a clear plastic or rubber ring inside them that must be removed for the extension to fit through. The instructions said nothing about this and I was getting frustrated on the first one I did thinking it wasn't going to fit until I knocked that clear inside ring out of the way and then it worked fine. Neither of these are deal breakers for potentially buying these for my teen in the future again, but they would be nice improvements!<br /><br />This came with three colors of crimp beads which is nice for different colors of hair to help blend it into the roots. Everything you need is included except a pair of pliers which most households have in their basic or crafting tool kits. I put one in my teenaged daughters hair to show her how to do it, and after that she found it easy enough to do in both her and other peoples hair. They go in and seem pretty durable since they are synthetic. The color will last longer than a real dye job will. The colors are bright and fun. She has brushed and washed her hair multiple times without any issues with the extension.",[],B00MIH1AIO,B00MIH1AIO,AHN7RHYL4Q44AVXEIW5GHACX2IBA,1465865601000,0,False
5.0,"It all metal, easy to sanitize and actually works to push my cuticles back.","I received this cuticle pusher for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. So I was a bit skeptical about this cuticle pusher because all I have ever used are the bamboo stick ones which dull very quickly and it seems I'm always purchasing, the cost was adding up so I haven't bought them in awhile and try to make do with what I have. This did seem like a bit much to pay for, but when you think about what you are saving in costs of disposables and how many years this one will last you it is not as bad as I had thought. Now prices always change on here so it may be a different amount when you look into purchasing it so just do the same thing, weigh the cost of buying disposables with how much it is currently selling for.<br /><br />Now when it arrived it came in a plastic slip cover that you can keep it clean while being stored. It's simple and cheap, but I didn't mark it down because it's considered packaging. Something a little more durable would have been good. I'm not sure how long it will last before it starts to tear at the seams from taking the pusher in and out.<br /><br />The pusher itself is all metal which is really nice as it means you can toss it in the dishwasher or a pot of boiling water to sanitize it often which is a good idea since it's not disposable and your hands, especially your nails carry a ton of germs! The end is flat enough and slightly rounded or smoothed off at the end so that it does not feel sharp against your skin at all. I was worried since I'm used to softer wood that the metal would be painful to use but it really hasn't been each time I've used it. It will work on the cuticles themselves, but I highly recommend soaking your hands in a bit of warm/hot (what you can tolerate or enjoy) slightly soapy water with a few drops of essential oil (again of your liking) in it for some moisturizing and cleaning. This will help to soften them up and make them easier to slide back. Once your done put a bit of oil or other cuticle moisturizer or cream on to keep them feeling good! Whenever you use lotion make sure to rub a bit into the cuticles to keep them feeling soft and good, or if you really have the time use the specialized cuticle creams or lotions every day on them!<br /><br />Once I'm done if I had washed my hands really well and soaked them I might not sanitize this each time like you really should, but I will every few uses or if I picked it up and just started pushes at my dry cuticles without thinking about it or washing my hands!",[],B01CURASWA,B01CURASWA,AHN7RHYL4Q44AVXEIW5GHACX2IBA,1459786988000,1,False
5.0,"Thought I was buying it for my kids, but my husband loves it!","I received this hairbrush for free to try and review; regardless this is mine and my husbands 100% honest opinion. So I got the polka dot brush figuring it would be good for either of my kids. However when it came it was immediately claimed by my husband. Just a few days before we had been discussing my brush that he uses as well and how he uses it but it wasn't exactly what he wanted. Funny this would come days later and it totally was what he was thinking when we had that discussion without knowing I had ordered it!<br /><br />He likes that it fits in the palm of his hand nicely and is comfortable to control around his head. He has shorter hair that is slightly curly, he likes that this brush has short hard plastic bristles that manages his hair without causing static. It also brushes his hair easily into the directions he wants it to go when he is styling it. He doesn't have long hair that tangles so he can't say how it works there, but he really likes how it works on his short hair.<br /><br />Since he couldn't answer that I tried it and had my 6th grade son try it in his hair that is longer. The sides are buzzed, but the top section is several inches long and can fit into pony tails. It brushed both of our hair well and worked good on our tangles without hurting our head or pulling the hairs out as we went through our hair.

While it definitely  cleans  the skin it is a low lather soap. You do not  get a lot of bubbles. There are three  different  types  of  oils  in this body wash  coconut, argan, and tea tree. They work  well in terms  of moisturization. One of my favorite  features  is the pump that is included  to dispense the soap. It is really  well  made. It doesn't  allow  for any drips and dispenses  accurately.

It is a drier consistency  and is easy to apply. I just dumped  some in my hand and gently  massaged it into my skin. It leaves your skin hydrated  and soft.

4.0,Decent  day time  solution,"I have the shortest, thinnest  eyelashes  ever. I constantly  use gobs of mascara to make  them thicker and longer. So when  I was  offered  to  review  this  product  for a  discount  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I jumped on it. This serum comes packaged  nicely and the bottle  seemed on the small side. I opened and tested  it on the back of my knee. No irritation  at all. So before  I went to sleep  I put it on my eye lashes  and brows. When I woke  up I didn't  see a difference. I decided  to try it in the morning  under my makeup. It made my eyebrows  super defined and they laid perfectly  through the day. It also made  my mascara  lay well and my eye lashes  appeared longer. I will continue  to  use  it  and see what happens.",[],B011ZAUS3C,B011ZAUS3C,AE53545QTFI7RPWHC2BSGOAD3NYA,1443479574000,0,False
4.0,Dead Sea Delight,First  of all I am a huge fan of masks. I buy them all of the time. I have tried different  brands  from your dollar ones all the way to paying  $200 for one in a spa. So when  I  got  the  opportunity  to  review  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review  I was in. Let me say that  I liked the scent  which  is kind  of important  because  you  have  to  leave  this  mask on for at least 7 minutes. Next the color is dark  and the consistency  is lighter than what is typical. This means that a little  will go along way. It didn't  get too tight and was easy to remove. I used it both on my face and my cellulite  areas. It felt good  and I had no irritation. It definitely  made my face soft and bright. My makeup  also laid nicely. As far  as  the  cellulite  it didn't  melt  away. I am going  to continue  regulated use and see what  happens.,[],B013HR1A92,B013HR1A92,AE53545QTFI7RPWHC2BSGOAD3NYA,1443130162000,0,False

This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don't. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It's to faint for me.

It helps in some ways more than a brush, I guess. It does pull out less hair than a brush, at least. But the bristles are actually very painful, and it is very loud. It is not nearly as effective as she showed in her video. The screw in batteries are annoying as well. Her hair is also not really tangled, just tussled. Mine is always tangled out of the shower since covid. And with true tangles, it kind of just stops working when you hit it on a snag/tangle.

1.0,Only for toddlers and a lot of flaws,"This little brush is the perfect size for a purse.  I love to use boar bristle brushes in my hair because of the shine it gives me.  I tried to run this brush through my hair and the bristles are not dense enough to go through any hair except that of a toddler.  I wish that I could actually pull this brush completely through my hair but it just isn't happening.  I was also disappointed that the item had a sticker on the back and when I pulled it off it was sticky so my hair got caught in it.  Lastly, this brush just came as it was with a sticker.  There was no packaging around it and I'm a little grossed out that plenty of hands have touched my new hairbrush.  I am so disappointed.<br /><br />I purchased this travel size boar bristle hair brush at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it.

3.0,"No growth, but an ok hair treatment","I have actually tried the daelong shampoo and conditioner (with poor results in the growth category).  When I saw that there was also a treatment cream I decided to give it a go.  My thoughts on this hair growth treatment cream are a mixed bag. I like the scent of it a lot. I like that it isn't too heavy on my hair, glides easily and softens my hair after I've used the shampoo. I don't feel like it's causing any grease or oil on my hair.  The container is also HUGE.  This is easily the size of 3 regular containers of intense conditioner.  The only problem I have (the bottle is pretty too) is that I can't really tell that my hair is growing faster than it was with other hair products. I see no difference in my hair length.  I just don't. My hair feels a little more healthy but nothing substantial. I would pay around $14 for this hair growth treatment because I do like the smell and it doesn't make my hair unhealthy. I just don't see the results I expected. I give it 3 stars for being a good conditioner but had to knock off two stars because I'm not seeing growth.<br /><br />The jar is an amusing shower read.  Enjoy it!<br /><br />I purchased this daelong hair growth treatment cream at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it.

4.0,Great for thin hair!,"As someone with thin hair, it is difficult for me to find styling tools that work for me without flattening the small amount of volume my hair will carry. I've done a video review so you can see this brush in action, but I find that this is an ideal brush for thin hair and people who hate to spend time doing their hair and generally prefer to walk out the door in a bun or ponytail. It took me about a minute to complete my full head of hair and look walk out the door ready.<br /><br />Pros to this straightening brush:<br />*cost effective<br />*easy to hold<br />*instructions are simple to read and easy to implement<br />*Works very well<br />*whole head ready to go in one minute<br />*fast heat up<br />*pretty in pink<br />*easy to read temperature gauge<br /><br />Cons:<br />*may pull some hair<br />*could scorch hair if hair is not completely dry when using<br />*easy to burn hands, be very careful<br />*over time may not be as hair friendly as other hair straightening brushes<br /><br />Overall, this is a great value and I plan to continue using it.

5.0,This stuff is the best,"It has this not quite oily, not quite greasy feel, but thick and slippery enough that it just glides right onto your skin.  A much needed lubricant after a close shave.  It dries without residues or greasy feelings too and it smells very nice, my wife loves it and says she prefers this scent to my normal cologne.  I may have to pony up the dough to buy this stuff in cologne too, but with the price that I have to pay for it, Im glad I only have to buy it twice a year.  You really only use like a pea sized dab, where as I had to use 2-3 times as much with my previous aftershave, a gillete lotion.

4.0,Not too shabby,"Honestly these aren’t bad at all, the only negative things I have to say mostly has to do with my own preferences. I personally like to start my eyeliner in the middle of my eyelid and do a wing rather than have it going all the way across my eyelid, so with the wideness of these lashes (the band is quite thick), I either have to do the full lid or trim them to where I can only stick it to the outer corners of my eyes. Other than that I’m very satisfied, it does smell a lot like cheap old lady perfume and if ur prone to headaches from strong scents I can see it becoming a problem.

4.0,Good Purchase,"I was skeptical about this cleansing brush because it didn’t have the shape that could get into crevices. I’m glad I got over it. I’ve been using this and an older model I bought years ago and this one wins hands down. I don’t really have acne. My issues are t-zone congestion and my skin’s texture isn’t smooth. I’m in my mid 30s so I’m trying to get on the anti-aging boat lol. I really like that this has a heat feature. However, It takes about 1 minute 30<br />seconds to heat up so I’ll let it run and do something else. Wen it shuts off then I turn it on again and actually use it. Also the heat is mild. The device makes my skin super smooth and is gentle on the skin. I have combo/normal skin and I can’t stop touching my face. I wake up the next morning and my skin is still smooth. I started using it once a day, then twice a day but switched to once every three days on the lowest setting. My skin is still smooth so I don’t want to overdo it. You will see redness but it goes away fairly quickly. I wet my face, I wet the device and add my cleanser directly it. You can use less cleanser because the device distributes it nicely. This seems to work best with a cream cleanser. It stays on for 2 minutes but 1 minute should suffice. It doesn’t have a beep to let you know when to switch sections. The last setting that dries the device is a nice touch. I only get water on the bristles so I can’t speak on it being waterproof.  I’m thinking of purchasing another one for when the current one needs replacing. This device either has a 1 year warranty which is wonderful.

(1) yes, it will activate the peeling of a layer or two, and usually with in a couple of days, (2) product design is a bit cumbersome to use (a plastic bag bootie that has the ooze inside that is a bit of a struggle to get on your foot, and (3) because the goo inside is all over the plastic bootie, it not only gets on the bottom of your feet, but all over your entire foot (bottom, top, ankle, etc.).  As a result of #3, not only did my entire foot feel tight and tingly for days, but the product created a very irritable rash on the tops of my feet. The rash has been there all week and still hasn't subsided.  This would be a much better product if you could just put it on the bottoms of your feet or where the dry/calloused skin is.  If I every use it again, I will put it on a plastic mat or something and just allow the bottoms of my feet to be exposed to the goo or rub it on the needed areas with a plastic glove.  NEVER again will I put it on as a sock/bootie and now I just hope the tops of my feet heal.

5.0,Amazing shampoo and conditioner! I highly suggest for curly haired people.,"I was totally blown away by this shampoo and conditioner, especially considering I had never heard of this brand before. Let me assure you, this stuff is AH-mazing! And not only that, it's curly girl approved! Allow me to give you some background on my hair type before I review the shampoo and conditioner individually. I have very long, very thick, highly porous, somewhat dry, very frizzy, naturally curly hair. My curly hair type is about a 3A/3B. Now about the shampoo. The shampoo is completely sulfate and silicone free (I don't use sulfates or silicones in my hair), and while washing my hair the very first time, it actually felt like it was moisturizing my hair while actually getting it clean, and not stripping my hair at all. Like, that's quite a trifecta! I've found that a lot of sulfate free shampoos don't leave your hair feeling quite clean, but this one really does. That shampoo doesn't smell like much, it smells fresh, but doesn't have a powerful odor at all. The conditioner, however, is amazing! I wasn't expecting much from it because it has so few ingredients, which are mostly oils, but holy cow, this stuff felt amazing on my hair! A lot of silicone free conditioners don't have much slip, so it makes detangling your hair in the shower a bit difficult, but this was super easy, my fingers glided right through my hair, my hair felt silky, and best of all, it didn't take a ton of product to achieve this effect like it does with a lot of conditioners. The conditioner definitely has more of an herbal scent to it, but it's a pleasant one that I enjoy, and I don't think it's objectionable to anyone. All this being said, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this shampoo and conditioner set, I think I'm a convert for life!<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.**",[],B01GOWKAD4,B01GOWKAD4,AEV62OQOWLS2M6YJP55PDT525INQ,1467063661000,6,False

5.0,"Some of the best scents in the game, great hold and consistency.","I didn’t buy from amazon I bought straight from The Original Lumberjack website and I got all 4 scent samples. First off they have some of the best smelling beard grease(balm) ive tried and I’ve tried a good dozen brands. Their spice scent is legit heaven. Probably my favorite but all their scents are amazing. I’d have to rank spice as my #1 though it smells like a good fall season scent which I love #2 is a tie between the other 3 scents(black tie, whiskey tobacco, and wilderness)  becuase they’re just so good and I like them all equally and that’s rare, usually I’ll only like 1 or 2 scents from a company. I’m picky. The feel to the beard grease is also high quality it’s a thick creamy consistency that melts in your hands fast and isn’t real greasy which is ironic since the name would imply that it would be greasy. It seems to make my beard look more dense and thick as well. The hold is great it lays my beard better than all the others and that’s just the original compound so I bet rugged hold version is even better on taming which I’m gonna try and write a review on. Also the package arrived way faster than I expected it to which is a plus. I took the time to review them because I genuinely love their products and they have great customer service. I have nothing negative to say or any constructive criticism because everything is done right by this company. 5 star on everything for them. Also if you buy from their website you get free shipping if you spend $15. This is my new favorite brand and I plan on buying their entire product line.",[],B079QW8TSQ,B079QW8TSQ,AEGEFE4BHBNHROHIWFKJAMOYYI2Q,1562874800020,0,False

5.0,Great little ribbons,"I bought these gymnastic rhythmic color ribbons mostly because I had one when I was little and it was one of my favorite things to play with, and I really thought our worship team at church would like to use them for some of our vacation Bible school songs. They loved them! The kids loved them! And I loved getting to relive my childhood by playing with them when they weren’t in use. I didn’t read the description very closely, because they are shorter than I expected, but that’s my fault….the listing clearly says they are 39 inches, which they are. Actually that worked out better for the worship team than long ones since they are all standing on stage, close to each other.<br />The colors are not what I was expecting, they are much better. They come in random colors and we got gold, red, blue, green and hot pink. They are much brighter and more vibrant than the pictures would lead you to believe.<br />I really like that the handle has some weight to it. It didn’t come into play for our purposes, but if you’re doing gymnastics, having the weight in the handle makes tosses much more predictable.

The ones I didn't deliberately remove are still going strong after five days (and I've even tried scrubbing them to see how much would come off). I put one on my face which I removed with rubbing alcohol - the removal cloths that came with them had a really strong solvent odor so I didn't want to rub it on my face. Even baby oil didn't take these off, which is a go to for most temporary tattoos. Don't put these anywhere you don't want people to see them or are unwilling to scrub vigorously with alcohol or nail polish remover. Colors and metallics are really vibrant for days.

All in all - I wouldn't buy it again because I really don't like how tightly curled/frizzy it is - some may like this look.

4.0,Bad seal,"I got this grapefruit scrub a few days ago. I will have to say the size is smaller than I expected. I did not pay attention on the size when I made the order. But it is smaller than when most scrubs I used to see in the store. The packaging is ok. The seller tried to protect the item in the box. However, the bottle I got is either opened before or not sealed well. The oil inside is leaking. I have to clean the bottle before I put it on my table. I am disappointed on this situation. Not enough oil is left inside to keep the sea salt moist. And when I opened the scrub, the smell of grapefruit is not strong and is not natural. It is not smells like natural fruit. It is ok for me since the smell will not stay anyway after I clean my skin after apply it. The good part I like of this scrub is that after apply it, I do feel my skin is more smooth. Right now, the sea salt in my bottle is kind of dry because of the oil leak. Maybe it will be better if you luckily get a good one. However, you need to pay attention that this product is not that gentle to the skin. I do not recommend using this product on our very soft and sensitive area. It will be good for hands, knees, feet and maybe legs. BUT NOT FACE even though it says for body and face. I will not use it on my face. When applying it on the skin, please do it very gentle so it does not hurt. Overall, this is an average performed body scrub. But for this price, I feel it is a bit over priced compared to what I can buy from TjMaxx.<br />I purchased this product at a free/discounted price in return for an honest testing and evaluation review.

I've been using mascara for 35 years and never had one of these that was spring-loaded but this is nice;  it helps me curl my lashes quickly since I have no patience to stand there for long periods of time to make sure the curl is just right.  The extra little finger grip is good for making sure I have more precision when I'm using it, too.  The plastic thing to keep it closed when not in use seems sturdy enough.

2.0,Palm oil - pore clogging - failed applicator,"Not so good: Tube design failed, pore clogging, not 2-in-1<br />Good: color<br />Unknown: lasting?<br /><br />I was glad I read a few reviews before I opened it, then I opened it carefully, pushed gently, and it burst out the sides all the same. I wasn't sure if it was because the on/off was marked on the lid but not the tube, maybe I just turned it the wrong amount? ½ turn seemed reasonable, so I turned it tighter and more came out the sides. For what it's worth, the instructions just have us dabbing a couple dots on with the sponge and blending with the fingers or brush. The sponge is an entirely unnecessary addition.<br /><br />As you can see from the photo, this did allow me to put a nice and thick layer on my arm just in case anyone is looking to see how dramatic it can be. I do like the color, it's a good match, but I wouldn't use it on my eyes or my lips because the product says 'liquid blush.' There is a graphic on this page that says 2-in-1, despite showing eyes/blush/lips on the very same graphic, which I am pretty sure would be 3-in-1.<br /><br />The last issue is the ingredients. The top ingredient is Ethylhexyl Palmitate, which is a pretty well known comedogenic (pore clogging) problem, so it's not great if you have breakouts. That's why I don't know how long it lasts or well it holds up over time, it's not worth the high risk of breakouts so I didn't wear it long. You might have guessed that 'palmitate' is also a derivative of Palm Oil, which is an industry that is destroying many biodiverse forests.<br /><br />Two stars for color, texture feels nice, but I would only recommend this to people with clear skin that don't really have any desire to use the applicator sponge.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518vv4LeB-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518vv4LeB-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518vv4LeB-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Qz4cY8BWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Qz4cY8BWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Qz4cY8BWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612dqlLGy7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612dqlLGy7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612dqlLGy7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QgbunhHFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QgbunhHFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QgbunhHFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j2jp54zpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j2jp54zpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j2jp54zpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BNGZK9ZH,B0BX53H8XD,AFQOTCWHOUNSIKPQ4P74PPGXOMEA,1676614315588,0,False

4.0,Working well for my moisturizer,"I got this to apply moisturizers and toners that come in liquid form and are sometimes sort of awkward to apply. This method seems less wasteful than a cotton ball. So far, this is working pretty well for that purpose.<br /><br />The jade ball is nice. The bottle looks like glass but I think it's a thick plastic and it has measurements listed on the side. The black top is plastic, and I'm hoping that holds up, it might be a little thin where the roller is. Where you screw and unscrew it, that feels a little weak. So far it's holding up okay, though. There's also a clear plastic lid. The product page seems pretty serious about keeping the bottle stored upright, but the box doesn't mention that. I can see how fluid would come out though, so I'm not pressing it.<br /><br />This seems pretty good for my needs and I'd recommend it.

In order for the vacum to work there is a plastic vacum ""sleeve"" or ""guard"" that goes up to the teeth.  The other reviewers complained about close trimming without the full guard and I do agree that it is awkward to pull down the vacuum sleeve for a close trim but I found that on both this model and my old one, the teeth on the trimmer were too big for a comfortable close trim anyway, so I do not use that feature.  I instead use a fine tooth slid-up trimmer on another shaver for that.  I disagree with the noise complaints, I thought the vacuum was only slightly louder than the actual trimmer and there was plenty of suction at the lower setting, which you can't hear over the trimmer.

After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* It gives a great shave! They've changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.<br /><br />* It's quiet. I can actually have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn't possible with my older shaver.<br /><br />* It is significanly lighter than my older model.<br /><br />* Cleanup is really easy. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you're supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.<br /><br />* It's hard to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you'll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This isn't nearly as handy.<br /><br />* The shape isn't as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it's wet. It doesn't feel very good in your hand.<br /><br />* There is no case to store it in. This is a drawback if you use it to travel.<br /><br />* The head is supposed to be replaced once a year. Huh??? This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers. These heads aren't cheap, folks. I certainly wouldn't replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I'd probably buy a new one.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'm very pleased with this shaver.

4.0,"Works with a little elbow grease, FAINT results","You really have to work at this to make sure you get a result, and you must be careful that you got equal amounts of each solution on the cotton swab. I accidentally got too much of Solution B, and got a negative result on something I knew had nickel. Also, you have to really rub hard for 15+ seconds, and then you see a FAINT, faint pink on the cotton swab. It's very subtle.<br /><br />It would have been helpful if the makers included something to use as a ""positive control"", something that contained nickel so you could see what a positive test looks like and know what you're looking for while testing unknown items. I highly suggest that users find their own positive control - find something you know has nickel, and test that to see the pink and know you're doing it right.<br /><br />Also, this seems to release ammonia gas when the solutions are mixed, so use in a well-ventilated area, and don't put your face right over the swab or item being tested or you'll get a whiff of ammonia in your nose/eyes.<br /><br />As it turns out, real surgical grade stainless steel does test NEGATIVE for nickel! (And I tried really, really hard to get a result on that one!)

5.0,Amazing! They really do remove makeup with just water.,"I will admit I was extremely skeptical of the claim that these cloths could remove makeup with just water but they do! I would even go as far to say that they do a better job than a cotton cloth with soap on it. I have sensitive skin so using harsh soaps or cleansers is not an option for me. Typically I would struggle to get my mascara completely removed. I would always end up with raccoon eyes requiring me to scrub harder than I would like on the delicate skin below my eyes and I don’t even use waterproof mascara. That problem is a thing of the past now that I have these washcloths. I am able to remove all my makeup with minimal effort and no scrubbing.<br /><br />The cloths are very soft and feel good against your skin whether they are wet or dry. I used one the other day as a sweat rag while I was working out because they are so absorbent; it worked great. The stitching looks solid and they have a nice thick feel to them. I haven’t been using them long enough to run them through the wash but they feel very well made so I am not worried about them falling apart in the wash. I thought they would collect so much makeup that I would need to wash them after almost every use but that is not the case a quick rinse in clean water and they are good to go.<br /><br />The color is true to the picture displayed although I would call it closer to sea foam green than blue.<br /><br />My only complaint is I could do without the rather large tag that stretches across the corner. I will probably look at the stitching a little closer to see if I can safely remove it without ruining them.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

This item is visually larger in diameter.<br /><br />I only used one long enough to get it stuck and unstuck.

I returned those and now I got these 4 days later.  I ordered the blue-colored rods to be delivered to me. I was told that the color is random, the size is what matters. I measured the new rod diameter and it's approx. 9mm diameter.<br /><br />Instead of these, I ordered small, yellow, straight, plastic rods.

5.0,All the strength of traditional arylic without the bulk or salon. Stronger and easier DIY then gel,"I have always coveted long nails, but with weak, bendy nails that peal and break easily it was never achievable. I'm a DIY girl when it comes to nails. I have been doing my own gel manicures for years and most recently have been using Brisa lite smoothing gel for added strength. It helped but manicures still started chipping at the 10 day mark and as soon as my nails got to the desired length they would start breaking.<br />By comparison this stuff is amazing! Its all the strength without the bulk of regular acrylic. They are my real nails but nothing will break them.The process itself is faster since you don't have to cure for two minutes each time. The coats between and after powder are just thin glue. Its also more forgiving as the coats are all even and solidly applied. You buff and clean up in the middle of the process which makes everything even and your edges perfect. I've also filed and such after they are done without issue.<br />I actually ordered from Revel itself, but read the reviews here first. Revel colors are also cheaper then gel's options, with a one ounce jar of color only costing about $8. One ounce jar is probably like 8-10 manicures. Sure beats paying a salon $40 every two weeks.<br />Removal is slightly different. I use the cotton ball with nail caps method and find it slightly more time consuming then gel, but I think that's only because I'm still getting used to it. When exposed to acetone the dip turns into a chewed gum consistency. So unlike my CND shellac that peals off I'm rubbing off sticky blobs. But I also probably just need to try soaking it an extra 5 minutes and stop being impatient.<br />But the extra removal time is totally worth it when you consider the manicures last longer, are stronger, and allow me to finally have my dream long nails.",[],B01C7532DM,B01C7532DM,AHJOWKLJYQT4VSNUO5HLEKRVOHZA,1531407336702,1,False

To clean it out, the head can be twisted and popped off, then cleaned out with a brush included in the battery compartment. (Turns out the Panasonic's head also twists off for better cleaning access, but I never knew that until I tried it tonight.)<br /><br />Of the two, the Maswater runs more quickly than the Panasonic on the same AA battery, which is good for finishing promptly. The Maswater also includes a very dim built-in LED light, though I couldn't imagine that helping me in any way while trimming hairs from either my nose or ears.<br /><br />The real test will be how long the Maswater continues to run quickly.

5.0,"Durable bamboo handle paired with a soft bristled brush, stop the plastic. Buy.","Pros:<br />One of the oldest known types of toothbrushes<br />Sustainable bamboo instead of plastic<br />Environmentally friendly toothbrush<br />Super soft modern nylon bristles<br />Biodegradable bamboo handle<br />Smaller ecological footprint<br />Bamboo grows very fast<br />Strong and durable<br />Ecological<br />Cute<br /><br />Cons:<br />Synthetic bristles<br />Still will likely end up in a landfill<br />Premium price for handmade toothbrush<br /><br />Bamboo bristle toothbrushes have historically been one of the oldest known toothbrushes, having originated out-of-China, over (500) years ago (Library of Congress). The bristles were made from boars’ hair and the handle from bamboo. Nylon bristles came about around 1938. Today, some toothbrushes still use boar’s bristles, however, some say there are concerns about the action of the natural bristles on the enamel and gums, so many still recommend soft nylon bristles. Here, we have a natural bamboo handle, which is sturdy and durable, with little to no bend and very smooth, so someone took time to sand this down. The bristles are very soft. Which is easy on the gums and enamel. The toothbrush head and handle are perfect for a little one’s mouth, allowing access to those small to reach places. Practicing good oral hygiene is so important, at a young age. Our little one found this toothbrush perfect in size to maneuver about and the bristles comfortable. We see no shedding of a single bristle at this early stage; and plan to rotate this out of commission, after its effectiveness appears of concern, after a bad cold, or just after so many months of service. With that in mind, cost is always a concern. These are no bargain basement toothbrushes. They are a premium product in our opinion and are priced accordingly.  Bamboo toothbrush handles can be composted, used as kindling, and can be repurposed for other household uses. However, just like plastic toothbrush handles, they will take up space in a landfill if just thrown away. We reconsidered using plastic toothbrushes, and now choose bamboo toothbrushes as an alternative to the plastic, which ends up in landfills. Plastic is not designed to break down and plastic toothbrushes are difficult to recycle. We decided bamboo to be an excellent alternative to reduce plastic waste at home. Finally, our little one gave this bamboo toothbrush, with its cute design laser burned into the handle two (2) thumbs up for fit, having that fun handle design, unique style, soft bristle comfort, lack of odor, and ease of using. We agree.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QyTe8m9BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QyTe8m9BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QyTe8m9BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h3e3tYhwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h3e3tYhwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61h3e3tYhwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi350FlJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi350FlJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mi350FlJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HPUpSVXGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HPUpSVXGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HPUpSVXGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a2nbep8iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a2nbep8iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81a2nbep8iL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cFXpn0DIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cFXpn0DIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cFXpn0DIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jK4mRE5CL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jK4mRE5CL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jK4mRE5CL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sGkjwxaxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sGkjwxaxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sGkjwxaxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B093CPFRHJ,B093CPFRHJ,AEDVEEUD4NZX7NYETDDN5N3HBJEA,1659780594402,0,False

5.0,Reliable Company - Very Handy and Useful Iron,Update: Olaxer replaced my wand free of charge and this one arrived intact. I've given it a few weeks to ensure it didn't fall apart and so far so good. I can't find another wand that makes my bangs look like they have body without actually curling them under so I am so happy that Olaxer stands behind their products and makes it right. The straightener works great to tame the cowlick and frizzies. I was so excited that it has the straightener built in so I don't have to plug in multiple devices on those days my cowlick is outta control!<br /><br />When it arrived the piece holding the cord was broken. But that didn't really harm anything so I just took it completely off and used it anyway. I'm lazy so I rarely use the straightener although it is nice when I am having a particularly frizzy day. I love the size of the wand it gives just the right amount of curl to keep my bangs from laying flat against my head.<br />I rated it two stars because even with little use the clip that holds the flattening part together so I can use the want has broken. I should have guessed it was cheaply made when the other clip thing came off.

3.0,Not bad but not great,"I was so hesitant to buy an item that had no reviews but I've been in search of a bag like this for a long time. Price point is great. Leather feels fairly soft for the price, not a super shiny finish which is what I wanted. The quality seems decent. I have one concern and one problem. Concern is that the straps will deteriorate over time with all the sliding through the metal D rings that they do. Can't confirm that'll happen but given my one or two days of use that's a concern I have. The problem I have is that the shape of the bag itself is tapered at the top. So the measurement of the bag's width is not consistent through the whole height of the and thus the opening of the bag. This makes my iPad (in a case) very tricky to get in and out. Also a problem with the top of this bag is it's zippered closure, which is a bit flimsy; I just chose not to use it at all. These two issues were deal breakers for me; I'll have to return. If I was just using it as a purse I'd be able to keep it but I'd like to fit my iPad, possibly a couple of diapers, kid stuff, etc. it's just too small and restricting for that type of use.",[],B016EE9AKQ,B016EE9AKQ,AFMFMXUIBJHO7NBN6XISUHJV3UYA,1475320968000,3,True

This results in one side of the band presseing painfully into the bone behind my left ear (rather than resting by the soft, cartilage area behind the ear, where normal length head bands don't create any discomfort).<br /><br />3. Even the shorter side of the headband is too long for me, but the longer side is so long that it just sticks out into space. Since I wear my hair up this is decidedly unattractive, not to mention uncomfortable.<br /><br />4. I was really hoping there would be more teeth.

5.0,"Xara 1"" Infrared professional ceramic curling iron - Love it!","I recently purchased this curling iron based on what other reviewers had to say.  I am very happy that I did.  I have recently gone back to work in an office after several years of working from home.  This means I actually have to do my hair more often.  After several mornings of burning my fingers, I ditched it for a new one.  And I can't get used to the gloves that you can buy to help prevent that (and never got any with that curling iron).<br />I am so happy with this purchase for a few reasons so far...I have not burned my fingers!!  That's a pretty big reason for me!!  I did receive gloves with this and I am thinking of trying them, they seem to be a better material that the ones I had before, so maybe I will get used to them.  But so far, the tip hasn't gotten so hot that it burns me.  Secondly, I like the temperature adjustment on this because you actually 'click' it with a button, the Baby Bliss has a dial which can easily get bumped during styling (making it too hot!)  So my temp stays exactly where I want it unless I change it.  And finally, the other main selling point for me was that it uses infrared light!!!  Infrared light is a penetrating light and is actually less damaging.  It isn't just heating the outside of the hair strands, and trust me it helps hold my curls longer.  I am a brunette with med thick hair, but finer strands.  Basically, my hair feels thick, but it's finer hair.  And although I have natural wavy/curly hair, for some bizarre reason, it won't hold a curl from a curling iron all day.  Strange, but true.  Overall, it seems to be a very well constructed curling iron and I am happy I am saving the health of my finger tips and my hair from damage.  I am actually going to see if they make flat irons with the infrared technology to replace my current flat iron that is acting up.",[],B01FYFH044,B01FYFH01W,AF57BPOJFPBWMH4RSVPIBMQ6A5MQ,1479172497000,37,True

The bottle it comes in is incredibly fancy - I'll probably keep it when it empty because the cap looks like the Louvre from underground. The bottle recommends three drops twice a day on your skin, but I just use it once. Since I've been using this formula, I've noticed the lines on my forehead tighten up. Of course, there is no one solution to removing wrinkles and it has to be coupled with other good habits and lotions/formulas, but after over a month of using this in my nightly facial care routine, I'm very happy with the results.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DoTF0751L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DoTF0751L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DoTF0751L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07LGWMPL6,B07LGWMPL6,AFLWPONTDY5SAMCO5RLFXGBVBRDA,1576794806472,0,False

I chose to do this process over the kitchen sink, just in case, and it didn't take long at all, even though I was being overly cautious, not to make a mess. When the entire process was completed, I ended up with only a small amount that got on my hands. Not a big deal, at all. I have one small complaint. When you're finished using the suction tube, there's no real way to clean the tube. I chose to wrap the tube with saran/cling wrap. You could use a Ziploc bag, I'm sure, but yeah, it'd be nice if they included a sealable bag for the tube, for storage in-between use. I chose this brand for two reasons, one, the plastic mascara tube that was included, and two, honestly, I just liked the look of the amber glass bottle. I immediately curled my eyelashes, and then applied this oil to test it out. As I'm writing this, the oil is not bothering my eyes. In the future, I plan to apply it at night, before bed. I'm giving 5 stars, but, will update my review if anything changes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fYJT5jtbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fYJT5jtbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fYJT5jtbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07BPPMGTN,B07BPPMGTN,AHCSXQURYQ6TOFTJJ7NSWR6SHWXA,1536519807728,3,True

That's pretty fantastic, at least for the folks who worry about that stuff. Oh, and I forgot, it's not tested on animals. Another goodie.<br />  Back to the product, it's a thicker consistency than I was expecting. Which turned out to be a good thing. The scrub didn't disapate as quickly as other scrubs I've tried in the past. Which meant even more lather time to really scrub away the troubles of working in freaking customer service all day.<br />  The only con I have is that they could have had more in the packaging.

No lifting, no streaking, no air bubbles etc.<br /><br />Price point is great for the salon grade quality. 5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KCqZikEuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KCqZikEuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KCqZikEuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MoqEupP3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MoqEupP3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MoqEupP3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ki35H7opL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ki35H7opL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ki35H7opL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e0YXB3rCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e0YXB3rCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e0YXB3rCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08L6GXY2S,B08L6GXY2S,AE2RWATLMMUSX7TMKKCP2DYHDCWQ,1610187309413,0,False
2.0,NO ODOR. (did not work for me),"Immediately after opening, I tested the product on my hand (see photo) to see if I would have any type of allergic reaction, stinging, or irritation. After a few minutes, I did not notice any of those.<br /><br />PROS/<br />- NO ODOR! I've tried samples of similar products like this in the past and almost all that I have tried/smelled, all have some type of odor or scent. This product does not which is great!<br />- Packaging is really nice. It comes in a cute box- so if you're gifting, this would be extremely easy to wrap or put in a gift bag.<br />- Definitely giftable! Can totally see this being a great little gift to add to any gift bag or gift box. Would even make a great stocking stuffer this coming holiday season.<br />- Consistency of the liquid is nice- it is not thick, not slimy, not super thin, and not heavy.<br />- Easy to use. The brush is similar to most liquid eyeliner brushes so it is easy to apply on your brows and/or lash line.<br /><br />I have using this for a couple of days now. I have been consistent with it and plan to continue... I haven't quite used it long enough to see ""growth"" or any difference quite yet but I will totally update this when or if I do. Though, my brows and lashes have not fallen out so I guess that is a good thing, huh? I'm sold on the no odor!<br /><br />~UPDATE - 01/14/2020<br />It has now been 2+ months of continuous recommend use and I have NOT seen a difference in eyelash length/growth nor in eyebrows. I guess it is possible that everyone will get different results, but I did not get any.

1.0,Wouldn’t recommend.,"I unfortunately DO NOT like this product. I had high hopes for this but it is just not working for me.<br /><br />I first tried this product on the back of my hand (picture shown)... did different strokes with the pen- lighter stroke and heavier stroke, short and long. IMMEDIATELY, I noticed that the ink bleeds to where you can barely see the lines... ends up looking like a smudged streak.<br /><br />I waited 30 minutes to let the ink set, and quickly ran the back of my hand under cold water. WITHOUT even having to rub the ink (picture shown), the ink quickly faded and was nearly gone. Not sure how “waterproof” this product is.<br /><br />I’ve tried this product on my eyebrows numerous times now, and I just cannot get the ink to not bleed. Also, after applying, it’s very hard to see the lines, still ends up looking smeared. I’ve tried gently gliding the pen and even that does not work.<br /><br />Note/<br />- Pen is easy to hold<br />- Consistency comparison... The ink is “lighter” and thinner than liquid eyeliner<br /><br />This would work for someone who does not want the lines to show or for someone who doesn’t care if the ink bleeds/smudges. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend it. You’re better off flicking a liquid eyeliner pen against your eyebrows.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L9noHcXaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L9noHcXaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L9noHcXaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YW8o4DrRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YW8o4DrRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YW8o4DrRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eYY1znV-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eYY1znV-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61eYY1znV-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lbRo3Gm0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lbRo3Gm0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lbRo3Gm0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Y63PY1M,B07Y63PY1M,AE2RWATLMMUSX7TMKKCP2DYHDCWQ,1600640353571,0,False

1.0,Horrible Product,"Being seasoned for over 15 years in accounting, I purchased this software because “everyone is using it”. First of all, if you want to go out of business then this is the product for you. I will explain how,  payroll calculations are off.  I paid my employees the same amount of salaries for years, switched to QB and the sums have all changed.  To run tax reports off!!!  I’m sure this is done on purpose so you will have to pay for their services. I don’t like the way it try’s to sell me stuff while I am trying to post, unprofessional. Something’s been on mine trying to sell me stuff back from Memorial Day, and sure weird pop ups, buy this now??  Ok the kicker is you can’t make invoices in advanced and when you try it double makes them. It does not tell you when a group of invoices are due, it just tells you all are due; ones  that are already prepaid and posted. Sure send a customer an invoice for services they had already paid for 😬. Plus if you have different amount of set monthly  invoices, let’s say some are $10, 15, 20, you can’t not batch them all together, it all has to be done separate, and if you do it changes everyone’s invoice.  Major pain. It triples invoices all at different amounts, Completely flawed. However,I will tell you what this program is good for, if you do not want to be in control of your payroll and outsource it, all at a fee. If you just want to create invoices on demand and not have any control over your books. It is good if you have no idea what you are doing because neither does it.

The foam washes right off, but leaves a film on your skin that needs rubbed off, so i was glad I had waited to rinse until I was in the shower.<br />The mask did leave my skin looking and feeling refreshed, and a few hours later, my skin is still feeling really soft!

4.0,it really just looks like packed dry brown sugar,"I really did not know what to expect with this scrub, and was very intrigued by the idea of using brown sugar in a scrub. Initially, when I opened the jar, it really just looks like packed dry brown sugar, like you would see when you are baking and measuring it out. The smell is pure sugar, which kind of surprised me, since it has so many different oils in it. But, like I said, it is fairly dry in the jar. It is easy to scoop out, and if you spread it between your hands before scrubbing on your body, it does moisten right up, and the sugar starts to dissolve, which would be why it is such a dry scrub. I was impressed with the soft smoothness of my skin after using the scrub, considering the sugar was dissolving, but it did work. My skin has a faint sweet aroma, but, due to the initial dryness and low oil quantity in the packaging, it did not moisturize as much as I would have liked. This would be great in the spring and summer, but for the dry Iowa winters, I think I will go with something with more oils in it. Overall, nice product, and this company has yet to disappoint!",[],B01LMKB63G,B01LMKB63G,AFRGGNZLI5ZY5T5IMHGYUBPSJ24Q,1478795016000,0,False

1.0,Pack of lies,"So I will admit that the product works well. It does it's job as a body wash. The reason that this is getting one star is due to something I am seeing a few others have noticed. Which is that this bottle does not contain what it is supposed to. I looked up every ingredient listed on the back of this bottle. Some of them are things derived from coconut oil. However actual coconut oil is not an actual ingredient. There is nothing that I can find that says that this stuff has argan oil. Lastly is that supposedly has tea tree oil. I didn't even need to look anything up to know that this body wash does not have it in there. The big one being that, while the soap smells nice, it smells NOTHING like tee tree oil. Tea Tree oil has a very strong and distinct smell. I use it for a lot of stuff, so I know what it smells like. Then there is the fact that based off of glancing at the ingredients. Tea Tree oil is not listed by it's common or scientific name. So unless this company is counting the front of the bottle as part of the ingredients list, this does not contain what it says it does. There ingredients seem natural enough and the ingredients list isn't as long as a lot of soaps, I do not appreciate being mislead and lied to.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Time it lasts: it’s pretty thin/liquidy once you put it on so it comes right off. Again 0/5.<br />3. Tint/Stain on lips: it does stain lips but it’s fairly temporary again due to its consistency. It’s maybe a 2 or 3 out of 5.<br />4. Smell: oh dear lord. It smells awful like chemicals & strong herbs mixed together (I’m not implying that it has chemicals but the smell is just way way off).

It does dye your skin behind the eyebrows but it doesn't last very long, especially if you have a consistent skin care routine and are washing your face twice and and removing makeup.

Yesterday (weeks later), I got an email asking me to review it, so today I decided to try it. I opened the box and the bottle was sealed in plastic and taped. There were gloves with it. I was even more nervous! LOL. I gave my hair a quick wash in the shower (no gloves) and I did have to spray down the whole area, as everything was purple, but it rinsed right off. My hair felt squeaky afterwards (I did not condition) and when I dried it, I did notice that the brassiness was gone. I only left it in my hair for a minute or so while washing. I guess I was scared for nothing. I think I would use it once a week to keep the tone cooler. Scared for nothing, as usual!",[],B074TG7CVH,B074TG7CVH,AF4KBWUJ2NAN7HUTV3L6W23K75DQ,1559226042406,4,True

I thought maybe my hands were just too dry and the dry skin was creating a barrier?!? so I took some of the liquid and tried to rub it on my arm and leg and it still wouldn't absorb. The sticky feeling started getting to me and the smell became overwhelming so I ended up washing it all off. My hands felt drier than before I started but felt like they had some kind of chalky film on them.<br /><br />I work in healthcare and my hands are very dry from washing and sanitizing all day long so I'm constantly searching for ways to pamper my hands since they take a beating.

I’m happy because the back of my ears don’t hurt now since I have to wear a mask at work for 10+ hours.<br />My only complaint is that I’m not a fan of some of the bright neon colors that come in this pack.

Most of the others for the same price was for only one wrap).  As soon as they arrived, I tried them out.  These wraps are medium density microfiber, and well made. I have thin, below shoulder length hair, and my hair was mostly dry in one hour.  The best part is when you take your hair out of these wraps, there is a ""lift"" at the roots - you know....the reason you blow dry your hair with your head upside down. My hair was completely dry in a few minutes, with no frizz or static.  These wraps cut my hair routine time by half!  I machine washed both wraps according to basic micro fiber care (Wash in a washing machine with warm water and detergent. Avoid fabric softener.  Hang to dry or tumble dry with no heat.

4.0,Yes - this powder whitens....but,"This product actually does whiten teeth.  If it doesn't - you haven't been to a dentist in a while!

You can't expect anything ( even dentist whitening) to whiten your teeth over night. A dentist whitening has you come back several times - depending on how white you want.  It will take weeks, even months using this to get your teeth close to white, but if you use this every day - you will see a difference.  One more thing - instructions tell you to wet the tooth brush and dab it in the powder.  What they do not instruct is if the powder in the container gets wet - mold will begin to grow on it.  This happened with my first order.  Now, I put a small amount of powder on the outside top of the lid, dab with a wet brush, then throw the small amount left away.

2.0,I like it less with time and less and less,"I like foaming soaps to wash my face with and I bought it for that reason.

I have to say that it doesn't seem as strong as most hand soaps are, and I wouldn't have chosen it as hand soap if my hands got very dirty as I don't think it's strong enough.<br /><br />UPDATE: Having used this now for a couple of weeks, I like it less. The foam isn't the usual foaming soap, it's wetter and it drips - regular foam will hold together for a moment and let you apply it. And this also seems like very weak soap. I won't buy it again.<br /><br />2nd UPDATE: I can't believe how quickly the bottle is being depleted, given how little I use it and given that the foam doesn't seam all that 'soapy' and effective anyway.

5.0,The Sdara Hydrating Sheet Mask is definitely worth a try.  I will be buying it again.,"As of today, I have used these Sdara Hydrating Face Masks on two separate occasions.  The first thing I noticed was that it stayed in place on my face better than the mask from a different brand I had used previously.  The Sdara mask seems to be of a somewhat thinner material and it is well saturated with the hydrating ingredients.  Due to both these factors, it molds to the surface of the face more completely, as well as probably staying in place more easily.<br /><br />After sitting with the mask on for a while, I experienced a noticeable soothing sensation on my skin.  I found this to be pleasant and relaxing.<br /><br />The directions on the back of the packet containing the mask say to leave it on for 25-30 minutes.  From my two times experience with this product, I have to agree with that.  One time I left it on for more than 30 minutes and noticed a kind of astringent sensation on my skin.  The mask is not meant to be on for longer than 30 minutes.<br /><br />The directions written on the back of the packet are clear and easy to understand.  I was also thrilled to see that the mask is 100 percent biodegradable and cruelty free (no harsh laboratory testing on animals).<br /><br />Looking at the results afterward, my skin definitely looked less dry and felt softer.  I do plan on ordering a supply of these sheet masks again.  Thank you.",[],B07TFLVKF9,B07TFLVKF9,AHY4WWZPPCNTY3T4FDAA3ULEK22Q,1573678570411,5,True

Update: Mom is on Day 13 of her radiation to her jaw/face and is experiencing mucositis and redness to her face. We are still using Miaderm and she is experiencing very little inflammation to her skin (on the outside). FYI: I showed the radiation oncologist Miaderm and he looked at the ingredients list and said it has alcohol do not use it.I told him it was developed by radiation oncologist and Phase III clinical trials. And that it was not the type of drying alcohol. He would not even listen to me. He said only use aquaform (which is a petroleum based product-YUCK)otherwise ""you are going to come and say my skin is drying and blame me b/c I said it was okay to use"" He needs a refresher on chemistry - Yes the word ""alcohol"" is in the ingredients list but it is ceteryl alcohol different from the fermented alcohol that is drying. After leaving the clinic,  I pulled up the ingredient list for Aquaform and it had ""lanolin alcohol"" as an ingredient.. again it is a fatty conditioning ""alcohol"" not the drying kind-- urgh I wish I had known this to show him aquaform ingredient list!!

While I cannot confirm that the plastic itself is any different, it simply seems more stable and sturdy.  Because of the clip and other metal used, it seems like there is less stress placed on areas that could break or wear down over time from attaching/reattaching.<br /><br />Based on my experience with this size, I would be interested in a 1 and 1.5 guard from the professional series.

I purchased and had this delivered to 2 unrelated friends in different cities, who both were experiencing a mysterious, extreme, raw, red, crazy itchy, persistent, painful rash almost all over their bodies, that was causing much suffering, and would not go away.  And they had tried EVERYTHING, with no relief at all. I have known for some years about the healing powers of colloidal silver in all of its many forms.  So I sent them both a couple of jars of this cream to apply to their rashes. In fact, I sent them multiple options of topical and internal “natural”/non-pharma remedies to try.  (Because that is my thing, and they knew it.).  Both have reported back to me that it gave them literal IMMEDIATE, though not permanent, relief from the pain and itching when they apply this cream - so much so that they have re-ordered in larger quantities.  The rash is much improved, and far better than it was, but so far, after more than a month, not completely cured. They are still quite grateful to have this cream to provide relief when the rash flares up again.  And it seems to be the only thing that does help, after trying numerous remedies, including from the doctor. That is what I can tell you about this cream.",[],B007IAM4YU,B007IAM4YU,AEYL7R3BWZEAEIJ3KOQEQUQCND7Q,1656609903527,22,True

5.0,a happy mother with less hip pain.,"Bought this for my mom when she was complaining about severe hip pain from all the moving boxes she was carrying up her stairs...she is 63 and pretty tough, use to having to do things herself unfortunately. She went in for an adjustment but was still in pain. Rather than watch her take horrible pain meds, I ordered dmso. I'm a natural remedy kind of person, I loathe pharmaceuticals. I figured a cream was going to be most appealing for her since it could be easily measured and familiar to the average person who is used to allopathic cures.<br />She started using this dmso cream, putting it on in the evenings before bed, then again in the mornings. She noticed less and less pain, she said it reduced her pain from severe-keeping her from moving-to a slight ache. She doesn't always remember to apply 2x a day because the pain is so minor she forgets.<br />She really loves the cream, she has recommended it to her friends and coworkers and they have all ordered some too. I just love simple remedies!",[],B0070Z7KME,B00J7QCNDU,AETWW2WXKLM2WTNPMHGVYDUY26IQ,1431292885000,14,True

My only suggestion is to make super sure the lid is on tight after you fill up your brush bottle so it doesnt dry up.  I actually sealed the jar with electrical tape and that has worked great.

5.0,Great Product!,"I have tried many different products for my thin eyebrows.  This stamp kit works great! I save so much time.  I simply stamp and they are done.  Here is why I like these better than other stamp sets I've tried:<br /> 1. They have more stencils, and the one I use fits perfectly.  Other stencils packs have had fewer selection of eyebrow stencils and they are too big for my face.<br />2. They have two stencils of the same shape!  I have never had a stencil kit with this.  That way you use one for one eyebrow, and a different stencil for the other.  With other kits you have to use the same stencil and wipe it of makeup, otherwise you get unwanted makeup on your face.<br /> 2. Other stencils have this space across them that you have to fill in at the arch.  I am not sure why they are all have this.  These stencils do not have that space that I have to fill in, so I literally stamp and done.<br /><br />This is very easy to use.

The closest comparison I can make to this product is the Klairs 2 in 1 cotton pads. Klairs gives you two different kinds of cotton pads in a box, one of which is sponge-y and the other which is good for exfoliation.  I liked the Klairs pads, but I couldn't find an option that would let me purchase *just* the sponge-y ones. It was very annoying, because then I'd end up with a bunch of exfoliating pads I didn't want to use. These Silcot pads are the same as the Klairs sponge pads but even better! So happy I found these!

5.0,A Very Nice and Durable Nylon Cape..,"[[VIDEOID:a21fbc36a0c65b7469a2dff24bf2aa55]] This is a two product review&#34;<br />First Product Review is: ELFINA Salon Hair Cut Cutting NYLON Cape (Size 38&#34; x 54&#34;)<br />Second Product Review is: ELFINA Hair Cutting Shears/Scissors and Professional Barber Thinning and Texturizing Set.<br />Starting of with the Cape, This is a very nice and durable good size NYLON cape and you can tie it up or use the Velcro to secure it in place.<br />I also like that is very easy to clean just shake off any hair that is still on it and If you drop any hair product on it just grab a wet cloth a pass it thru is that simple.<br />Now I must say that I absolutely LOVE this Shears Set (Scissors & Texturizing) it also came in a really nice hard case for storage with a Comb, 2 hair clips plus a cloth to clean them after use. This set looks and feels like a great quality material and they are very easy to use and feel real comfortable on the hands while using them.<br />*** I did received both products Discounted/Free in exchange of my honest review and in no way I'm obligated to post a good review.

5.0,A nice and elegant brush that works great!,"[[VIDEOID:3e9c3dec1f15e9a69de3043202449644]] This brush is elegant and very efficient it has 5 different heating levels ranging starting at 250F for thin hair and going all the way up 450F for thick coarse hair. I straighten all my hair in less than 15 minutes and I was able to get my roots which is a plus for me, this brush left my hair nice and silky taking all the frizz out. I usually have to bump my other hair straighteners all the way to 450 but with this one I was able to straighten all my hair at 390F and that made me real happy! This brush came well packed in a really nice box and brings included two hair clips, one Heat  resistant glove, one little brush for cleaning, one beautiful storage bag for your brush and the Manual. This brush once you have the set temperature it locks automatically which is great that way you are not raising or lowering the temperature while using the brush and it also shuts off by it self after 30 minutes of non use. This is a really good quality brush that does not pull on the hair and straightens with just 1 or 2 strokes.<br />***I got this brush at a Discount/Free in exchange of my honest review and that is the reason why I'm including a video so that you can see for your self how amazing this brush works and I totally recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715UEyRFeyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715UEyRFeyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715UEyRFeyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2ts4oTKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2ts4oTKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z2ts4oTKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFtbzFh5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFtbzFh5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFtbzFh5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AgN4eNWVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AgN4eNWVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AgN4eNWVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C8404OC,B01C8404OC,AHVNNEQM5ATDHT6BPCYGIGNEL62A,1465426248000,14,False

1.0,More silicone than argan oil. Actual ingredients not clearly listed.,"I bought this because the seller listed the main ingredients as argan oil and resvesterol, when in fact the product is full of silicon and demethicone is listed before argan oil. I can see why there are rave reviews from other users.  This will give your hair a great TEMPORARY shine and silky soft feel but will end up robbing it of shine shortly and prevent your hair from absorbing moisture. You are not coating your hair with Arian oil but a rubber derivative. So th cuticle lays down short term but never gets the moisture that is causing the damage and frizz to begin with. I think someone who has science in their name would know that. Long term demethicone use will cause more drying and damage and is not good for your hair.<br /><br />I had actually wanted to use this product on my face, not hair because of the resvesterol. But it has an extremely strong scent of sandalwood that is overpowering and I would never be able to use it on my face.<br /><br />The bottle arrived in a box but leaked all over. I would have returned anyway because of the demethicone and smell. I bought pure cold pressed argan oil to use instead. It smells naturally like poo as all of them do but the smell dissipates in a few minutes.<br /><br />I do think the seller should make its ingredients clear to prospective buyers and not just list the deceptive &#34;main ingredients&#34; omitting the ingredients that are listed first when the package actually arrives and therefore are really the main ingredients.",[],B00KQW9ZKI,B00KQW9ZKI,AEVSAUHP7CVL25ACX7Z4SFIC2Z2A,1464370080000,3,True

The smell might be the case, it is just a vinyl/plastic case but the case is pretty and not stiff which is nice I like the double magnetic closure feature. Be aware there are no small brushes in this such as an eyeliner or brow brush, these are all decent size brushes though the bristles are a bit short on the larger brushes and I will use these more for blending. The handles are long enough that they feel good in my hand, I prefer a full handle for powders which these have. I will switch a few out of these for travel to have the smaller ones I use and have a perfect set and then there will be some nice additions to my home makeup brush collection for blending when I contour. There is also a brush description for each one so you know what they are theoretically to be used for and a card that says if you are not happy for any reason to contact the company.

5.0,Wow! Just get them!,"Who knew waxing with a small metal spatula would be so great?<br />Why does this matter?<br />I’m no stranger to self waxing. I’ve mostly used microwaveable waxes with wooden applicators. In case you were not aware, waxing is messy, even for a person who tries to be meticulous and keep things neat while involved with this task.<br />Let me take a moment to get this out before I go any further ... Bwahahahahaha<br />Ok.<br />I recently treated myself to a wax warmer because I wanted to wax larger areas and not have to run to the microwave frequently. Since the warmer pot is metal,the spatula can be scraped and kept reasonably clean during the waxing process. This also means that the wax on the spatula is not hardened and inhibiting the hot wax application (if you keep up with it).<br /><br />The Nitry Gritty...<br />- You are not wasting time! I cannot stress enough that time is something once spent, can’t be recovered. It’s precious!!<br />- You are not struggling to apply wax (as much as that’s possible)!<br />- This is small enough to allow quick, controlled applications in multiple areas while you wait for it to cool. Then rip away!<br />- Small enough to do parts of the face, but not under the eyebrows.<br />- Enough control to allow what you choose for size, direction, thickness and a little thicker pulling edge with minimal struggling. Tapered shape is very helpful. Not a flimsy product, very well made.<br />- Perfect to use with a wax warmer because the metal pot heats the metal spatula and makes cleaning it so much easier!<br /><br />If anyone is wondering, I used this with Kolua Wax (hard) sold here on Amazon. Click on my name to find my review of that product and others.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o7WnWjWyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o7WnWjWyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o7WnWjWyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xulP36+-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xulP36+-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xulP36+-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B075CSN5ZP,B08NHQ8RM2,AEDY4YOXY4BKY5VWJXD7RT2F7F2Q,1527044016571,9,True

5.0,Great for those suffering from seborrheic dermatitis or eczema,"I first purchased this soap at a Beauty Supply store near my house to use solely as a facial cleanser. I have a condition called Seborrheic Dermatitis, which causes raised, red, flaky rashes around my nose and mouth. It's similar to eczema and can be embarrassing, itchy, and uncomfortable. I treated it with medication prescribed by a dermatologist but after graduating from college, I suddenly found myself uninsured. I had heard about the effectiveness of both black soap and tea tree oil in treating various skin conditions like mine, so I was intrigued by a soap that provided both.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is how unprocessed it was compared to other black soap I've seen. This looks as if it's all natural. I've never used black soap before so I can't compare it to other products in anyway except appearance and price. Erzuli wasn't as pretty but it was more affordable.<br /><br />So the bottom line is...IT WORKS! It has completely tamed my seborrheic dermatitis as well or better than the steroidal medication I had been prescribed by my dermatologist, except without the cost and side effects.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />1) It feels odd. Perhaps, it's the tea tree oil but it feels as if there's some type of film over my face when I'm using it. It's not a bad feeling, just different than regular soap. At least in my head, it makes me feel as if my skin is actually getting moisturized.<br /><br />2) A little goes a very long way. This soap lasts forever....well at least if you only use it on your face like me. It lathers up like crazy. So don't waste it. I usually just rub it in my hands a couple times and than rub my hands together, which produces more than enough lather to wash my face. One bar has lasted months.<br /><br />3) It's messy. This is probably the biggest downside. The texture of this product is not like traditional soap. It becomes ""gummy"" after being exposed to water. I can literally take the bar of soap and bend it. It can actually get quite messy so I had to by a container to put the soap in which starts to look quite gross after a while.<br /><br />4) It tingles. I've heard black soap can tingle/burn a little, I definitely know tea tree oil can. So the two together means that if you leave it on your face for too long, it may start to burn a little. It's nothing too intense and for all I know, that might just mean it's working but I do try to let it sit on my face for only a minute or two before washing it off.<br /><br />5) The smell. There is not a strong tea tree oil smell, which for me is a plus. I wasn't sure what to expect but the scent is mild and inoffensive.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from a skin condition similar to mine. I just bought the pack of 2 here on Amazon, which was slightly more expensive than I had seen at the brick and mortar store but they were out of stock, and I couldn't bare the thought of running out. This is my new my secret weapon to having healthy looking skin. 5 stars!",[],B00IAA79JC,B00IAA79JC,AFIEU7P4FWBXHQBWJPZP6USHDHYA,1413035449000,8,True

5.0,I Like I-Fill,"This is my review of the Ifill K-Cup user fill system.  All in all, the system delivers a steady clean means of filling K-Cup bodies with coffee.  Below I will compare my experience with 4 different scenarios for drinking coffee from a K-Cup system<br /><br />1. A standard dark roast K-cup cartridge.  This was a non-Keurig brand that contained 10.76 grams of coffee.  The coffee was of reasonable flavor, very convenient to use, and with no mess to make, the capsule is too complicated to recycle. Most expensive system to use $0.50 to more than $1.00 per serving.<br />2. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen.  -  User filled screen capsule.  Somewhat messy to fill, brews reasonable tasting coffee, but will leave a little sediment of ground in your cup.  Holds 10.20 grams of coffee. The system is a pain to clean out.  Least expensive system as the screen cup may be reused many times over.<br />3. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen with added paper filter – User filled screen capsule with disposable paper filter that fits inside of the plastic screen capsule.  Takes a while to get the hang of fitting the filter into the capsule.  The system holds a little less coffee at 10.06 grams of coffee. The drinkable coffee produced has very little sediment in your cup.  This system is a little bit easier to clean up, but not much.  The filter cup removes fairly easily, but there is still a fair amount of rinsing of the plastic capsule to get rid of the coffee grounds that are on the top of the capsule lid.  Slightly more expensive due to having to purchase filters.<br />4. The IFill Cup -  The is a user fillable cup single use system.  The cup has a preinstalled filter that does well producing sediment free coffee.  The attached lid is made of foil that is supported by a plastic ring that is hinged to the IFill cup body.  Each lid has a very effective gummy seal that works well during the brewing process to keep coffee ground contained within the IFill Cup. After filling with grounds, the caps stay sealed to the cup body and seem to be shelf stable for more than a week.  So just fill a bunch in one session and you off to caffeine heaven for another week.  There is some potential mess when originally filling new cups, but the ability to simple toss the used cup without any mess is a great plus.  A lightly filled cup held 10.86 grams of coffee.  At this fill there seem to be very few leaks when the brew process is working.  A very densely packed and somewhat overfilled cup held 14.72 grams.  In this situation there was some leaking from the cup lid at the water insertion point, but this cup was fill to the point of abuse.  I believe this system is more expensive than using an Echo Cup but is much less hassle to use.  The system is less expensive than using factory filled K-cups.  So if you want to know what is in your KCup every morning, and don’t mind setting down and filling new capsules with coffee every once in a while – this is your system!<br /><br />Can you reuse an IFIll cup?  I guess you could, but I am not sure that hassle of cleaning out, drying, and hoping that the single use gum seal would work well would be worth the bother.<br /><br />Can you recycle the product?  The company says yes, in reality I would guess that being most other KCup devices are not recyclable when the cup finally gets to the recycle guy for sorting, they are going to “Think KCup” and sort it directly into the trash.<br /><br />All in all, the IFill seems to be a great user fill KCup system.  Nice flavor from your own beans, easy setup, use and disposal of the product.  – I will be reordering more soon!",[],B00XNQX7US,B00XNQX7US,AE6QUS7S2CMWBBXNYR3K64A5BNHQ,1448110925000,4,True

If you have a slippery tile or enamel floor to your bathtub or shower you will be good to go. But who wants to have a slippery shower floor?<br /><br />The second flaw is the curved piece that sits over the base.  If it had been designed properly, that piece would have been made from a bendable silicone so that if your foot hit it you wouldn't end up cursing a blue streak. But I am sure that was a money decision....easier to mold a one piece product than to have to assemble 2 pieces.<br /><br />As for the pumace breaking, I don't feel the product is meant to stand on with your full weight.

5.0,Game changer!!!!,"This little gadget made me love my favorite and very expensive dryer even more! I love my hair dryer (L'ange Styliste Luxe) sooooooo much but the diffuser it came with is no match for my long curly hair! The dryer is too powerful for it and ends up just tangling my hair into a frizzy mess.  However, thanks to the Snozzlepro I am able to combine my favorite diffuser  (xtava black orchid) with my favorite dryer and I now have the perfect tools to keep my curls smooth and defined and beautiful! Only cons for me are that it's a little difficult to get on the diffuser but once it's on its all good and the price is a little high for my liking. However, It's worth it since it works well! Also it got here wayyyyy faster than the estimated delivery date. So really I'm extremely satisfied so far.

4.0,Unique Mask for All Ages,"This MagiForet Star Mask is meant to help firm, lift, and tone your face. As I age I don’t mind the wrinkles or even the age spots. What I do mind is my sagging skin. Yes, having jowls terrifies me. This Star Mask was more comfortable than I thought it would be. You put a layer on and let it set between 20-30 minutes until it is completely dry. Usually, I can only stand to wear a mask 10 minutes, but this mask was so comfortable that I dozed off with it on. I woke up just in time to remove.<br /><br />Removal was a little difficult and made me wonder how tugging on my skin actually helped with firming, toning, and lifting. I’ve only had a chance to try this mask once so I cannot say that it’s going to keep the jowls at bay. What positive results I did have was my face was so soft and bright after removing this mask. Best of all my overly sensitive skin wasn’t irritated in the least. It is a mask that I am going to incorporate into my skincare routine and hopefully, the jowls never appear.  You need such a small amount of this mask that the 1.7 fl oz jar should last you through many maskings.  Also, the jar is so pretty it can sit on your vanity and no one will be the wiser that you have a black glittery gel inside.<br /><br />The only thing I didn’t like was the glitter was uncomfortable during application. Some of the larger sized glitters would catch and scratch your skin until they laid down. Not to the point of marks or blood. Just an annoyance.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a reduced price for testing purposes. .","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ExUwu8N7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ExUwu8N7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ExUwu8N7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07FCPL1XW,B07FCPL1XW,AGAH5NPM6T7JR6Z65ON6W6YS2AJQ,1540215642631,0,False

5.0,Satisfied and Recommend,"I purchased my starter kit directly from Revel, plus an extra color. Since I rely on reviews from Amazon, I'm including mine to help others.<br />My colors are the first photo-Shady and Starburst.<br />My first attempt was with Shady and I did a great job on my left hand, but didn't smooth out the right enough. It held up well, but I only got a week out of it because I couldn't deal with the bad job I'd done on my right hand.<br />The second photo is the second time I did my nails and first time I used Starburst. Glitter is more forgiving.  I realized that with two coats of the color, you could still see the white of my nail through it. The second time I used this color, I used a white base (Fresh Cotton from Sally's). This second time is the grid photo with the purple/silver.<br /><br />From start to finish (with bare nails) this takes about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Advice:<br />1-Watch YouTube tutorials. All systems have different instructions, so they might not all apply to your kit. Keep that in mind as you watch them.<br />2-Let the dip dry before you brush off the excess. I didn't do that before, but employed that advice my third time (purple/silver photo) and it was a better experience.<br />3-Don't do this without a good buffer. A plain old nail file ain't gonna cut it!<br />4-I bought nail clips to hold the acetone-soaked cotton on my nails and it works way better than foil. I can do all my nails at once.<br />5-Before stating dip polish, after washing hands, wipe nails with alcohol pad. It gets all the oils off your nails. This is good advice for regular polish, too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716z9vOc2uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716z9vOc2uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716z9vOc2uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CEP9zRLVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CEP9zRLVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CEP9zRLVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RWUCfn7lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RWUCfn7lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RWUCfn7lL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mJfTIgrdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mJfTIgrdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mJfTIgrdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C7532DM,B01C7532DM,AG2U5AWXO2TD7DLSLJHNJURRPXKA,1551525852116,3,False

5.0,"Low cost, quality OEM replacement","SUMMARY:<br />I found these blades to be a much lower cost, good-excellent quality alternative to stock Gillette blades.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE?  Note, however, I always perform proper cleaning maintenance after each shave.  To wit: I brush off the blades using the tooth brush bristles to get in between the blades, then blow on it a few times to clear off most of any remaining water droplets.  This greatly retards oxidation and corrosion of the blade edges.  For anyone groaning right now, that &#34;whole big process&#34; takes all of 10 seconds!  That's fast by any measure.<br /><br />LIFE:<br />Using the above standard methodology of use, I got just as long a use per blade as stock Gillette's ... roughly 2 months per blade ..  before there is a any hint of snagging, rather than cutting, my hairs.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />I found the slightly larger size of the blade head felt a bit odd but only on the very 1st shave.  It soon felt good, even reassuring, as it provided a broader surface to go over my skin.<br /><br />CUTS?<br />One reviewer said they cut him easily.  I, too, have been cut, but it was by the stock Gillette blades. Frankly, it's going to happen with any blade ... eventually.  Some units of any make blades will be slightly off on rare occasion or have inconsistent edges than can cut or scratch.  Then, there's the matter of user technique.<br /><br />After 4-5 decades on this earth, a shaver should get a sense of their skin hairs, how they slant, how sensitive the skin is underneath, and, most importantly, how tough their skin has become.  These things are even more critical for women who are forced to shave areas infinitely more sensitive than those of men. Mature adults usually have tougher skin from loss of collagen, sun degradation, and for simply having shaved many 1,000's of times.  Younger shavers tend to have sensitive skin and are less attuned to the proper angles at which to pull the shaver to deal with their skin profile.<br /><br />I took the above side trip to highlight that for some, the minutest difference in blades could cause some shavers to cut themselves - not necessarily due to blade defects or construction style but, perhaps, simply because they have not spent as much time adapting their technique to a new blade as they did to their previous one.  That is, days or weeks versus many years!  Remember how many times new shavers cut themselves when 1st shaving?  The same experiential curve applies to those changing blade models - not matter their age or shaving experience level.<br /><br />VALUE:<br />So far, for me, these low cost blades are a tremendous value. Plus I bought a 5 pack for $0.97 on a 1-time CVS sale. Then bought another at the regular (way cheaper than OEM) price of $16 for 10.  So, I'm good for another 1.25 years at 2 months per blade.<br /><br />COST PER SHAVE:<br />Excluding the clearance price I got on a 5-pack, the $16 price for 10 = $1.60 each.  With a mean time to replacement of 2 months (for me), that equates to $1.60 / 60 days = $0.0267 cents per shave or roughly $0.81 / month or $9.74 / year.<br /><br />BLADE AGING PROFILE:<br />The &#34;newness&#34; feeling and sharpness wore off at about the same rate as do my Gillette blades.<br />To wit: 1-5 shaves = feels like new using 2-3 strokes/pass<br />  5-20 = 3-4 strokes/pass<br />20-40 = 4-5 strokes/pass<br />40-60 = 5-6 strokes/pass<br />Only then do I toss and replace unless, of course, I come upon a blade that seems to have aged quicker for whatever reason.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />They look, feel, and age not much differently than Gillette blades and cost 50-75% less.  Look for CVS in-store at your local branch then check Amazon to ensure you find the lowest cost.",[],B078VZMJKN,B078VZMJKN,AGMU3GG4QZRUH7I2QQUTE4JQNCYQ,1524437192226,5,True

4.0,Exceptional fragrance for consumers who like airy florals!,"The Bouquet Garni Fragranced Body Shower gel’s most prominent characteristic is its scent.  It definitely has the airy, ethereal fragrance of a delicate powder, leaving a pleasant and gentle scent wafting after washing—no additional cologne or perfume needed Though it takes between (an estimated) 1-2 tablespoons of the gel to get sufficient lathering action, once it does, it cleans well and does result in that wonderful fragrance post showering.  One claim from the promo text I do somewhat question is that of “perfectly moisturized skin.” I would have to say that any moisturizing properties are just average, not exceptional. Part of the evaluation criteria is assessing thickness and packaging. Thickness is exactly what I would expect it to be, remaining where it’s poured lying atop a washcloth and neither running off nor penetrating the cloth until appropriate action is taken. As for the packaging, the design appeal of colors and shape get high marks. Unfortunately, my bottle is one where the pump would never fully unlock, dispensing only a minute amount at a time, which is both impractical and extremely frustrating. I’ve had to remove the pump and pour, which is much less efficient. Generally, this product would be toward the outside price range of what I would consider, but I do think its exceptional fragrance makes it worthwhile purchase both for a gift or for personal use knowing it will result in a clean, soft fragrance requiring no additional products.",[],B0872WCSKP,B08YJV9YL2,AHOWVWMPAOG4GHBA442RB2ZQGJLA,1605705813220,2,False

But that hope was unfulfilled and for olfactory purposes, you should consider this strictly Teatree oil. Consequently, though I tried it, I didn’t feel as though it provided any specific benefit, other than smelling like Teatree oil if you consider that a benefit. As a side note, either my bottle was not properly sealed or there was a problem with packaging, but approximately a quarter of my Hemp Infused Teatree Oil had leaked out during shopping and made for messy handling.",[],B08234RH6Z,B08234RH6Z,AHOWVWMPAOG4GHBA442RB2ZQGJLA,1578946874429,0,False

4.0,"Pretty, long-lasting, subtle color","I tend to not wear a lot of eyeshadow, so when I do, I gravitate towards very neutral, but slightly shimmery colors. I was therefore really excited to try this product.<br /><br />The product comes in this adorable little plastic container with a fun image of a cat on it. There is a small mirror on the inside of the lid. I appreciate that the container latches securely, so bits of loose powder don't get all over the place in my makeup bag. I would, however, appreciate if they found a way to fit a tiny applicator somewhere in the underside of the container. I had to dig one out from my makeup drawer.<br /><br />This is an eyeshadow duo with a slightly pinker, and a more taupe-y shade. As you can see from the pic, these colors are very, very subtle on paler skin like mine. However, there is a nice shimmer to them that makes it stand out a bit.  I like that the eyeshadow is pretty clingy and didn't get all over my face when I was applying it. It is long-lasting--at the end of the work day, it still is quite noticeable when I look in the mirror.<br /><br />Currently, the eyeshadow is retailing at about $22. I think this is a bit high, hence the 4 star review, but for makeup fanatics this probably is a good investment. Overall, I'd recommend this product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618wNAxGPPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618wNAxGPPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618wNAxGPPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SrJGxgVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SrJGxgVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SrJGxgVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KqjZnvXCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KqjZnvXCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KqjZnvXCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QwKPAcpmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QwKPAcpmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QwKPAcpmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Q3YHJ1Z,B07Q3YHJ1Z,AFGONYOG3EHIYECLADEGJK4SP26A,1569093879786,0,False

5.0,Perfect gift for skin-care lovers!,"Perfect gift for your skin-care loving friend!<br />I have loved this skin care set. I have been using all 3 products almost every day for the past 3 weeks. The gift/value set comes with a instant-foaming face wash, serum, and face moisturizer. This is my first time trying this brand, and I am very impressed.<br /><br />The instant-foaming face wash:<br />I have never tried an instant-foaming wash before. It still produced a nice lather on my face. It is great for a daily moisturizer, but I still like to use an exfoliant every few days.<br /><br />The serum:<br />The serum had a more creamy texture. It soaked into my skin quick. It created a nice based for the moisturizer.<br /><br />The moisturizer:<br />The moisturizer was thick and creamy. I have VERY dry skin, and my skin soaked it right up. It felt really nice on my skin. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day after using in the morning.<br /><br />None of the products irritated my skin. I have dry skin with some rosacea.

5.0,Quick morning mask!,"Did you skip your skin case routine before bed? Did you then proceed to wake up too late to do it in the morning? Look no further for your solution!<br />I really enjoy these quick morning masks. Sometimes my face needs refreshing before I put my makeup on in the morning, but I rarely wake up early enough to wait for a 15-20 min mask to set in. This mask is perfect, because you only need 5 minutes. I put mine on and I make my coffee and feed my cats. By the time I’m done with that, it’s about time to take off the mask and start getting ready.<br />The mask moisturized and refreshed my skin. My face felt ready to put my makeup on. It didn’t make my face too oily for my makeup or anything. My makeup set in nicely.<br />The packaging is nice. It is similar to a tissue box. There are little tweezers to help you grab out a mask.<br />I have tried some other types of masks from this brand, and this is my favorite I have tried from Lapcos. I would use this product again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbn8WnQsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbn8WnQsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbn8WnQsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3YDKMJ,B07V3YDKMJ,AEFMCBLYNEBUKFSKBXOBRV7QFRLA,1596169864640,1,False
5.0,Nice sturdy elastics in fun colors,"I use little hair bands like these every day for my husband’s hair. He has very long hair, and he works manual labor. Every morning, I slick his hair back in a braid. It is important I use nice hair elastics, so the braid stays on all day. I have tried ones from a local dollar store that weren’t very sturdy; they kept breaking off during the day.<br />I decided to give these a try. I am impressed by the quality. The elastics are sturdy. The elastic stayed put in his hair for 24 hours through work and sleep.<br />This product comes with a lot of hair bands!

4.0,Nice bronzer and packaging,"The best part of this bronzer duo is the packaging. The container holding the bronzer and highlighter is very heavy. It is either made of ceramic or metal. It took me a minute to figure out how to open the compartment. The top part slides to the right to show the bronzer/highlight duo.<br /><br />The bronzer does a good job. It goes on my skin very smoothly. It is a naturally bronze color. This shade is for light shaded skin tones. I don’t think the bronzer is dark enough for medium/dark skin tones.<br /><br />The highlight isn’t shimmery enough for me. In the picture I posted with this review, I used the bronzer from this product and a different highlight.<br /><br />The bronzer and packaging were a hit for me, but the highlighter was a miss.

This is great for removing the old nails (and any leftover glue) before applying my new set and then I can use the other attachments to remove any excess glue after applying my new set.

I started using my regular curling iron as a wand but the hair would get stuck in the handle and there wasn't as much length since you have the plastic tip of the curling iron as well as the handle. Finally decided to buy a real wand. This one works AMAZINGLY well! It took me less than 10 minutes to do ALL of my hair (and that's not an easy task)! The glove is too big so it's pretty useless, but I would like to find a glove since I still occasionally burn a finger here and there.

I've never found a powder that sets so well but still looks natural. I cannot imagine ever using another powder. I like to put a little in a lid from an old powder and use my Beauty Blender (still slightly damp from applying my foundation) and just lightly press into the skin and VIOLA! Beautiful, flawless skin that lasts all day.

It has three clips: one at the apex and two at the hairline, which help the piece stay in very well.<br /><br /> I do have two major complaints:<br /><br />1. The shape of the weft is oddly irregular, thick and stiff, which means I have to play around with the placement and styling quite a bit.<br /><br />2.

5.0,Whitens My Skin!!,"I'm Korean, 26, and I take care of my skin religiously. I bought these on a whim, since Amazon was offering them at $20 for 10 masks, which usually cost $35 in Korea. IOPE is somewhat of a luxury brand so I decided to try it. I've been scratching my head trying to figure out what the ingredient is, but something in these masks are whitening my skin! :D The mask itself is gauze-like and has tiny speckles in it, but it's not an impurity or defect, it's embedded in the fabric itself. The aluminum packaging is crinkly, but IOPE explains that it's due to their sterilization process (they sterilize the masks in the packaging).<br /><br />I've tried many many Korean masks, but I've never had one whiten my skin the way this one does. It whitens by making my pores disappear. At first I thought some kind of white substance must be filling in my pores, but the essence is clear and even if I rub the product off my skin, the pores are still gone (not visible). Either my pores are getting super cleaned or super tightened. I'm excited either way by these masks. I don't have acne or sensitive skin, but I do have large pores from harsh acne treatments 10 years ago. These masks make my skin look like snow without those ugly blackheads showing. I can't stop staring at the mirror when I take the mask off, it's the one time I can admire an evenly-toned whitened skin.<br /><br />There's a ton of essence in each mask by the way (I mean a TON) so I like to pour it in a spray bottle and save it for mist for makeup application.

5.0,I love containers and was looking for something to hold about ...,"I love containers and was looking for something to hold about half a cup of nuts, candy, etc. for taking in my lunches. I try to organize stuff on the weekends so I can just grab and go every morning while packing my lunch for work.<br />These containers are going to be great for my purpose, I can tell already! They hold a tad more than half a cup (I poured 1/2 cup water in one to test it and there was still a small amount of room above the water line). The included liner is fantastic. I only tested one container so far, but it was the one I put 1/2 cup of water in. I put the liner on the container, screwed the top on and turned it upside down, sideways, and shook it. No leakage! Very impressive. I probably won't use liquid in these containers but it's nice to know they don't leak if I find a liquid I want to put in them. I might just take yogurt in them!<br /><br />I've included pictures so you can see the size, how well they are made and how they came packaged. There was bubble wrap around the package of containers, then they were in plastic under the bubble wrap also. I had to get my scissors out to get into the bubble wrap, it was on securely.<br />The containers themselves seem to be a medium thick plastic, definitely not flimsy. There is nothing on them to indicate the type of plastic they are made of, but Houseables says they are made of polypropylene and safe for spices, cooking oils, etc. The Livestrong website states &#34;Polypropylene containers do not leach harmful chemicals into foods or liquids. They commonly contain yogurt, medicine, drinks, ketchup and medicines.&#34;<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the included liners, as I imagined they would be the same type of liners you get in the top of some medicine bottles - a thin piece of waterproof paper that won't last long. The liners in these containers are great! I've included a picture of them as well.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but I feel they are totally worth the full price of $11.99. I was planning on buying them anyway and was pleased to get a discount. If I didn't like them, I would tell you that too. A review is no good if it's not honest. If they break easily or something else happens that causes my opinion of them to change, I'll update my review to reflect that.<br /><br />One of the photos has a green [[ASIN:B00FP2RMUY Gotubb 3-Pack, Multi, Medium]] on top of these, so if you are familiar with Gotubbs you can judge the size of the Houseables jars a bit better. I love my Gotubbs and how they open with one hand, but they do cost a lot more than these Houseables jars. If you are looking for a lot of storage for a low price, this is the product to get!<br /><br />**Update** I'm still using these containers and they are still as great as ever! I am watching my weight and these help me keep track of my food intake and make it easy to grab and go with a premeasured amount of food. They hold a single serving size of wheat thins perfectly, are handy for a scoop of slim fast powder and two teaspoons of Benefiber mixed together (I use the included liners for this application), hold a serving of Hershey Kisses and come in handy for a lot more! I love to prepackage this stuff then grab and go in the mornings.

It's definitely a different color than the other but there's no orange and it looks great, probably even better than the Grey one. Whew!<br /><br />(Original post)  I've tried quite a few but this is my favorite eyebrow pencil so far. It does wipe off easily, but if you keep your hands off it doesn't disappear, change color or fade like others. I love the grey (which is actually a taupe on my skin. I have naturally black brows which are thinning and even some hairs are now grey and I really hate it. When I use this pencil they look more natural than the others. (My hair is silvery white grey, was black when younger.) I don't feel the color looks so harsh as flat grey or black pencils and doesn't turn orange like some browns I've tried.  I use the small end to outline and the other to fill in. I hoped to use the small to draw individual brow hairs but the pencil is quite soft and does not really work like that.

I blink a few times, and the ends start to lift, a few more times, and they fall right off.<br /><br />They're super lightweight, and they're not incredibly thick, which makes them look more natural than some lashes I've used, but they just will not stay on.<br /><br />I'm using Kiss lash glue, so the glue isn't the problem. It holds just fine on lashes with at least some kind of band.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xyd4RU4OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xyd4RU4OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xyd4RU4OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07LFV749P,B07LFV749P,AF6FWH3EDVZXL2RY7IPX7G42EDYA,1594838707486,0,True

5.0,"Super shave quality, deceptively quiet, and goes forever on a charge.","I can't think when I last rated any product with all five stars but this one gets them!<br /><br />I have always used ""foil"" shavers over the past 30 or so years and they have varied widely in the quality of shave. Only one would I have rated at the top for shave quality that approached blade shaving and that one was purchased about 24 years ago. I never gave multi-head rotary shavers much thought...until this one. This shaver beats EVERY electric shaver I haver ever owned or tried for shave quality...even ""dry"" (without using any kind of pre-shave). With a pre-shave lotion it is even better. This is a great on-the-road shaver to keep in your car for those super-quick erasures of 6-o'clock shadows.<br /><br />This thing is super quiet. It doesn't ""buzz"" but the sound it does make is a very quiet one that makes you think it is running at a slow speed...yet it races right through a 3-day growth as fast as you can ""mow"" your face. The rotor housing pops right off and you just shake the stubs out if you have been using dry or only with pre-shave. If you use it in the shower...well, rinse it off in there!<br /><br />Battery life so far has been unexpectedly good. It has a countdown charge timer built into the on-off switch that starts at 60 (supposed minutes) but after a good estimated half hour of shaving mine only ticked down to about 43 before I plugged it in to my laptop to charge. It only comes with a USB charging corder (it's proprietary at one end so don't lose it!) that can plug into any power-providing standard USB port. Many hotels now have USB charging ports on their bathroom outlets and you even find them on things like inexpensive power strips. Of course, you can purchase a standalone USB charger...but I see no need in my case give this thing seems to just ""sip"" power and would likely last a multi-week business trip without the need to charge.<br /><br />Its flip out trimmer is rather smallish but gets the job done and trims very closely. Works as well as any I have tried/owned.<br /><br />I don't see a real downside to this shaver. I don't know (haven't checked) where you might find additional rotary blades if you need them but the shaver is so inexpensive you could buy five or six whole shavers for the price of other ""mid range"" rotaries I have tried that don't give as good a shave.<br /><br />Unless you are a real brand-loyalist or your current shaver gives what you consider a ""perfect"" this is THE ONE TO GET.",[],B07K1DRCYR,B07K1DRCYR,AEG25N6DVTQ6LCP2BPOWVV3OE7HA,1571369591268,0,True

They are quite strong with plastic ‘teeth’ and a metal clamp that secures the teeth.  They look like they’ll last and last.<br /><br />One hundred clips are packed in a plastic, re-sealable bag.  The cost is very modest, especially considering how useful they can be.  I’m pleased to recommend them.<br /><br />FIVE STARS!<br /><br />Sample provided for impartial review.",[],B01AG8P0KK,B01AG8P0KK,AGMVZOQA2BL3IFNIKW76523RM6ZQ,1456623596000,2,False

3.0,Think what you would use this for before buying.,"I’m not really impressed, I was debating with this and I should have went with my first thought. When I opened it I though I got a lunch box on accident lol . The separators are flimsy and do not “separate” what’s so ever. Your things will slip under them. I can see it working better without them. They Velcro to the sides but it’s hard to get them Straight. What I do like is the top portion with the pockets they are big and nice.The bag itself is a nice size and I could see myself loving this if it would just come already sectioned instead of the removable ones. Overall the quality of the bag is good and even though I can’t use it for what I initially wanted to I found use for it. So 3 stars from me.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yC7mVPskL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yC7mVPskL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yC7mVPskL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gTdg70ZgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gTdg70ZgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gTdg70ZgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oTRNyqymL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oTRNyqymL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oTRNyqymL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RGQQF1Y,B07RGQQF1Y,AE4LAKL7HPJO5DM537PP4MDZ2R2Q,1573384028103,0,True
