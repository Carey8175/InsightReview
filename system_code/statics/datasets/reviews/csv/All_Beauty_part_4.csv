4.0,Good for Calming Frizzy Hair,This argan oil and shea butter serum works pretty well. I use it on really dry days. When it is dry and cold my hair is crazy. It sticks out every which way and is impossible to make it lay flat or be reasonable. This stuff helps calm it down. It makes it actually lay down and gives it a smooth look. It does take some practice at applying it. If I get distracted it is easy to put too much and make my hair look oily. I have used product like this in the past that come in spray bottles or pump bottles and that made it easier to get just what I needed. This bottle has an eye dropper type applicator. I am not a fan of this. I use it to drop some into the palm of my hand and then rub it between my hands and carefully apply it to my hair starting in the back on the most underneath layer that way the front and the top layer do not get too oily. After applying it I gently brush my hair to work it through completely. I regularly put way too much in my hands and wash it off so I don't over do it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yVPRpVteL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yVPRpVteL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yVPRpVteL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wJPV1CxZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wJPV1CxZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wJPV1CxZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B019O277A0,B019O277A0,AEBWCJUFU3OGEZ3ON6MAETLWT45A,1454218989000,1,False

I can smell a tiny bit of odor, but it's gone as soon as the product evaporates.  I am someone that cannot abide hand cleansers with any kind of fragrance.  For me, the CleanSmart is perfect in that regard.  Only reason I gave 4 vs. 5 stars is that it's thin, watery consistency makes it difficult to use.  I need to use 4-5 spritzes to get my hands/fingers thoroughly coated and rub my hands together.  But with that much cleanser it's dripping all over the place.  Otherwise, I like it a lot.

You can just design the pouf with a hole in the middle, so it fits over the little knob on the interior lid. Problem solved. Until there's an update, I might just try to diy.

1.0,"Painful, needs eye protection, hard to read and unclear manual","I am interested in red light therapy. We all want to look younger, right? But, I feel like this was a bad idea.<br /><br />It comes in a box labeled ""Colorful LED Beauty Mask"" rather than the one pictured in the main listing photo. There doesn't seem to be a company name on anything. The product looks the same and the box I received is shown in other photos, so I believe I got the right thing.<br /><br />As the manual says, ""Normal people use or stop using, ask the doctor after doctor."" Yes, the manual is that poorly translated. I'm O.K. with a little grammar error here and there, but this was hard to understand. It doesn't make one feel confident in the quality. I don't even think it mentioned the microcurrent pegs. Do you need to use them or are they optional? What do they do? I really don't know after reading the manual.<br /><br />I can tell you that without the pegs in, the eye part dug in and felt horrible. I adjusted the mask strap to very loose, so it wasn't that. With the pegs in, the pegs in my forehead dug in and left marks that lasted over 30 minutes later, and one spot was still sore the next day. The microcurrent on just the lowest setting was a bit uncomfortable. Maybe it would be better when wearing a face mask, which is encouraged and which I had wanted to try.<br /><br />The eye holes do not block all the light from my eyes. The manual says to close eyes or use pads or eye shades. Dermatologists actually say to use blackout or opaque goggles.<br /><br />I didn't find it that heavy. Just awkward and painful. As others have mentioned, this is better lying down, since you can't open your eyes anyways. But, it's still not comfortable. It's also strange that the cord is only 3 1/2 feet, or maybe almost 4 feet stretched out. If I was to use it in bed, I'd need an extension cord.<br /><br />I can suffer a little for beauty, but I'm worried about the safety of this given the poor instructions, poor design and unknown origins. I can't recommend this for anyone, but in particular it is prohibited for pregnant women, children, thyroid disease, light allergic, drug users, and those with skin trauma (see photo).

I’m hoping Detroit will come out with a VEGAN beard butter version as most other beard butters are.<br /><br />I had been looking at purchasing a beard butter  for a while from Detroit because I liked the fragrances I read that were used. I had no real idea what they’d smell as most folks who use beard products may understand. Also, fragrances can often be way too strong and these all mostly seemed just right. It stinks when you spend a bunch of money that is going to be on your face all day/night and turns out it is awful smelling, triggers migraines, etc. … this sample pack helps mitigate waste to find your favorite scents and the price seems reasonable.<br /><br />With all that said, most of the fragrances smell mature and very nice.

At the first use, it may feel hard. It is recommended that you soak<br />the brush in warm water for a while, and use it after it gets soft. The soaking time can vary, yet it generally lasts shorter than a minute.<br />Due to the artificial-planting method, when using a new brush, a few loose bristles will fall down, which is normal. If used properly, the really root-<br />planted bristles will not fall.<br />When using, do not soak it in water for long.

There in fact a lot of color left on my face and this product removed it.  I like to use this to remove my makeup before I wash with my sonic face cleaner.  I do feel the micllar cleansing water really does need to be rinsed off after use.  For waterproof eye makeup, I find just let the pad sit about 30 seconds and then wipe away.

No tangles in the hair, no rips in the cap and no loose weft.<br />My only recommendation is that you do a little diy and sew in some wig clips, (not wig combs). Two clips are good, but three clips are better. (Front and both sides).<br />The cap can easily slide off your head...a strong swish of wind, a snag or an adjustment of the lid is cause for a devastating, but quite hilarious reveal! Even on the tightest setting for my head, the cap EASILY slid off.<br />Without the wig clips, I wouldn't chance wearing this anywhere other than sitting at your desk on a video chat. No sudden moves thought. Lol<br />I will definitely be purchasing this cap unit again. I love the look and convenience of popping it on and going! I don't mind the DIY wig clips. It's worth the trouble, although I think the manufacturer should already have this installed in their caps.<br />Wear with caution, but you'll look cute and stylish for sure!!",[],B08GZV2C44,B08GZV2C44,AGGPMJZOXULE6FWRHDOSHLMY2FNA,1623423693371,2,True

I decided that I wanted something with a motor that would really get the job done.  Most of the products I found had mediocre to bad reviews until I found this one.  I decided to give it a try.  Now that I have it I don't think I'll even use a foot file again!  It is very easy to use and works to file the skin away with ease.  I love the adjustable speed.  I keep it about a third of the way up.  The first time I used it (with the course disc) I had the speed set higher and my skin became very warm and felt like it was burning to I turned it down to a slower speed.  The fine disc I can use at a higher speed.  I can file my feel in a few minutes and they look and feel great.  I have used it 4 times so far and both of the discs seem like new, so I suspect that I won't need to buy refills for a while.

Over time, I'm sure it will get dirty. A removable cover would have been great. I will probably cut off an old sock and place it over it to keep it clean as I do not want a soiled cover on my eyes. Second, when heated the recommended 20 seconds, the heat only lasts about 10 minutes before it's no longer warm enough. To heat any longer than 19-20 seconds would be too long.

It really made her shine on Halloween (and now every day haha).  It seems to be very good quality... a crown for her to wear for many dress-up years to come!

If you don't style your hair, that's not a problem, but I spend at least a little time blow drying my hair and this tends to mess with my handiwork.  Also, it's not clear whether this is just meant to be a texturizing spray or texture/hold spray.  It seems to have a light hold--which is nice--just not enough for my super-fine hair.

5.0,Seriously Good,"I know this is going to sound like, ""yeah, right...""  but seriously.  The mineral wash has potassium in it, which is very good for skin health.  I have a couple of warts, and when I showered with this I applied a drizzle of the wash directly to the warts and let it set there for a minute or two before rinsing it off.  Over the course of a month or so, the warts got smaller and they no longer got caught on clothing, etc.  Recently my grocery store stopped selling the mineral wash and I thought St. Ives had stopped making it.  So I tried other washes, but I could find none that have potassium in them. I have gone without my St.Ives Mineral Wash for about two months.  One of the warts is coming back again. But today I discovered that I can still buy it, and I'm so relieved! It is a great body wash.  Besides the ""wart benefit"" (which I'm sure St.Ives would not endorse)...it has a nice clean fragrance and keeps my skin looking and feeling healthy without any heavy perfume smell. If that's all it did, I'd still use it!  Don't ever stop making the Mineral Body Wash, St.Ives!",[],B004JLCQIU,B004JLCQIU,AFUIWVUVWMJSTX4IL24VXA4D6KVA,1329605272000,1,False

The cost is a bit more than standard harsh unnatural chemical soaps but it is worth it, as a bar will last more than a month (one 20 minute shower a day).

5.0,No More Frizz,"I got this product and I had 3 day old hair. I applied a few sprays straight away to see how my hair would respond. My hair is naturally wavy and is prone to frizz. My hair is untreated, I never use heat tools and I try to stick to more natural products. My hair is wavy for 1-2 days after washing and then it starts to look frizzy. I live in a warm climate so I think the sun has impact on my hair. I wanted some protection from that. So back to this first try, my 3 day old hair was frizzy and after a few sprays it reduced that by 60-70%. The scent is light and my hair never felt heavy or looked oily. So after washing my hair I applied the product to damp hair. My hair looked very nice and never looked oily or felt heavy. It helped keep my wavy hair from getting frizzy all the way to my next wash day. This product is not as ""green"" as I would like but it is a good product that works well. I am not sure if it actually provides sun protection. I am happy with my purchase and will continue using it at least 1-2 times a week.",[],B07HLML823,B07HLML823,AFESNLBM6RYOIFB6MBM7VN6277KA,1607318803236,10,True

5.0,Good dupe for bright pink,"For some reason, the same brand's version of bright pink has been expensive lately, so I tried the plum + bubblegum pink.

I needed very little plum to create the color.<br /><br />The picture is first week after dying, color only on top of non-treated, non-bleached hair. The difference between back and front is a function of color depositing on grey, an effect I like because it gives some variation and highlighting effects.

Very little oil production.<br />—I’m new to Vitamin C serums. I began using this product daily. It dried out/irritated my skin. I cut back to 2-3x/week (after a skin a little break). The dryness and irritation went away.<br />—For those accustomed to Vitamin C serums- this might not be an issue.<br />—I also followed the recommendations to refrigerate after opening to prolong longevity (Vitamin C is very unstable in liquid form)<br />—I’m into Naturopathy and clean skin scare products. There were no questionable ingredients on the box label (via EWG SkinDeep website).<br />—I’ve researched different forms of Vitamin C: serums and powders with and without feurlic acid to understand what to look for in a Vitamin C serum.<br />Pro’s<br />EWG SkinDeep database check came back Good. (ingredient list label is difficult to read. One ingredient wasn’t recognized in EWG)<br />Dark glass bottle with screw on lid. Comes with dropper that also screws onto bottle.<br />Clear and semi-watery serum (Vitamin C serum should be clear, not yellow, brown or cloudy). No oiliness....very liquidity.<br />Ample size- 1.01 fluid ounces<br />Easy to apply- 2-3 drops is sufficient<br />Sinks into skin quickly<br />Improvement of rough patches (face feels smoother)- thinking of trying this on back of hands.<br />Works with my current skincare products (facial wash, toner, facial oil, mask 2x/week)<br />Solution has not turned brown or discolored (kept refrigeration)<br />My skin feels tighter (firmness)<br /><br />Cons:<br />A slight odor, I can’t place<br />Not a significant difference in wrinkle improvement (50- beginning of smile lines, chin and forehead wrinkles).<br />No feurlic acid (this has been shown to work synergistically with Vitamin C)<br />Lasts 3 months and needs refrigeration (expiration date is on box)...since very little is needed and use is 2-3x/week- I expect it will expire before all product is used. Would love to see this in powder form for longevity.<br /><br />Conclusion: A lot of thought was put into formulating and, bottling this product. If opting for “serum” over “powdered” Vitamin C- this is a good option. I’m always hesitant to try products that are not EWG Verified.

5.0,Smaller Pores !!!!,"Let me start off by saying I have combination skin and have not had great luck with many mud masks, but, Dead Sea mud seems to be what works for me. Ok I've had luck with a couple mud masks on here and one of those I really liked but,... I can only use the one I really loved every couple of months because it has peel like ingredients and that's not the type of mask to use weekly or bi weekly . This type of mask could be used at least weekly without harsh affects. I was definitely skeptical about the smaller pores claim but it's true !!!! I had my daughter do a video on her iPod and even though it wasn't really noticeable in the mirror afterwards to me at least, on the video the larger pores I have were actually smaller. I cannot figure out how to upload a video from anything other then my iPad so later this week I'm going to get a video or pictures on my iPad so I can post the difference. It's crazy how a mud can do this much without me noticing any major intenseness that I get from my other favorite mud mask, so pretty much I'm getting results without the burning, oh and this is also WAY more then what I get in the jar of my other stuff. So a. It's more, b. It's more affordable, c. It's easier on my skin and yeah you get the picture,. This is definitely the best mud mask you can get for the money and it really shrinks your pores, or my pores at least. My combination skin feels good and &#34;normal&#34; for two to three days after. Now that might not be a lot to you, but for me it's a miracle because usually by day two I'm oily on my problem areas and that's not fun. I highly recommend this mask to anyone looking for an affordable mask that'll last a long time, meaning it's not a ridiculously small jar.I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me.

I also want to mention that after a few days of using the brush, it is such a wonderful brush -- it has a firm feeling as it goes across my long, but very fine hair, and doesn't rip and tear at it the way most brushes made of synthetic materials do.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BtyJiPGFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BtyJiPGFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BtyJiPGFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08THQX1P8,B08THQX1P8,AHJOS7HNSO3SU7OY77Z3XURDIEIQ,1616592142983,0,False

1.0,Smells good but …,"Have you ever heard of the saying hair like a ‘rat’s nest’?<br /><br />Waited a few days between washing to try this variety of shampoo.<br /><br />Bought one of each of the four bars. By smell picked this as my favorite. Tried it first.<br /><br />Made certain to lather my hair well. It's long to mid back. I'm in my mid-fifties. Sharing this because of hair texture and type change as we age.<br /><br />This may not work for me, but can be for your hair.<br /><br />Currently, use Loreal hair color every few months. Sharing this because this may affect shampoos.<br /><br />Anyhow, used that bar on the top and under the back and made certain my hair was soapy, and rinsed it completely.<br /><br />My long hair was matted to my head.<br /><br />This is not normal. I've tried other bar soap to wash my hair before and the effect is similar. I'm wondering if it's because of the ingredients of soap.<br /><br />I slathered lots of conditioning balm on my now gauze-textured hair.<br /><br />In about five minutes my hair was soft and manageable. Able to run fingers through it.<br /><br />If I was a man this would work probably. Maybe other women with different textured hair would function better than mine did following shampooing with this bar.<br /><br />I've got three others to try, so who knows.<br /><br />My preferred shampoo is this brand in the bottle in the honey variety.<br /><br />Prior loreal no sulfite shampoo began acting weird.<br /><br />I've consistently used a chlorine filter in the shower and tub so not sure other than my hair texture has changed over time or the city water maybe.<br /><br />Seeing Drew Barrymore mention this shampoo gave it a try since we have similarly textured hair.<br /><br />It's amazing. My hair looks awesome. A huge relief from what the other stuff failed to do.<br /><br />Having the Whole Blends sulfite-free delivered on the sub and save in Honey Blend. Hoping it does as good a job.<br /><br />In regards to the shampoo bars, they make nice soap. Depending on how the other few works may end up changing the soap bar jobs.<br /><br />I don't like two of the scents. But if it works on my hair may use it anyway.<br /><br />⭐️ because this product doesn't function in a way that cleans ad softens my hair. Rather than creating a pot of spaghetti twisted and stuck together after being drained, but not rinsed.<br /><br />If a comparable conditioner in a bar is available I’d pay to try it. Until then, will not use this variety in my hair again.

You’d have to be a complete back sleeper that doesn’t even lean their head to the side for it to be comfortable. I am going to keep them and try for daytime use on the weekend (e.g., put on in the morning and wear throughout the day for a night time event). For me, I’d prefer just using a good heat protectant and a curling iron to get the same effect. I do know people that love these so it's worth a try, I just have no idea how they can sleep with them in! Also, I think the kind with the flat top might be easier to put in and wear. Having the large round part rolling around when you wrap your hair around is kind of annoying.<br /><br />Edit: I tried spritzing my dry hair a couple times and applying it, wearing for an hour and blow drying carefully with low heat and air flow and my hair was still damp in some spots so it didn’t hold a curl. So plan on making sure you it hair is BARELY damp and wearing for a LONG time for it to be dry enough to take out.",[],B09CLJT9QB,B09CLJT9QB,AHMHULZNI5CHZCZGMQ6W4DN6V73A,1640107889600,2,True
4.0,Love the #5 rosy brown color!!,"I’ve purchased this Kiko Milano eyeshadow stick in two colors from different amazon sellers. This one #5 (rosy brown) and the #7 (golden beige). I really loved the #5 color. It’s a beautiful neutral that can be applied darker or lighter depending on your preference. It also has obvious glitter particles which I like in comparison to solely “shimmer”. It is very blendable with your finger or brush.<br /><br />I did notice some differences between the two colors I purchased, but I’m not sure if it is a consistent shade problem or if I just purchased an older #7. The #7 I purchased was much drier and did not apply as smoothly as the #5. I did also experience glitter fall out which I did not experience with the #5 color.<br /><br />I’m rating this #5 color with 4 stars because it met my expectations but I think there are other products that are slightly more expensive with higher quality.

I also experienced some glitter fall out, but I think if I modify my application (use my finger instead of a brush to blend), I might be able to mitigate the fall out.

5.0,Just as good as KONAD....or better,"I got my nail plates and they are great. I have a few of the name brand Konad nail art plates and they are exactly the same, but better. They have more designs per plate and they have a lot of different designs to choose from. They work just as well as the Konad plates.<br /><br />I would suggest still using the Konad Special polish because like the Konad plates, a lot of regular store polishes don't work so well with the stamper. Metallic nail colors of any brand work well. Also, you can make your nail polish thicker by placing it in the fridge, so that will also help with getting the image to transfer.<br /><br />If you have wide nail beds you'll have to improvise on the full nail designs because they aren't as wide as the Konad plate versions. I only have issues with my thumb and i've fixed it by just putting polish on half the stamp and doing the part that isn't covered with the first stamp.<br /><br />Also, The edges of the plates are kind of sharp, but you could probably take a metal file or dremel and file around the disc's if it bothered you or you were concerned about it. They aren't too bad and since I just set mine on a paper towel I don't notice except when i'm putting it away.<br /><br />They all come with a protective wrapping on them so MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE IT before trying to stamp. it's plastic and i just used my nails to get it to come up off the plate for stamping.<br /><br />The price is amazing and the amount of stamp designs you get is awesome.

3.0,This Is Poorly Designed,"While this Aoraem collector can pick up some small particles, the suction it produces isn’t that great, so it leaves a lot behind. If you add the small hose attachment, then its suction power lessens even further. It was doing a halfway decent job at cleaning my keyboard, but the attachment kept falling off. The little bristles aren’t really helping anything and they are very harsh on my large mouse pad, which is what I mostly use these for. My old collector has a small lever you push to turn it on. The Aoraem requires you to turn the entire top half of the unit to power it. That’s fine for turning it on, but when you try to turn it off, it can loosen the bottom tray and the particles spill out if you’re not careful. It is easier to replace the batteries on this model versus my other one, but that’s the only thing I like about it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BopTNYKCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BopTNYKCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BopTNYKCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-4-jGmwRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-4-jGmwRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-4-jGmwRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MwBiDPX8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MwBiDPX8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81MwBiDPX8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81b5609fzaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81b5609fzaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81b5609fzaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09571TNVG,B09571TNVG,AEZY3WQ5CO4DOXRNJOWWXJYKCAXQ,1632173708221,0,False

3.0,"Smells Good, But Nah","I enjoyed the smell of this Jagat almond oil. It reminds me of the royal hair grease that I used as a kid. I’ve never tried this type of oil before and usually just add jojoba as my hair oil leave in. The consistency of the Jagat was very watery, but perhaps that’s how it’s supposed to be? I do question the amount of actual almond oil this has though, because it’s listed as the 3rd ingredient with mineral oil being the first. Anyway, I tested a good amount on my hands before trying it on my head and I’m so glad I did. I do not like this at all. It made my hands tingle, itch and slightly feel like they were burning. The sensation lasted a good 15 minutes after I had washed the product off.

3.0,Hard To Open and It Leaks,"I had a very hard time removing the cap from the base. There are no instructions and I kept thinking I was twisting the wrong way but no, it’s just extremely difficult to twist it to the right the first few times you open it. It gets slightly easier if you do it several times. The clip that stops it from accidentally spraying is also hard to remove, once you figure out the correct way to put it in that is. While it does maintain a continuous spray based on the number of times you pull the pump, it also leaks at the base connection if the bottle is angled. I always angle the bottle whether I’m spraying plants or spraying my hair, so this bugs me. To stop it from leaking, I would have to fill the bottle up just half way, which means more refills. The spray has a wide area and mists well, but the bottle is a hassle.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b2B07o1fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b2B07o1fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b2B07o1fL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NN7G1DSdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NN7G1DSdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NN7G1DSdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Rd+cY+qFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Rd+cY+qFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Rd+cY+qFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81W7B3wKQqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81W7B3wKQqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81W7B3wKQqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08JCMFWBK,B08JCMFWBK,AEZY3WQ5CO4DOXRNJOWWXJYKCAXQ,1605820883594,0,False
3.0,Too Tight On Me,"I know these wig grips need to be tight in order to work properly and stay on your head, but my goodness it’s headache inducing. I also can’t imagine that this is good for my natural hairline or edges. You can’t put it too far down on your forehead either or it will yank your eyebrows up. And if you wear glasses it will interfere with putting them on and off. The wig absolutely stays attached to the grip though, so hopefully I can find some in different sizes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C9QMN6m4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C9QMN6m4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C9QMN6m4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V6u2ZheeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V6u2ZheeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V6u2ZheeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/910WsYwCdyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/910WsYwCdyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/910WsYwCdyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08GWT454V,B08GWT454V,AEZY3WQ5CO4DOXRNJOWWXJYKCAXQ,1605669195572,2,False
3.0,Seems Overpriced,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this makeup organizer, but overall, I’m just not impressed with the quality compared to the price. Based on the material used I feel like it shouldn’t cost more than $30. The lid on mine had a few scuff marks on it but not too bad.

5.0,Actually Made Breathing Easier,"Since this is silicone, I expected this 3D bracket to be sort of malleable. However, it’s rather hard, but not uncomfortable. It fits fine on my face and didn’t cause any skin irritation. At first it felt cool to wear, but the longer I had it on the more it just became the same temp as my body. I was able to hook the bracket into the pleats of my surgical mask. After some adjustment I found the top pleat to be best as it stopped my mask from creeping up to my eyes like it usually does. I didn’t have any issues with the bracket slipping around inside. Even when I was talking it stayed put. Best of all, this bracket did actually make my breathing easier without compromising the fit of my mask.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614KNRKUXwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614KNRKUXwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614KNRKUXwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711tVLhF59L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711tVLhF59L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711tVLhF59L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FenqM+FJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FenqM+FJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FenqM+FJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KWnEIGKsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KWnEIGKsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KWnEIGKsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SnI3fu3RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SnI3fu3RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SnI3fu3RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T2aHmw6qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T2aHmw6qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T2aHmw6qL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08FBHNBP1,B08FBHNBP1,AEZY3WQ5CO4DOXRNJOWWXJYKCAXQ,1598993431614,1,False
3.0,Irritated My Skin,"Though the bristles are very soft to the touch, once they start rubbing against your face, they feel slightly rough.

2.0,So Bad,"This 14 inch bob wig is poorly constructed and weirdly styled. The part is off centered, but not so much to be considered a side part and it’s sewn to a hard piece of plastic. The wig is much shorter in the back which would be okay if the cut wasn’t chopped up and angled awkwardly. It’s very thin in the top and the cap bunches up in spots so that you can clearly see the wefts in the crown. There are no clips and the cap is a bit large but quite comfortable. The hairline is badly done. The fabric of the cap extends past the hair and is clearly visible. If you are looking for something super cheap to wear there are better options. If you want a wig that you can learn styling on or use to test heated products on then this is the one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EDN9uvNBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EDN9uvNBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EDN9uvNBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61McOQkxkhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61McOQkxkhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61McOQkxkhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712MdJ30IEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712MdJ30IEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712MdJ30IEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XTIltBVFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XTIltBVFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XTIltBVFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mH59zn2mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mH59zn2mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mH59zn2mL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sUr5MwLzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sUr5MwLzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sUr5MwLzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-t42mijbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-t42mijbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-t42mijbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811nHe-JWHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811nHe-JWHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811nHe-JWHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G96iWLF3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G96iWLF3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G96iWLF3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IenoKVM-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IenoKVM-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IenoKVM-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bLCN5YBQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bLCN5YBQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bLCN5YBQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bl8NdyaGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bl8NdyaGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bl8NdyaGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ydjNc9V6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ydjNc9V6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ydjNc9V6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Q44Q9GJ,B07Q44Q9GJ,AEZY3WQ5CO4DOXRNJOWWXJYKCAXQ,1582412971593,2,False

I was very surprised to receive the package and it came with the wig which is wrapped in a hairnet keep it from tingling in the box and also came with a package of bobby pins and a wig cap which I was worried I had a purchase in addition to this but I'm so glad that it came with it.<br /><br />The wig at edge of your hairline does look fake and it could be hard to work with but I think you could definitely wear it with a  baseball cap or a beanie over this week and it would look really cute which is how I plan on wearing it. I love the stone gray color it's not too light and silvery but it's a very nice toned down gray and it's so beautiful as you can see in the pictures it's very long .. comes down to about my mid back and it doesn't tangle that easily which is nice. It's very bouncy and I love it!! I definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a long gray wig.<br /><br />I did purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718gfHDBrlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718gfHDBrlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718gfHDBrlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+JbvwsprL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+JbvwsprL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+JbvwsprL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814s3elqy7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814s3elqy7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814s3elqy7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817eRnMO7dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817eRnMO7dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817eRnMO7dL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CyqAprs-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CyqAprs-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CyqAprs-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eeieiYxyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eeieiYxyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eeieiYxyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01F87QMVK,B01F87QMVK,AELHX3SODSPSMM7JIYVN24WKXRUA,1464502920000,4,False
4.0,Needs better instructions - doesn't have self timer! But does clean well,"I've been using my Clarisonic on and off for the past few years and it's a pain to purchase the replacement brushes for that. It also kind of grosses me out that the bacteria can live in those bristles..the ones that are supposed to DEEP CLEAN you face! I've been wanting to try the Foreo Luna for a while but that costs $200!  this item looks almost identical to that Luna cleansing brush. My friend uses her Luna and swears by it now. I compared hers to this one and i think the shape of this facial brush is a lot more practical since it comes to that point at the top which is great around the eye, nose, mouth areas. However, looking at the Luna bristles and the bristles on this unit you can tell the Luna has their bristles closer and also has a great variety of  brush levels which their claim is to more efficiently cleanse the skin meeting the specific needs of different facial areas... compared to the Sytles II, this unit only has 2 types of bristles.  The Luna says it cleanses with 8,000 pulsations per minute, but this unit says it can &#34;reach 32,000 times per minute massage design if high frequency vibration&#34; ...which i'm not sure how true that is..and what that even means.... what is 32,000 times? What is it referring to?...this leads me to my other gripe with this product...........the instructions!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I wish this unit had BETTER INSTRUCTIONS...I was reading it and i'm so confused - it doesn't say how many modes it has and what each mode is used for..but it mentions &#34;modes&#34; have eight gears?<br /><br />Here's the &#34;operation&#34; instructions..please try to decipher what it means... and yes i know there's typos..but that is how it READS on the instruction manual...&#34;each mode has eight gear, may adjust the intensity according to your needed. According to the intermediate key open product cleaning mode for the first tiem. According to the second closed products the intensity of each mode can be though the + and - buttons to increase&#34;............excuse me what? anyway ...<br /><br />Here are my instructions!!!<br />1.) Charge the unit to full before first use. Flashing means it's charging and when it stops blinking it is fully charged.<br /><br />2.) Wet the unit and your face, apply some face wash and turn the unit on to cleanse your whole face for 2 minutes. This unit has 2 modes, cleanse and massage. When you press on the button between the - and + you have it on cleanse mode (the faster vibration) and you can adjust the vibration intensity higher or lower depending on what you prefer. When you press the middle button again it turns off ..when you press it one more time it will turn onto the massage mode (slower vibration) you can adjust the speed of vibration in this mode as well.<br />  -The unit does NOT have a self timer so don't expect this unit to shut off after 2 minutes of cleaning. It also says it has &#34;acoustic cleaning&#34; which i thought meant it would beep every 30 seconds indicating you should move to another part of your face (ex. left cheek, right cheek, chin and then forehead - like the clarisonic does) but does NOT so you need to keep track of how long you want to wash your face for with this.<br /><br />3) Shut the unit off when you're finished by clicking the middle button between the - and +. Pat the unit dry or leave it where it can air dry.<br /><br />One thing i like about this type of facial brush is that you don't need to replace any brush heads on this unit - it makes for more hygienic. This Styles II facial brush also claims to reverse signs of aging and restoring youth in your skin. I'm only 27 so i can't really speak to this claim, i don't have may wrinkles but i hope this is a great start for preventative measures.<br /><br />This unit also claims to be a durable travel sized facial brush - it feels very light weight which i like because i don't want a bulky unit, i really like that the cord is very small and doesn't need a stand charging unit like the clarisonic. I haven't used this enough to know how long one charge can hold but I'll let you know once i continue to use this consistently. Be sure to read the instructions because it says you NEED to charge the unit fully before your first use. When you plug it in you will see the light at the bottom to start flashing indicating that it is actively charging. I hope this unit will last forever as it claims - wouldn't that be AMAZING! :)<br /><br />I've already used this unit last night and i can say that my face felt very smooth and clean afterwards. I think it really preps the skin well for your serums and treatments at night, which is KEY for those products to work. If you don't exfoliate and clean your skin - it won't allow your products to actively work!<br /><br />I'm really excited for the 100% money back guarantee! I've only had this unit for one night so I don't know how i like it yet for the long term but I'm glad that this warranty is here in case it doesn't work well for my skin or if it breaks....<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Compact and easy to travel with<br />• Cute color!<br />• Comes with a charging cable ...which it came with a case too.<br />• Waterproof so you can use it in the shower<br />• Rechargeable - you can see the image where I'm charging the unit and the light is blinking. Once it stops blinking i'm assuming that is when it's fully charged.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• The plug for the adapter to connect seems like it could rip over time - you can see it in the picture, it's very flimsy...<br />• The user manual has very odd grammar and is hard to understand which side is for &#34;massaging&#34; and which side if for &#34;cleansing&#34;.  PLEASE edit your instructions so we all understand how to properly use it.<br />• Does NOT have a self timer and it does NOT beep to indicate when to move to another part of your face like the clarisonic or Luna do.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review. I love face products and purchasing things on Amazon so this is truly my honest review.  I think this is worth the $40 price tag for what it does. All in all - the Styles II facial brush does clean the face well, the vibrations are something to get used to.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XQds+kAhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XQds+kAhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XQds+kAhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41keWE74fwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41keWE74fwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41keWE74fwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518LxtDMIEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518LxtDMIEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518LxtDMIEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L4kAk7nJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L4kAk7nJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L4kAk7nJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NtONMm4dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NtONMm4dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NtONMm4dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jYrBC9ZkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jYrBC9ZkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jYrBC9ZkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ncZZRFPfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ncZZRFPfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ncZZRFPfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSb0Pug2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSb0Pug2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSb0Pug2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51slfXj8nlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51slfXj8nlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51slfXj8nlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AU4Z2TE,B01AU4Z2TE,AELHX3SODSPSMM7JIYVN24WKXRUA,1455140242000,27,False

5.0,Buff your way to beautiful skin,"In the past I have used loofah sponges in solid form that still had seeds in it, and the sponges glued on wooden sticks . I wanted a softer more bendable loofah and these loofah pads do the trick. My hand easily slides in the elastic back. The backing fabric feels like ultra soft terry cloth. It is so soft my hand does slide around a little bit over the fabric when its dry  I was initially wondering if it would slip off my hand, but it molds to my hand and becomes easily pliable once wet and more grippy. It has enough flat loofah attached to buff away dry skin  but not so rough to irritate my skin. I love that I can easily rinse and wring the water/soap out of it. Loofah in the whole or stick form does not wring out easily therefore it is not uncommon for parts of them to get dark and smell musty. These loofah pads are so pliable its easy to wring  out water  like a towel and has a convenient loop to hang dry. In theory they should not smell musty if water is dried quickly from them. I haven't had them long enough to see if they turn, since my solid one on a stick from local store didn't turn for weeks.  I have dry middle age skin and I love that this little loofah pad works away the dry skin to softness underneath. Part of an at home spa experience. Extra perk! it comes with 2 pads.

I received the holographic powder this afternoon and just finished my nails about 5 minutes ago. This is NOT a nail dip powder like Revel. The tiny small jar will probably do at least 100 nails based on the amount I just used for 10 fingers . Steps- You do your gel nails exactly like you always do them, and after your topcoat is cured, you take the eyeshadow applicator, barely dip it into the powder, and buff it over your nail like you are putting on eyeshadow but rub it in really well like blending. You do NOT dip your finger into the powder. You do NOT put it on your wet nail You put It on the dry topcoat, and buff it in, wipe off the excess with a dry brush or a cotton ball, then do another topcoat and cure that. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I am not sure how it will wear. I will update my review later. Please look at the online directions for this and don’t be stupid! I used several different colors of polish to test it out, and it even works over just the clear. I am going to try it with regular nail polish later and see how it works with that.",[],B01LAV3O6E,B01LAV3O6E,AGI4MK7XUI6BZSUEJOMQK2IHHBVQ,1523331242143,63,True

5.0,Perfect roller for someone who loves rose quartz,"This roller is pink quartz, and it doesn’t matter if you use Quartz or Jade! It’s a personal preference.<br /><br />To get get the best results, you should refrigerate this and only then use on your face after it becomes cold. Don’t freeze!<br /><br /> This works in the same fashion that muscle rollers work - they help break down the adhesions from muscle overuse leading to a decreased appearance of wrinkles. This also leads to significant lymphatic drainage. When using for this purpose, you need to ensure you’re not collapsing the fragile lymphatic pathways. If you do, don’t worry! It only takes about 48 hours for them to repair themselves. Read as - be gentle on yourself! A little pressure goes a long way<br /><br />You will see immediate results when the puffiness and fluid is rolled off your face, and brings a brightening glow by allowing your moisturizers and serums to be better absorbed!<br /><br />Try using once or twice a week at first, and work up after that. It can be as long or as quickly completed as you desire.<br /><br />This is also a very good tool to help relieve tension headaches by rolling around your temples and into your hairline - start from midline of forehead, and roll down, and out towards your ears and then slightly towards the jaw.

5.0,Soap+ wipes give your skin and sensitive areas that naturally hydrated feeling.,I love these wipes. I have been using the cool shower ice soap for over a year now.  The wipes are awesome. After a hard day of work or if I just wanna freshen up during the day. These are my go to wipes. They do not burn or irritate your skin such as some scented or perfume wipes can do when you have dry or sensitive skin such as myself. They actually feel like they hydrate your skin in a very natural way. The soap works great also your dry skin. Sometimes with scented soaps they can burn or irraiate areas such as groin areas in the hot weather. This soap cools that region and hyrdates it as well. I have been using the soap for a while I just tried the wipes and the wipes are a nice addition with the soap. I will definitely be buying a again.

3.0,High Molecular Weight is the Real King!,"I had been using High Molecular Weight HA for a couple of weeks on my face/ hair with nice moisturizing results. But at some point I read on beauty blogs and publications that since Low Molecular Weight HA is better absorbed through the skin, that it was a much better option for the face. Made sense to me. Because of this I bought a LMW HA serum to put on my skin. This serum felt differently, watery yet more drying that the HMW HA (HMW can initially feel a bit drying on the skin). My face also felt irritated ( I have acne-prone skin) after the first days of using it. I still decided to buy this powder and the results very similar to the serum I bought.<br /><br />So I decided to do some research on the difference between both, the HMW and the LMW, because I could not understand why the LMW, which is supposed to be a far better option for the skin (according to the beauty industry) , did not give me the good results I have with the HMW. Interestingly enough I found this: &#34;Transepidermal water loss increased by 55.5% with low-molecular weight , and was reduced by 28% with crosslinked resilient , and by 16% with HMW&#34;. So more water loss with LMW? Not good.<br /><br />I also noted this: &#34;There is abundant experimental evidence from the human physiology and biochemistry literature to support the basic notion that LMW-HA is inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and associated with adult scarring phenotypes rather than fetus-like, scar-free, truly regenerative healing.  The latter is what we want in an any aesthetic procedure, or topical adjunct to a procedure, or just for topical use.&#34; This part here may explain why my face felt irritated and even got a mild breakout after using the LMW HA. More info on this on Barefacedtruth. They have detailed explanation and comments on this.<br /><br />I did give this product a 3-star because it is nicely packaged, has the detailed info on the product, etc. 2 stars down for being marketed as a potent moisturizer.",[],B00JG8DY0A,B00JG8DY0A,AFEOQZ7V5WXEKIIPXME6XNLQQIUQ,1487728133000,13,True

I know that sounds silly but people trying to put their hair up alone will appreciate what I mean.  The pins also come in a handy plastic cup instead of a thin piece of useless cardboard.  I appreciated that as well.  I know it is strange to write such a glowing review about bobby pins but I have had a difficult time finding truly silver ones plus ones that also are easy to open.

5.0,Best styling product for thick curly hair. EVER.,"I have tried KCCC (leaves hair crunchy and needs lots of maintainance between application), hair gel (as a daily wash-n-go) and then I found THIS. I  went to the salon as recommended by a friend and learned how to apply it. I use it to set my hair under a hood dryer or as a wash-n-go, or just air dry and I ALWAYS get great results. Hair doesn't frizz and and keeps a consistent curl pattern. I don't run from humid weather and my curls come out different depending on the humidity if I air dry it -but never frizzed! I wash and reapply every 3 (as instructed) to 5 days (when I'm cheating). I recently went to Miss Jessie's bc a friend told me their styling products last a week but I found the routine to have too many steps so back to Curly Whip. A 32 oz bottle lasts me approx 6 weeks - I have 3C hair. I used to use the Hair Rules shampoo and conditioner but I have also had good results with other brands and the curly whip.<br /><br />Please resume carrying the 32 oz bottle!",[],B001V6SN5G,B001V6SN5G,AFCSOVFPQWIHKEPPXPL3PVBTOU2A,1375308213000,11,True

I would recommend using this in lieu of the original colors only if you have a steady hand.<br /><br />The pros were that it lasted just as long (about seven days before chipping and ten before needing to be redone) and it was easier to take off (I only needed to scrape with an orange wood stick and not the metal tool)",[],B00K3BHUHC,B00K3BHUHC,AGREONS6LDFOCSJCILRFEFLRBYFA,1408372885000,1,False

The only negative here is that this is pretty occlusive as opposed to moisturizing for me.  I felt like my skin was still dry even after using this for several days.  I went back to my SkinFix Cream and it has really helped so much more than this cream.  I think this cream would be better used as a sleeping pack/occlusive to lock your other moisturizers in, but I do not think this moisturizer is enough by itself.

1.0,Whats the deal with the hype of this? AVOID!,"Okay so I received this about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />First impressions:<br />Upon opening my package, I noticed the box was already sort of opened and not sealed... I assumed it's because it is a cheap product.  I also noticed that in the serum, I had white clumps which I assumed was due to the freezing temperatures outside at the time.  I also noticed this product had a very astringent smell -- similar to alcohol.<br /><br />Usage:<br />I had been using it twice daily after cleansing, toning, and my essence.  I am used to using a serum, but this product seriously made my face super red every time I applied it.  I assumed it was due to a niacin conversion on my skin, but after a couple weeks, I started breaking out more than ever.  I noticed that my skin was completely sensitive, red, and everything would sting my face.  I did not think it was this product at first, but after i stopped using this product completely, the redness and sensitivity stopped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Do not buy this product.  In my case, this product made my skin worse than it has ever been along with being super crazy sensitive.  I do not recommend this to anyone, but perhaps I received a bad batch?  The lot/manufacturing stamp on the product is ""8LB"" if anyone with the same lot/manufacturing stamp is having a similar issue...<br />However, if you are looking for a niacinamide+zinc formula, I would recommend Revolution Skincare Niacinamide+Zinc from Ulta instead.

I bought the double magnets prior, where one set goes behind your lashes and the other set in front and they never really met up properly so I never used them. I don't like the glue because it always takes my real lashes off. So magnetic liner ""YES Please""!  I did watch some YouTube videos prior to buying to see how to put them on properly. I put a thin line on first with no luck, so I put a thicker (much thicker) line on and waited a bit before putting my lashes on. I'm not sure if it is truly magnets that hold them in place or just the goo/glue substance of the liner? I will say that with magnets you feel a ""pull"" sensation where the magnets are drawn together, I never got that feeling with this liner so my guess is... it is more the goo of the liner that holds them on (still better than glue). Either way, I have them on and I hope the goo holds up for the entire day!  :)<br /><br />UPDATE: After wearing these eyelashes for a full day they stayed on without any issues!

5.0,THE Standard in premium shaving,"I've tried at least a dozen shave soaps, maybe two dozen.  MWF is my go-to, standard. I leave it in a shave bowl in a drawer.  I rinse my brush and then swirl the dripping wet brush on top of the soap.  In about 20 seconds, you have phenomenal lather.  Wet and repeat for more water if needed. Lather around your face further as needed.  I often do this, then take a shower and repeat the lathering when I get out of the shower, and then shave.<br /><br />I have found a few artisan soaps that lather as good, but none better.  Those artisan soaps often come in a variety of delightful fragrances, but I don't care that much about fragrance.  MWF doesn't have much of any fragrance.  In fact after having wet it and let it dry a few dozen times, there is no discernible scent of any kind.  If you like the smell of MWF (or any other shave soap), keep it in a covered container between uses.  I'd suggest for those who like fragrance in their shave soap to just put MWF in a covered container and sprinkle in a little of their favorite cologne a few times and keep it covered and you'll have a $40 artisanal shave soap!<br /><br />I like the ingredients.  It's tallow based which I prefer.  There's lanolin in it which I like.  Although it's not a glycerin based soap, there is a little glycerin in the ingredients - it doesn't seem to be a large amount, so if you really like glycerin, get some vegetable glycerin on Amazon and sprinkle it on top of the soap or add it to your pre-shave.  It doesn't have shea butter in it, so I sometimes keep an open puck of shea butter shave soap in a shave dish next to MWF and occasionally reach down with my brush and lather from both.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews that say that it doesn't lather all that well in &#34;hard&#34; water.  We have moderately hard water in my city and I've never had trouble at all.<br /><br />Finally, it's cheap!  I lather before showering; after showering, and usually a second time while shaving, and my brush is full of lather when I finish and my single puck will last for maybe 300 shaves?? so maybe 4 cents a shave??<br /><br />Also,",[],B001LY7FRK,B001LY7FRK,AF6ROQSUO4A3ODLMUY4Z22MJTYNQ,1425576069000,7,True

It took about three days to notice a visible difference.  A little bit of a sting at first....sensitive skin....  and then softer skin around the eye area after a few days. It is fast acting and a little goes a long way.  Love the bottle.  Pleasing to the eye and looks good on the counter top.  I love not having to dig around the jar for cream.  It dispenses from the top.  Yes, there was a tiny bit of a sting but that went away fast.  My friend always uses argan oil on his face and I do the same.  Often, I am just looking for a little extra eye protection and so does my friend.  I give this five stars and I did buy this for a friend who loves it.  Fantastic if you don't use too many facial products and goes well with the argan oil.  The only drawback is the light sting but I can live with it.",[],B01HIIT4TE,B01HIIT4TE,AF3YIS46TGVXNVAWY3RZ6T6KSCWQ,1479549615000,0,False

5.0,I’m satisfied,"I soak and wash the hair in vinegar 3x before installing then use herbal essences so it smells nice. If it ever had a smell, I wouldn’t know it but I do know that when I’ve used other brands and washed them sometimes the color still came off on my clothes and this does not have that problem. The colors are vibrant, the hair is soft..... it’s itch free mainly because of my vinegar rinse and it looks good for the install after all that initial manipulation. I used 6 packs for my current look in color and threw in half a back of black in the back and it turned out lovely. This is the Pre twisted variety. I love it, shipping was fast and this hair is very light weight.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AZLr-NJFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AZLr-NJFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AZLr-NJFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V343YTT,B07V343YTT,AEE4PLBNOIF2VU2PB5V4VM4UGJHQ,1604109005184,0,False

3.0,Bribery only works if you have something to bribe with...,"So apparently scrunchies are back in style? Anyway, I was coerced into buying these, and they turned out to be a great value for the price.<br /><br />To put it into perspective, a single velvet scrunchie at Claire’s or Icing is $7, and this was $4.99 for a whole pack. The scrunchies are all decent quality... a nice variety of colors that are displayed accurately in the product photos, good stitching, hidden seams and no holes or flaws in the seams that I can see. They all have varying degrees of tightness as another reviewer mentioned. This is fine... some can be worn to bed or for more relaxed, messy ponytails. Some are all business. Well, as “business” as a scrunchie can be.<br /><br />Anyway, the only reason that I rated these 3 stars and not 5 is because they included a sheet of paper, telling me to enjoy my complimentary gift in exchange for a high star rating. And then they regretfully forgot to include my bribe- I mean, my gift. This is kind of a shady way of doing business in my opinion, as I believe product reviews should be honest and accurate in describing the product and the details.<br /><br />Anyway, if you’re looking for cheap scrunchies, these are a great option.

I use it during my bath time making it convenient and easy to wash off.<br /><br />The mask is nice and cooling. It was easy to apply during my bath and rinsing off was easy peasy. The scent was meh!

I rather reduce the cost to produce in a jar or tube.<br /><br />As for the eye cream, it has a nice and refreshing cucumber scent.  I like the scent!  The eye cream syringe is easy to use.  All you have to do is take the cap off and push the plunger to dispense.  I use the eye cream for over two weeks and it helps with dark circles and puffiness.

After using it, I didn’t find it practical and won’t continue to use it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-This is an all in one product so you have the comb and gel together. Sometimes when I travel, I forget one or the other.<br />-The product smells really good. It has a spicy scent with a hint of soap.<br />-This provides all day hold for your hair, without the need to touchups. Gives the hair a stiff and crunchy feel.<br /><br />Considerations:<br />-This will work best if you have a few inches of length on top. I had just cut my hair so I only have about 2 inches in length to work with. It provided a decent side combed style, but I wasn’t able to get the chunky sections that I would have with longer hair.<br />-The product is a little messy to use. You need to quickly turn the comb over after pulling it out, otherwise the gel drips everywhere. Even when you turn it over, the gel flung into my sink.<br />-The comb for this is a little short.

5.0,I became an immediate fan,"This product has everything I like. A likeable backstory about the founders, produced in small hand crafted patches, and delivers the quality results that it promises.<br /><br />I wear my hair short (buzzed on the sides) with about 3-4 inches on top, which I style differently depending on the day. I usually like it combed to the side, and pushed back, but with volume to give it a nice swoop. My hair is fine, but a lot of it.<br /><br />I’ve never been a fan of pomade in the past because I find it doesn’t hold it’s shape and is too shiny. However, this pomade provides a natural looking shine, while holding my hair in my preferred style. The pomade itself is very light and thin. I didn’t think it would work when applying, but within seconds it began to form my hair into my go-to style. It dries to a “tacky” feel, which allows you to readjust throughout the day, but wouldn’t feel comfortable to run your fingers through it. After applying, the product easily washed off my hands, and out of my hair at the end of the day.<br /><br />The scent is good but not overwhelming. It has the typical “masculine” scent that you will find in deodorants, body wash, shaving cream, etc. for men. The scent lingers till you wash it out.<br /><br />Overall, I will definitely be using up this entire jar.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HjYSFuUPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HjYSFuUPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HjYSFuUPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NEWrxtLTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NEWrxtLTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NEWrxtLTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sPLO6WFJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sPLO6WFJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sPLO6WFJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07WVVHJ1K,B07WVVHJ1K,AGO2N635I4RNMKT5SM7XONDVKVDA,1584475820495,0,False

4.0,"Plenty of foot spas on Amazon...hard to choose, but I chose wisely.","It took me over 2 weeks to finalize my purchase of a foot spa from Amazon.  There are so many foot spas and tons of reviews for them all, but we're all looking for the best value here.  I finally pulled the trigger and purchased this model.  Our previous foot spa was purchased from Walmart and had a heater, massage rollers (manual rollers) and bubbles, roughly costing around $60.  So my budget for the next spa would be under $100.  Today was my first day using it (1.5 hour usage:)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Heater:  Works like a champ!  I put relatively hot water into the basin to begin with (Onboard thermometer read 101 degrees.)  I then increased that heat to 105 and it maintained that temp throughout the duration of my use...only slight temp changes to 106 every once in a while, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Shower / Waterfall:  I didn't think anything of this when purchasing it, as I felt it was a gimmick.  It's actually quite soothing and has a purpose here....I used it for probably 75% of the time.<br /><br />Automatic massage rollers:  Holy cow...they are strong, but feel absolutely amazing.  There are 6 separate massage rollers that have several white balls on each that do all the massaging.  The rollers are powered by a motor at the bottom of the unit with the drive shaft come directly up, center of the basin, which is a square shaped metal rod that fits into the bottom of the massage roller plate (which can be removed easily.)<br /><br />Deep basin:  I'm 6'3"", 200 lbs...water completely submerges my feet and ankles and as plenty of room to move my foot back and forth or side to side.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Handle:  There is a handle that folds flush with the unit, but beware....each side of the handle is connected to the basin with 2 small metal screws.  The entire handle and what it's connected to is plastic and doesnt feel secure when the basin is filled with water.  But there is plenty of surface area on the bottom of the unit to easily get ahold of it while moving and the wheels are big enough to set the unit on the floor without squishing your fingers in the process.<br /><br />Bubbles:  Not a con for me, but my wife likes bubbles...So I guess it could be considered a con?  Personal pref, but def not a deterant as this foot spa is great without.<br /><br />Top room / Control panel:  I wear size 12 male shoes...I have to point my feet downwards to enter the basin as the control panel is quite large.  Just as above, this isn't that much of a con as it is really just an ease of use thing.  Once your feet are in the water, you're in Heaven.<br /><br />Considering how much use we got out of our last foot spa, I can see us using this foot spa multiple times throughout each week.  Given that, I'll be sure to update this review as much as possible because I'm quite aware at how difficult it is to purchase a foot spa comfortably without questioning it's worth.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CVVGAwltL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CVVGAwltL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CVVGAwltL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NybnkfgrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NybnkfgrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NybnkfgrL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07KYYLL21,B07KYYLL21,AGQDUP3RR3BYI3S3QO4NT6IDHAMQ,1551499731935,99,True

Just don't expose the battery end (bottom half) to more than a short modest spraying of water and it should last a long time for you.  You can buy 3 of these for the price of the traditional model and works just as good.  Get your heads in 6-packs at Costco - much cheaper 6 for the Amazon/Wal-Mart price of 4.  Yes the heads are expensive but if you don't have braces or whatnot you probably can push a 6-month replacement cycle.",[],B000FEIOHW,B000FEIOHW,AF5ONG65JCG6P3RN5Q2XQSLPLRFA,1284165194000,3,True
4.0,"Great moisturizer, Smells Like Lemon Pledge Furniture Polish","First, as a moisturizer, this stuff is great.  My skin loves this, and it absorbs quickly and I only need to apply it once a day after a shower in the dry climate here in Colorado.  This even penetrates the hard skin on my feet well.  Overall it's a great moisturizer and worth the money...that is unless I'm going out in public.  The smell on this is pretty intense, to me, it smells like Lemon Pledge Furniture Polish.  I can handle the smell after becoming desensitized to it.  However, people have commented on the strong smell, with ""did you just polish your furniture or something"".  So if you want a great moisturizer and can handle the smell this is for you. One star was taken off for smell and this was a little expensive for me.",[],B07TS3W9X4,B07TS3W9X4,AGK6LHPXK7MZ6CM277LV4VFXQQCQ,1631786589798,1,True

5.0,Awesome,"Review for: 100% PURE Coconut Body Scrub<br /><br />I love body scrubs and I love when they have an oil base that that helps to fight winter dryness. This one has a wonderful oil base that coats my skin and really hydrates it. It also smells fantastic. Because this is oil based, it does leave any oily film on my shower floor.

5.0,Thank you Prairie Rose!,"Review for: Cocoa Butter Cream Peppermint Body Butter - Mint Cocoa Whipped Body Cream<br /><br />I love this body cream for so many reasons. To begin with, it arrived inside a clear bag with a silver tie, making me smile at the nice presentation. Being impressed with the packaging was nothing compared to the wonderful aroma that I was treated to when I peeked under the seal and looked at the product. It looked like whipped cream cheese and smelled good enough to eat! The scent is a combination of chocolate and mint. Taking just a tiny bit of the cream in my hands to feel it let me know why it is called velvet body cream. It truly does feel velvety, silky and soft.<br /><br />I was able to appreciate all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is the real treat. This soft and silky cream is just fun to use. Getting out of the shower and dealing with dry skin in the winter is a pain and this product changes that. Instead of being in a hurry to get some lotion slathered on my skin so I can get dressed, I look forward to pampering myself with this product. I feels so good on my hands while I am applying it to my arms and legs. Of course it smells wonderful too but the really great part is how well it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.<br /><br />If you are looking for a gift for a friend that complains of dry skin in the winter, look no further. Your gift will be appreciated!",[],B08TB3DZ1D,B08TB3DZ1D,AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,1638291035413,1,False

The blades flows along the contours of my legs easily and does not cut me.

It is easy to change out the battery just by pulling the base off. There is an on/off button that slides and is easy to access.<br /><br />I am happy with the closeness of the shave.

It includes a full sized LED light, something not all kits do. You get a lot of smaller tools and accessories in this kit and you also get 10 colors of polish as well as well as a top coat and base.<br /><br />The polish itself has a nice consistency and the handles of the brushes are easy to use. They come with the colored dots on tops of the handles.

4.0,Good opportunity to try a lot of different products,"Review for: Burt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit With Ultra Gentle Lotion, 1 Count<br /><br />I have been a fan of Burt’s Bees products for years. I welcomed the opportunity to try this assortment.<br /><br />I found the bubble bath to be a good product for my household. Lots of bubbles, no scent that I could detect and an easy to use dispenser. The body wash/shampoo is fine as a body wash and I love the foam dispenser. It works ok for an infant as shampoo but I don’t like it as shampoo for a toddler with more hair. The wipes are great and I like the small package so they stay moist longer. The lotion is quite thin as most baby lotion is so you have to be careful when opening or dispensing it because you can find yourself with way more than you wanted very quickly. I also could not discern any scent on the lotion. The oil I only use to pour just a tad into a bath so soften and moisten the skin. You do have to be careful not to put too much in or the tub will become a slip and slide.<br /><br />Overall: Nice products, not perfect but would make a nice gift, comes in a gift box.",[],B08MC3ZLV4,B08MC3ZLV4,AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,1624639698784,0,False

I has really good lather, a strong pump and a wonderful scent. It lathers easily and also rinses out easily. I like how my hair feels after using it. I am not so much of a fan of the conditioner. I was a bit surprised that after putting it in my hair, my hair did not feel slick like it does with most conditioners. It actually felt quite coarse. I always brush my hair while in the shower with the conditioner still in it. I attempted that with this conditioner and found that not only did the conditioner not do any untangling, but I got the brush stuck in my hair! I then rinsed and rinsed to get it all out and then tackled the knotted hair. My hair acted as if I had not had any conditioner at all and I had to fight my way through the knots.

5.0,Great for moisturizing during the winter months,"My oils arrived in bottles with security seals beneath the lids. Each bottle has a cap but a pump accompanies each bottle as well. I much prefer the pumps for oils since they are thinner and it can be difficult to control a pour. During the winter months I use these oils as skin moisturizers. When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating. Using the scrubs also helps to moisturize.<br /><br />I found the oils to be fresh, no sign of a rancid smell. They both come in an amber colored bottle which is the best way to store them.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familiar with these types of oils, they are not scented. Neither oil has any type of scent at all and they are meant to be used as moisturizing products or carrier oils.<br /><br />Overall: really nice set of oils that are fresh and in the right type of bottle.",[],B08LYT4Q2X,B08LYT4Q2X,AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,1605736873530,0,False

Trying the other one on, I found that the ends that fit near the ears were very rough and got caught in my hair. I lost several strands of hair trying to get it off my head.<br /><br />Looking closer at the bands, they are made differently and that is why one appear to be stretched out. The gold one has a ribbon, or something like it, sewn over the ends. The colored one does not and so my hair catches on the little jewel things every time I try it. This is very disappointing. While I was looking the colored band over, trying to figure out why it caught in my hair, I noticed that the jewel pieces were already starting to come off the band on the top.<br /><br />The gold band is wearable at this time, the other one is not.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n-2x5AtoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n-2x5AtoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n-2x5AtoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xdOtIlDYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xdOtIlDYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xdOtIlDYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08F7WJLQH,B08F7WJLQH,AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,1599915227362,0,False

If you have never used good scissors, you may not know that these are poor quality and won’t do a good job on anyone’s hair.<br /><br />I was actually disappointed in the cape as I expected it to be a bit better than it is.

I have done it all to tame the volume and sponginess of it, but finally gave up as it was too time consuming. I have very little time to get ready in the morning before heading out to work, so I bought this brush to try it, since I am always looking for a solution. Now the verdict:<br /><br />It works well as long as you are not looking for a fast miracle. It heats up quickly and and goes through your hair like a regular brush. It dies tame unruly hair and gave me a flatish look very quickly, I went through my entire hair in less than four minutes and my back of the head volume went down and the sponge &#34;pyramid&#34; went down. I ended my few minutes long styling with balm and there! I looked human again and it lasted all day. My hair feels silkier and definitely looks like I spent more time styling it, but not salon styled of course. It suits my needs so I am keeping it. I would say it gives 68 percent flat hair, which is a good result considering the time invested, If you want to look like Hollywood star or the girl in the advertisement of the product, this is not for you, and you will need to go to 30 minutes blow dry and 30'minutes flat ironing if you want flat straight perfect results.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Attractive packaging<br />-It works if you have reasonable expectations<br />- Fast fair to good results<br /><br />Cons<br />- Product looks cheap and chintzy<br />- The brush's bristles are made out of very hard plastic, ouch!<br />- No glove included, although the handle doesn't get hot<br /><br />I am satisfied with the results. Now I can go to work without looking like a mop everyday.

It works better if someone can hold the end of long hair so that the ends get all the way straight. Her hair looked great and smooth.

4.0,"Easy to mix, works as advertised.","Good variety of scents and benefits. Would make great gifts or stocking stuffers. I do like that some of the same benefits can be found in multiple masks so you can reap the benefits over time instead of just randomly. It would be nice to have it by skin type individually too though.<br /><br />I like the concept of powder since it doesn’t dry out and it’ll keep longer. It states to use 30 ml of water which if you don’t have anything to measure that, the standard medicine cups are usually marked for that if you have those in your cabinet. I did have to use a tiny bit more as it became a paste initially.<br /><br />There is a lot of product in each tube. Honestly one could probably get away with using half at a time as the whole tube was enough for me to do down my neck as well and I put it on VERY thick. It does dry down though. If it’s too thin it is harder to peel. My skin felt plumped and moisturized. The scent is a bit artificial but more like a pleasant candle than something sickly sweet.

5.0,Natural looking.,"I bought this full lace wig, short notice order, and it arrived express. I wore the wig in Jamaica's humidity weather and it felt like a breeze. The wig is very lite (weight), air vents in the stocking cap therefore me scalp decrease sweating. The curls arent as tight as it appears. however the curls bounce back into place if you use big tooth pick comb or pluck with your fingers. This wig hair strings was stitched into the stocking cap perfectly. The parts shown after styling appears natural showing your scalp through the stocking cap.  Unfortunately the curls did not hold up after wetness from swimming on surface of pool water. The curls dropped giving the wig a slight under the chin length and neck length in the back. I haven't tried applying heat to re-curl the style. I was content with a second  look, same wig, hair style. I was able to lightly pull back into a piggy-tail.

I use the darker shade for contour under my cheekbones and the brick/blush color make your cheeks, chin, nose, and wherever else you place it look kissed by the sun. The colors last a long time and are highly saturated so you don’t have to keep brushing it on several times. A little goes a very long way.

Because it adheres directly to the wall, you have to do some occasional cleaning to keep mold at bay. I found a superior option in the Shave Well Company Deluxe Anti-Fog Shower Mirror, which hangs on a tiny hook suction cup. Because it hangs on a hook, that mirror can be removed and run under the shower water, thereby washing away the fog and keeping the mirror clean.

The adapter isn’t included but I use my phones charging adapter and it works fine), 1 Pink Nail File with strong grit on both sides of the file and a blue buffer on one side and then a white side on the back that I use to make my real nails shiny) and last but not least a small storage container with secure clasps and a handle for safe storage as well as a instruction booklet.<br /><br />THIS KIT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RUBBING ALCOHOL YOU MUST HAVE WHEN DOING THESE TYPE OF NAILS! Any rubbing alcohol will do (store bought is fine). DO NOT USE ACETONE (Nail polish remover it won’t work).<br /><br />This is a great beginners kit and I’m excited to actually try it out on actual my nails. I tried one nail not on me so I color practice since it was my first time doing these type of nails, and so far so good!<br /><br />The only con about this kit is I don’t like... #1 The UV lamp isn’t very powerful. I definitely suggest buying one that is more heavy duty and has higher wattage (you can always use it on gel nails or on regular polish to cut drying time in half) and #2 The nail color doesn’t have any way of telling which bottle is what color. I just took a dot tool and dipped it in the color and put a dot on the middle of the top of the poly gel nail polish cap (there’s a indented circle that it fits perfectly on) but it’s hard to see the darker blue when doing this but you’ll know what that color is by process of elimination 😉","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tewZrYwvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tewZrYwvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tewZrYwvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ttTlMpCDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ttTlMpCDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ttTlMpCDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHG9yBXML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHG9yBXML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aHG9yBXML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cZ8scJcxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cZ8scJcxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cZ8scJcxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jKBRqswqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jKBRqswqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jKBRqswqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l+XUvWlkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l+XUvWlkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l+XUvWlkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B087GB8ZRF,B087GB8ZRF,AHLA24J43UD2AKTINUBUWKEDPQHQ,1596444080841,10,False

The drying straps are also very innovative and great for large brushes that can puff out and lose their shape after repeated washes. These cups are so much better than the mats. My mat would always get gunked up with foundation and concealer but I have had no issue with the cups being difficult to clean. All I have to do is rinse them out when I’m done. The mesh bag is a nice touch and allows room for your bottle of brush shampoo. Very happy I bought this!,[],B01GU2NME2,B01GU2NME2,AGKUVNELSMHKPBCPUKFFQ4XMS3OQ,1512116953638,1,True

3.0,"Cheap, but Cheaply Made.","I've had these for almost a year but I haven't used them that much--there are a select few designs that I use regularly, but the majority have remained untouched. Here's why:<br />-A lot of my plates came damaged; maybe I'm just the unlucky one in a thousand, but many had imperfections in the metal that ruined the images. Other than that, the undamaged plates worked decently. You might run the risk of having damaged plates like me, but I'm guessing this was just my bad luck. Can't really blame the company since I never made the effort to return them, and it's been waaay past 30 days (at the time I was just happy I got them).<br />-I liked that there were themed and matching stamps, but to be honest I just don't like a lot of the images enough to actually use them. There is an unnecessary amount of tribal/swirly images, and what were they thinking with the ambiguous pair of chili peppers? Take a good look at the individual images and take that into account more than the sheer number of plates. Will you actually use them?<br />-Unless you have child's hands, the full-nail plates are waay too small--it's most noticeable on the thumbs and middle fingers, but they can barely fit over any of my nails (in terms of width, not length--I don't have crazy-long nails). To avoid awkward-looking nails, I haven't used many of the full nail stamps. Images like the polka-dots are easy to align and restamp, but others not so much.<br />-They come off a little blurrier than Konads, but nothing too horrible<br />-Some of the images are nice in theory, but don't show up that well once stamped. For example, there's a cute lace french tip that I just couldn't get to work because it was impossible to pick up the full image.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />-they're cheap, and most of the images are pretty crisp<br />-A lot of the full-nail designs have matching french tips<br />-The french tips will definitely (probably) fit over all your nails, including thumbs.<br />-I like the themed plates--for example, there's a Christmas one and a Halloween one.<br />-I've heard complaints that these plates were too sharp, but I don't see how you could accidentally hurt yourself with them--maybe they've updated their plate design?<br /><br />Although I haven't used many of the images, those I do use make the bundle worth it. The total price for all 21 image plates--damaged and unattractive though some may be--is the price of 3 Konad stamps. It's definitely worth the price, but I can't guarantee amazing quality.",[],B003ILUQPM,B003ILUQPM,AG6S3PFWK5JT3XONUBSJDF3FWVGQ,1307321274000,0,True

3.0,"Good, but not Great","It's a cute, gimmicky product. The packaging is adorable and well made. I will definitely wash it out and reuse it when I'm done with the sleeping pack. The product itself is fine, but a bit of a let down. I have very dry skin and use this as a last step in my nightly skin care routine and do feel it makes a difference. It has a light clean fragrance, but does not at all smell like black tea, as I had hoped it would. The consistency is gel like, but a lot stickier than I would prefer.

5.0,Kiss has the best nails! Instructions on how to make them last 10-14 days!,"These nails are GORGEOUS!!<br /><br />Do NOT use the sticky adhesive as they make the nails not last as long. Simply:<br />1. Push your cuticles back<br />2. File down your nails<br />3. Lightly file your nail bed so the glue has something a little rough to hang to, it’s always easier than putting glue and a nail on a smooth surface and makes them last much longer<br />4. Find the 10 nails that fit you and lay them down in the order of the fingers you will put them own (pink-ring-middle-index-thumb-thumb-index-middle-ring-pinky) - they have numbers on the underneath of the nail on the tip, remember those numbers or write them down because that’s likely your size in all Kiss nails (for example, I’m 12-10-7-8-3-3-8-7-10-12, the smaller the number the bigger the mail)<br />5. When you’re ready to apply, place glue on the bottom of the fake nail about 1/6 inch from the bottom to the middle of the nail and make sure it’s dispersed even - DO NOT put the glue directly on the nail bed, for longevity it works best to put it on the fake nail<br />6. Align with the appropriate finger and place down, holding for 5-10 seconds.<br />7. There may be a little glue that comes out on the sides. Be careful not to smudge that on the nail itself. Just take a paper towel and dab that little bit of glue up as you go<br />8. Once all nails are on, file how you need/want them and you are set for about 10 days.<br />9. I usually get a solid 2 weeks of wear out of mine! I use either these KGN10, the almond shaped wine, or I’ll do a French or natural French short length from Kiss.<br />10. Carry around an extra nail or two that may fit a couple different fingers for emergencies, the glue, and the nail file. If a nail pops off and it’s not a broken nail, simply file your nail bed again and apply glue to either a new nail that fits, or the one you popped off if it’s salvageable.<br /><br />Enjoy!",[],B081V4JG57,B081V4JG57,AH3GGLYG3OBEBIO3KMRPYW5D2LEA,1614847738880,1,False

After I finish using one, I do use a little soap on the cloth and rub it together just to get the darkest makeup off the towel.  That may be totally unnecessary though.

5.0,Move Over Palisade!!! Save Money & Time!,"I continue to be sort of amazed at all the cool nail art supplies that keep coming out!! Born Pretty is my favorite Nail Art Brand. I have several Born Pretty items already, and my collection continues to grow! I am so very glad that I found this product!! The set includes 26 different pieces of Nail Shields, that come in 10 different sizes, to shield the skin around your nails and cuticles from nail polish. With all the different sizes included, it is very easy to find the right sizes to fit each of your fingers (my right hand is slightly larger than my left hand, & most people are the same, with one side being just a tiny bit bigger than the opposite side). There is nothing complicated about these at all, you simply slip on each Nail Shield like a ring at the top of your finger tips. Each Nail Shield fits each finger fully and comfortably. The right fit will cover the skin around the nails snugly but also comfortably. After you have found your proper sizes, you can apply your nail polish neatly and precisely, without getting nail polish stains on your skin to clean up after!<br /><br />The directions say to wear the Nail Shields right-side-up, as shown in the pictures (with the curve facing up). This does a fabulous job at shielding the skin around the nail from polish. I find that it also works nicely if you turn them upside-down (with the curve facing down, going from cuticle from nail tip, like the letter U) and then they shield not only the skin around the nail, but the cuticle too!! I still have to make an effort to leave a little space between the cuticle and where the nail polish starts (should be slightly above the cuticle), so using the Nail Shields &#34;upside-down/letter U&#34; also makes a stencil which forces the little gap between cuticle and where polish begins, for a clean, precise, and professional look. (PLEASE SEE MY ATTACHED PHOTOS FOR REFERENCE!)<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, this latest neat and super handy innovation from Born Pretty is also Eco Friendly and Money Saving ++$$!! I have been buying bottles of Liquid Palisade to do the same job, whereas Born Pretty's Nail Shields can be re-used again and again. Palisade can get expensive...  Palisade can also be a real pain to get off, depending on the quality (some are thin in texture and don't come off easily or in one piece). Using tape is even more cumbersome, messy, and inacurate. I'm SO glad I found these!! I was also really fortunate to be able to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. It is a win/win situation, Born Pretty Is my favorite Nail Art Company because I love every item I have ever purchased from them! These Nail Guards will save me a bunch of money over time, and not just from having to purchase more palisade. They are practical, they work well, and I am really happy with my results! They save money, they save time, they are easy to clean up, and they last for countless uses!  You really can't go wrong with these :D","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DPeOjXJ1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DPeOjXJ1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DPeOjXJ1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcMDSXpiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcMDSXpiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YcMDSXpiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egYVC3+bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egYVC3+bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71egYVC3+bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v9GQ8H0aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v9GQ8H0aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71v9GQ8H0aL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01D8C3MCE,B01D8C3MCE,AHWPTGX6OD4D46LCQTQVRY4PPHTA,1468310236000,6,False
5.0,5 Drops Will Do Ya,"This is a very nice hair serum that is targeted at encouraging and speeding up hair growth. The first ingredent, and therefore the  most prevalent ingredient, is a type of silicone. Silicone has become the most popular ingredient for anti-friz and shine serums for hair, not to mention a whole world of cosmetics like oil free moisturizers and foundations. It has a slip to it, which gives silicone the *feeling of being like an oil, but it is by its nature, is totally oil free. And of course, also by its nature, it cannot clog pores or follicles. Infact, the Dae Long Hair Growth Serum formula contains three different types of silicone as its first three ingredients. The active ingredients in the product, or the ingredients that actually enable the product to do its job of encouraging hair growth, are Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Lupine Protein, and Panax Ginseng. These nourish and stimulate the hair follicles to remain longer in the anagen, or hair growing phase, and to produce healthier, stronger hair from the root. Jojoba oil is a skin compatible oil, meaning that it cannot and does not clog pores or follicles, closely resembles the body's own natural lubrication, and can be absorbed by human hair, skin, and nails. There is also extract of Macadamia Nut Oil, which moisturizes the hair cuticle and shaft and helps to prevent hair breakage and split ends. Hydrolyzed protein from the seeds of the lupine plant are very high in protein and contain 35-45% of all the essential amino acids. Panax ginseng is an extract from the panax ginger root and has nourishing and stimulating qualities that directly feed and nourish the hair follicle. I was fortunate to be able to order this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have used a great many hair serums and products to stimulate growth of stronger, longer, and healthier hair. One of my favorite things about this Dae Long Hair Growth Serum is that it has a very pleasant fragrance! I also really like that the ingredient list is simple, straightforward, and does not contain weird chemicals or scary preservatives!!! It has a very clean  feel to it, not leaving your hair greasy at the last part that you want to be greasy, the roots. A few drops goes a long way I say five drops will do. While pleasant, It is also important not to over do it!. I have very, very sensitive skin and had no problem at all with this. Time will tell how much it makes the hair grow. I am also taking a good hair, skin & nails vitamin because as a Licensed Esthetician, I know for a fact that you have to feed and nourish INSIDE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE in order to truly grow longer, stronger, and healthier hair!!",[],B01EST7TBQ,B01EST7TBQ,AHWPTGX6OD4D46LCQTQVRY4PPHTA,1467713711000,8,False

4.0,"IF your blowdryer is a match for this diffuser, you are going to want it for lift and volume. Nothing else compares.","Several years ago I had purchased a blowdryer with a similar attachment. I absolutely adored that thing - you could use it on the top of your hair or the sides to give lift so your hair had volume without using any product or doing any backbrushing. The thing was a miracle worker!<br /><br />Then we entered the era of pin straight hair, and volume and body were out. Thank God, we seem to be passing that era, but hairstyling implements seem to be lagging behind. I was dying to try this diffuser to see if it emulated the gizmo from long ago, and it does. Well made hair styling tool that gives lift and volume to your hair, I love it. Well, kinda.<br /><br />I'm not sure how 'universal' this is. I tried it on my current blowdryer, and it didn't fit. I had to go digging around until I finally found a Conair dryer upon which it fit, and the funny thing is that it fit like it was MADE for the dryer. The odd thing is that the Conair looks to have the same kind of nozzle the other blowdryer had, so go figger.<br /><br />IF you have a blowdryer that marries this diffuser well, this is definitely something you're going to want in your hair arsenal.

4.0,White-Out for lips; gives you the true color your lipstick was meant to be!,"This is going to sound really stupid, but I could never figure out why certain shades of pink lipstick never looked the same on my lips as they did in arm swatches. I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.<br /><br />I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.<br /><br />And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!<br /><br />This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. The only caution I'd say is you don't need to put on as much of this as I did; you'll just be wasting product, and there's no dry down when you overdo it!",[],B0099UG4AM,B0099UG4AM,AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,1457069458000,9,True
5.0,Pleasant change of pace from the Clarisonic,"I'm very big into skincare. Way before I got a Clarisonic, I used scrubbing sponges for daily exfoliation. This facial cleansing pad is a new one to my skincare arsenal. It seems to be a take on various Korean modes of skin cleansing that are currently popular.<br /><br />First off, let me say this sponge is very soft, much softer than anything I've ever used for exfoliating on my face. But while it's soft, it does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without stripping your skin raw. The outer surface feels almost silky, but when you put your fingers in and slightly stretch it to keep it on for use, the stretching opens up the cells in the surface and reveals a very effective, yet gentle, exfoliating mechanism.<br /><br />It's very easy to use, and very easy to clean - it comes with a silken loop to hang it for drying (it dries quickly.) All in all, I like this a lot. It's a nice change from daily Clarisonic use, one my skin truly appreciates. I'd definitely  put this on my 'must buy' list if you're serious about skincare.<br /><br />(I received a sample of this item to facilitate my honest and unbiased review.)",[],B0163GB1NE,B0163GB1NE,AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,1452253117000,1,False
4.0,"Excellent concealer; just beware that when they say 'light', they mean LIGHT!","I had a small bruise on my face from a cosmetic procedure, and it was driving me crazy that none of my concealers or foundations would cover it. Several friends had gotten the Boo-Boo concealer in a beauty box, and highly recommended it, so I grabbed it when I saw Amazon had it on sale.<br /><br />I'm very fair, so I got the light version. Ummm, I guess I'm not as fair as I thought; they aren't kidding when they say 'fair'! This is Caspar white!<br /><br />No matter. I mixed a bit of foundation in a more human shade in with the Boo-Boo, and my bruise was history (or at least until I washed my makeup off.) Very nice cover-up, no creasing, no caking, and it didn't move all day. The only issue I had, aside from how light the lightest shade was, is that it did such a good job of covering up the bruise it made the surrounding skin look naked (this is a VERY full coverage item.) Just be aware of that when you buy it.<br /><br />And take them at their word for the color! I'm probably somewhere between light and medium in the Boo-Boo universe. You can always add a drop or two of your foundation to make the color more your shade.",[],B00JV9TCSW,B07FX823ZQ,AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,1452040404000,15,True
5.0,"What contouring is and isn't, and why this is a great brush to use for it","In my younger days, I used to model, so I became an old hand at contouring, which seems to have been revived a la Kim Kardashian. One of my favorite brushes from then was a flat contouring brush that was angled. I absolutely adored it for adding the right shadow under my cheekbones to make them stand out.<br /><br />Since the contouring revival, I decided to give this a go again, but I couldn't find a reasonably priced brush that did what I wanted it to do (I refuse to spend a fortune on a brush for this, mostly because I do not see contouring lasting very long, but that's another review.) The HDSL brush came closest to what I was looking for: dense, flat and with a good handle.<br /><br />It kind of looks like a paint brush, but the hair is VERY nice. Very soft and dense, and a miracle for something that's less than six bucks. My contouring skills are such that I know not to buy an entire palette of colors that are way too orangey or warm. I use Kevyn Aucoin's contour powder which is way pricey (you can find something similar in color in Makeup Forever's eyeshadow line), but the Aucoin contour powder color was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />As I'm sure you know, contour is meant to mimic a shadow. It is NOT a bronzer (you cannot contour with anything with the slightest bit of shine); too orange and you look ridiculous. The color is a light matte taupe with zero hint of red in it. It should NOT be too dark, unless you are dark complected. Think of it as being two shades darker than your skin color, the way a shadow is cast on the hollows or low areas of your face.<br /><br />This brush picked up the powder like a champ and deposited it nicely. Does a great job fading the contour color out so it looks like a shadow and not like I have a swath of dirt on my face. My only hesitation with this so far is that I wish it was angled, but no matter. It's not that hard to use in such a way (well, what do you want for less than six bucks?)<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this. You won't get anything better at anywhere near the price.",[],B00WQEJV6M,B00WQEJV6M,AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,1442722144000,35,True

5.0,Pure retro red,"When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.<br /><br />Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.<br /><br />My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.<br /><br />The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)<br /><br />The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.<br /><br />This container isn't.<br /><br />So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.<br /><br />I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)<br /><br />The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.<br /><br />The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.<br /><br />I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.<br /><br />The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.<br /><br />The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.<br /><br />If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.<br /><br />N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)",[],B005AQC9U8,B005AQC9U8,AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,1380817768000,2,True

As a home owner in the Midwest with several BIG dogs and an avid gardener (but disabled now so my gardens... well.. don't get as much attention as I wish I could provide... ) and vehicles and siding to wash, I KNOW the value of a quality built garden hose nozzle / sprayer.  I LOVE the ease and convenience of this nozzle!  It fit right onto my heavy duty garden hose with standard fittings. The included washer is PERFECT, not a cheap hard plastic version, so NO LEAKS !!

Also, ceramides work better combined with certain types of ingredients that are contained in this serum, such as cholesterol, glycerin, squalane (rich in fatty acids) and more.<br /><br />This serum feels wonderful on my dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin that needs a lot of hydration and is aggravated easily by chemicals fragrance, natural fragrancing essential oils and extracts, drying alcohol, aggressive products, the environment and so on. I’ve been using this ceramide serum after cleansing and follow with my face cream, but it also layers well with my favorite staples, such as a Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum (followed by my moisturizer).<br /><br />I like that this ceramide serum doesn’t appear to have any harsh ingredients, and it feels soothing and gentle to my skin. I’ve used it about a week so far and it adds noticeable hydration that isn't heavy, greasy or sticky, and my normally sensitive skin is calm and comfortable.

3.0,Pleasant But Feels More Clarifying Than Hydrating To My Dry Skin-Has Risky Ingredient TEA,"I have dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin and used this Reboncel Aqua Rich Foaming Cleanser daily for about a week. This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br /><br />After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.",[],B09X23VTSQ,B09X23VTSQ,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1669914635772,1,False
3.0,"Moisturizes, Comforts, Some Color Correction-Emphasizes My Pores, Need An Ingredient List","JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm is a moisturizing balm for sensitive skin that soothes irritation and helps redness. It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don’t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars.

3.0,"Pretty Metallic Looks More Bronze Than Rose, Sticky Formula, Feels Drying, Best w/ Gloss Over It","This Beauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick in Rosé Posé comes in a cute tube and is a pretty metallic color lipstick that spreads on with a sponge type wand. The color reads darker on me than I’d expect from the photo, but it’s a lovely metallic shade that looks like a bronze with rose hue or a little rose gold in it. I have light skin with an olive hue and rosy color lips, and this color is flattering but is probably even better on medium and dark skin tones.<br /><br />But, while this lipstick initially spreads on smooth and velvety, it stays sticky and doesn’t fully dry down on me even with just one application. It doesn’t feel comfortable as I tend to get dry lips and it adds no moisture (and may be drying my lips more). Used alone, it accentuates lines and flakiness even used after a great lip scrub. And it doesn’t work applied over a little lip balm as it rolls off in weird little pieces. For me, it’s best with a little gloss over it, but it still feels sticky and rolls off (to a lesser extent) if I rub my lips together. Overall, it’s just okay at best. 3 stars.",[],B07C7S9WNP,B0BVQQ58G8,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1658671602427,0,False

My lips don’t get dried out or irritated, and the color doesn’t bleed even though I have dry skin. This is semi sheer yet buildable and even one swipe gives me good coverage that wears well. This does have sparkles that I need to remove after wear.<br /><br />This lipstick is really pretty. It looks sparkly and shimmery and has become a favorite for evening as it’s more glam than my subtle everyday pinks, yet it doesn’t look overdone or too intense. I wouldn’t normally choose an orange shade, but this turned out to be really flattering with my light skin with an olive hue. While “burnt orange” is a fair description of how it looks in the tube, on me this looks less orange and more like a reddish/nude color with a sparkly finish that’s coppery.

4.0,"Weightless, Skin Feels Silky, Makeup Lasts Longer, Blurs Lines-Odd Smell, Skin Gets Weird Sensation","This Grown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer has a gel texture that feels weightless on my skin. This doesn’t have a lot of ingredients and lacks chemical fragrance, but I find the scent is moderately strong. I assume it’s mostly from natural lavender, rose and grapefruit oils. I really don’t love the scent as it smells odd to me, but it mellows out and doesn’t really bother me. The lavender and grapefruit oils are potential irritants, but my sensitive skin hasn’t had any visible reaction or real discomfort using this primer.<br /><br />I have dry skin and when I apply the primer my skin feels a weird initial sensation that reminds me of alcohol, but so far it hasn’t caused any visible dryness. I do always apply a hydrating essence, serum and cream before the primer and I see the primer has glycerin, so that may be why I don’t see dryness or maybe something in this just feels mildly irritating to my skin. This does have benzyl alcohol pretty low on the list, so maybe I’m feeling that but the good part is that I haven’t had any real issue. I can’t say if daily use might dry my skin.<br /><br />This primer is super lightweight, so sheer it’s invisible and I don’t feel any sticky residue. It makes my skin feel silky, and my cream and liquid foundations spread smoothly and evenly over it. I do notice a blurring effect, especially around my mouth area where I need all the help I can get. My makeup holds up well all day even though the weather has been so really hot lately.

I can usually get the top pretty smooth but have some baby hairs and bad hair days where little hairs stick out and adding more of my regular lightweight gel or other products can weigh my hair down too much, make it look wet or dirty or make it clumpy or stiff. I don’t know why but I didn’t have high hopes that this Wing Fly Grl Mane Taming Wand gel would be anything special, but it really works great for my fine hair.<br /><br />It’s about the size of a mascara and has a wand with a small foam type applicator (similar to one on a lip gloss) at the end. I just gently run it over the hairs sticking up on top and they just lay down and blend right in with the rest of my hair.  I can’t say how this works for thick hair, but it sure is fast and easy to use and works great for me. My hair is very dark brown and I can’t see any sign of the gel, just the benefit of smooth hair.<br /><br />I haven’t experienced any flaking, dryness, stiffness, wet look, burning or discomfort or issues with my hair color. This wand is convenient as it’s so compact and easy to carry in my purse on-the-go. The ingredient list is short and no ingredients stand out as worrisome health risks or as being possibly damaging to my hair.

4.0,"Best For PM As A Little Heavy & Greasy, Boosts Moisture Well & Skin Feels Soft, Light Lavender Scent","Dose of Colors Cold Pressed Booster Multi-Use Oil agrees well with my dry, sensitive skin. I do find this Booster oil a little heavier than some other facial oil blends, but it doesn’t bother me as I tend to use facial oil blends of this type at night, and my skin is dry enough that I can use this during the day. I just have to be careful not to apply too much. When I add a little oil to my cream, I get extra moisture and the oil makes my skin feel soft and look dewy.<br /><br />This Booster has a high percentage of squalane (about 44%). It’s one of my favorite ingredients as it adds extra moisture to my dry skin and makes my skin smooth and soft. For daytime, I do have 100% squalane that I tend to prefer to this Booster oil just because it’s so lightweight yet gives me that extra moisture and softness. But I’d rather use like the the Booster oil blend at night as it has additional ingredients beyond squalane that add benefits, such as antioxidant and fatty acid rich sunflower seed oil.<br /><br />At night, I’ve tried this Booster oil various ways. I’ve applied it after cleansing and toning but would rather use a regular serum. I’ve mixed it with my night cream and have also applied after my cream. I feel there’s no right or wrong way, but I like it best added after my night cream as I can use all my regular products yet I also get an extra boost of antioxidants and moisture that can soak protect and nourish my skin all night. I like waking up to skin that still feels hydrated and comfortable.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this Booster oil emphasizes natural and gentle ingredients, and it also lacks chemical fragrance. I do smell a hint of lavender oil. It can be an irritant form some and can give me headaches if it’s too strong. Luckily, it’s subtle enough not to cause an issue. In fact, this Booster oil doesn’t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin at all. Like it a lot. 4.5 stars.

5.0,My “Go To” Cream That Soothes & Moisturizes My Skin When It’s Recovering From Irritation,"LAPOTHICELl Zincthenol Balm is a thick, white, creamy balm. It’s fragrance free, has no alcohol and is emollient enough to comfort my dry skin all night. It absorbs well as I have dry skin, but it is a little heavy only in that it feels like it leaves a protective barrier that’s slightly greasy yet feels good as it soothes and protects my skin. I don’t get a white cast from the zinc, but my skin is light. This balm feels like it keeps in moisture and softens my skin. It’s been a life saver when my skin has been irritated or is recovering from using a product that has burned or irritated my sensitive skin.<br /><br />While I’ve used the balm for less severe irritation too, I used this when my skin was recovering from a chemical reaction from an exfoliant that was too harsh for my sensitive skin and gave me a painful burn and visible inflammation. My dry skin needed something gentle to keep it moist all night and also calm and my usual products felt uncomfortable or just weren’t soothing enough. This balm was perfect as it also helped restore moisture, and it continues to be my “go to“ balm when my skin has a negative reaction or feels burned or irritated. Love it. 5 stars.

4.0,"Easy & Painless, Temporary Smoothing w/ Serum-Enjoy It But Can’t Gauge Long Term Benefit","﻿I’ve been using the NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple weeks and can’t yet gauge whether the laser is effective at increasing collagen production and smoothing wrinkles as a long term benefit. I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting 2 or 3 (depending on area). The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I’ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I’ll need to work up. I use the HA serum after use, and it’s a clear gel like serum that’s calming and my redness goes away quickly. I get a quick plumping effect that temporarily helps smooths lines, but I can’t say if Nira will provide a long term benefit over time. I do like using it with the serum, so I’m rating it 4 stars.

This is a thick, heavy, white cream with very subtle fragrance (last ingredient). This cream feels rich, but my dry skin doesn’t look greasy and my skin is dry enough that I’ve used this during the day. Still, it’s heavy and I prefer it as a night cream. It makes my skin feel calm, supple and so hydrated that it minimizes my fine lines.<br /><br />When I first applied this cream, it felt kind of like a barrier cream. While I love rich creams, I dislike creams that sit heavy on top of my skin as it feels annoying to me like my skin can’t breathe. But this Ogana Cell cream feels good as it turns out it absorbs well and feels like it only leaves just a light, protective layer that’s breathable on my skin. It’s probably just the feel of the occlusive dimethicone. This cream feels good and isn’t too heavy for me.<br /><br />This cream is perfect for times my face gets irritated or agitated as it feels extra gentle and calming. I also used a little of this cream on the back of my hands when they feel dry and get red as this cream is soothing and makes them feel better.

I go through lotion and cream fast as I use it every time I wash my hands and more, so I like this bigger size as it lasts longer but is still a compact size for my purse. It’s also big enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a lightweight mineral oil based lotion that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. It has a pleasant feel and adds just enough moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly comfortable. I do prefer more hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is moderately strong and sweet.

The FDA designates it as safe for limited use (but bans it from hand sanitizer), but EWG rates it as a moderate health risk (allergen).

The pads are large and soaked in a generous amount of solution. My pads look totally covered in makeup after gently wiping my face to remove my makeup, so I feel they do an excellent job. There’s no fragrance, but this has a nice light scent that hints of citrus.<br /><br />I squeeze out excess solution when I use the pads to remove my eye makeup (concealer, highlighter, shadow, etc.) and the pads do a great job with my eye makeup too. However, I don’t wear waterproof mascara and also don’t rub mascara off my eyes with any remover. My mascara largely comes off when I wash my face, and I’m wed to particular mascara remover that I use to wipe mascara residue after I’ve cleansed. But this works well too.<br /><br />There’s no need to rinse or cleanse after I wipe my face with these pads, and I have skipped cleansing at times. This makes my dry skin feel soft and hydrated and leaves just a hint of residue that I’d guess is glycerin (but I’m not sure). Other times, I basically double cleanse given how I remove my mascara and sometimes I just really want to make sure and remove all residue from my face (especially if I’ve worn more makeup) before applying other products like an essence, serums and creams.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this works so well and also has low risk ingredients. It lacks chemical fragrance, alcohol, silicones and parabens, and it has sodium hyaluronate to hydrate and plump the skin and other dry skin ingredients, such as glycerin, matricaria flower/stem extract and butylene glycol.

I’m not one for a complicated makeup routine and also don’t like experimenting a lot with my makeup, so love that this compact includes my contour bronzer, blush and highlighter and step-by-step application instructions for applying and blending all three colors. It’s rare that I can use all colors in a palette, so I’m really pleased that all three colors work beautifully together and actually flatter my skin tone. The highlighter and even the blush can be used as eye makeup too.<br /><br />I have light skin with an olive hue. I knew the bronzer and highlighter colors would work as I wear similar shades from my regular bronzer palette, but I wasn’t sure about wearing a peachy blush color as I’ve always worn red and pink shades. But I’m so glad I tried this palettes I realize I should have shifted to wearing a peachy shade ages ago as it goes with my skin tone well. This peach doesn’t have too much orange and is rather neutral, but it gives my skin a natural flush that’s pretty. These colors are buildable, so I start light (especially with the bronzer).<br /><br />These are well pigmented and apply evenly with no streaking. I have dry skin but get a smooth, velvety application. The colors are long lasting as I wore them all day yesterday, and my makeup still looked good at the end of the day. These powders don’t settle in my fine lines, and it’s quick and easy to apply and blend the colors with just one brush. The palette is made in China, but the box says this is certified cruelty free. I’m really happy with this palette, and the quality exceeds my expectations at the current $28 price. Love it. 5 stars.",[],B083M985Q5,B083M985Q5,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1618303907730,0,False
5.0,"Real Benefits-Fades Dark Spots, Helps Even Skin Tone, Softer & Firmer Skin, Lasting Hydration","This Beauty Stat Universal Essentials kit includes generous mini sizes of the Universal C Skin Refiner Serum with 20% L-Ascorbic Acid, Universal Moisture Essence (100% Squalane from sugar) and Universal Moisture Boost Cream. These fragrance free products are exceptional for my hyperpigmentation and skin tone issues, dry skin and skin texture. These don’t irritate my dry and sensitive skin and seem well suited to any skin types.<br /><br />I’ve used 20% L-Ascorbic acid for many years and worked up from 5% to 20% over time as it can sting, itch or irritate the skin to go straight to a high 20% concentration. I’ve been using this Universal C Serum since last year (before this sample kit) and had no stinging this time and had only temporary, slight stinging when I first tried the C serum last year as I wasn’t using my Vitamin C serum as routinely for a short period.<br /><br />With regular use at least 1x a day, the Universal C Serum brightens my skin and evens my skin tone. While it didn’t go away 100%, this serum flattened and faded a large brown spot on my jawline so much it became barely visible. It also faded smaller brown spots on my cheeks. The serum makes my skin smoother and it seems a bit firmer. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant for long term anti aging benefits too.<br /><br />I apply the Universal C Serum after cleansing and toning and follow with the Essence (Squalene drops) and Moisture Boost. The Moisture Boost feels lightweight and nongreasy, but it’s super moisturizing when I mix in a couple Squalane drops. The texture of my dry skin feels so silky and smooth, and my skin feels comfortable and amply hydrated all day. These products provide real benefits for me. Love this set. 5 stars.",[],B08S1LWF9V,B08S1LWF9V,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1617296075291,0,False
4.0,"Feels Lightweight For My Dry Skin, Better For Evening As Strong Lavender Scent & Retinyl Palmitate","This Kneipp lavender lotion is thick, but it’s not a heavy or greasy lotion. This probably provides moderate hydration for normal skin, but for me it feels quite lightweight. I think it’s a nice cream, but I prefer a richer lotion or cream that comforts my dry skin more and provides longer lasting hydration. When I’ve applied this after an evening shower, my skin feels reasonably moisturized for a few hours but it’s not enough moisture to last all night so I need to reapply before bed. This seems best for those who don’t need heavy hydration and enjoy a lavender scent.<br /><br />This lotion does have a moderately strong lavender scent that even lingers on my hands after washing. It smells nice and doesn’t bother me, but it may bother those sensitive to fragrance as this is just in the range of what I can tolerate as strong lavender has been a headache trigger for me. This lotion has retinyl palmitate, which is especially risky mixed with sun exposure. This lotion seems best for evening use given that lavender can be relaxing and retinyl palmitate doesn’t mix well with sun. Like it. 4 stars.",[],B01MSF13T1,B01MSF13T1,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1617128292905,0,False
3.0,"Minty & Cooling, Heavy & Doesn’t Absorb Well, Agitates My Sensitive Skin-Some Good Ingredients","﻿I’m in my 50’s and have dry, sensitive skin and also have some contact allergies. This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream is pale green and has a nice, light spearmint scent that may be from mint oils, such as Mentha Viridis Leaf Oil and Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, as chemical fragrance isn’t listed. This cream has an unusual balmy texture that feels slippery and silky. It oddly feels like it just sits on top of my dry skin rather being absorbed. It’s not greasy, but it feels heavy like a barrier cream. I’m not crazy about that feel. I do like that it’s thick and has somewhat of a firming feel.<br /><br />I’d be okay with the texture at night (not for daytime), but this cream imparts a strong cooling sensation (possibly from mint oil as this is alcohol free) that doesn’t feel pleasing to me. Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I’ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn’t in the short time I’ve left it on). It feels better rubbed on my arm, so maybe it’s good for other skin types.<br /><br />I can’t gauge how well this hydrates as I had to discontinue use. It has some good stuff like apple fruit extract (scavenges free radicals) and algae (antioxidant and hydration). It also has moisturizing and/or soothing ingredients, such as glycerin, vitamin E, butylene glycol, macadamia nut oil and shea butter. However, it also has known sensitizers, such as spearmint and mint oils, that get “poor” ratings by Paula’s Choice. This generally seems like a quality cream, but it feels heavy and irritating to my sensitive skin. 3.5 stars.",[],B08SQZ1B3W,B08SQZ1B3W,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1613774659440,3,False
3.0,"Good Dry Skin Ingredients, But I Don’t Get The Obvious Plumping Benefits I Get w/ Patchology Gels","I have dry, sensitive skin and love using eye gel patches as they can feel so soothing and refreshing, and some immediately plump and smooth my fine lines around my eyes. My favorite gels are by Patchology as I get amazing results. The GenSkin marine algae gels seem good quality and they do make my skin feel soft, but I don’t see the obvious plumping benefits I get with the Patchology gels and these gels also don’t feel as comforting or refreshing. I’ve even compared by wearing one of each brand at the same time, and my skin with the Patchology gel gets superior results as my lines barely show.<br /><br />These GenSkin gels are deep blue and have added colorant (which is typical). They also have fragrance, but it doesn’t smell overly strong. The GenSkin patches stay on well and have some good dry skin ingredients, such as sodium hyaluronate, glycerin, beta glucan, matricaria flower extract and butylene glycol. Most ingredients rate low risk by EWG (other than fragrance, colorant and preservative). These seem good, but I just don’t get the comfort or obvious plumping and hydration I get with Patchology gels. So these are just okay for me. 3 stars.

5.0,Feels Enjoyable & My Skin Feels Extra Soft & Smooth-Can’t Say If It Actually Improves Skin Tone,"﻿The Dermaclara Claritone Intensify serum micropulsation device has a slim, elegant design with a flat metal head applicator. The pulsation is gentle rather than an abrupt or annoying vibration, and I enjoy the way it feels when applying my face serum. I actually feel a slight warming sensation that I assume is due to increased blood circulation, and I have more color in my face after using this device. It’s a healthy color rather than an irritation, and I like it as my skin is pale and can look drab.<br /><br />My skin feels extra smooth and soft after using this serum micropulsation device. It seems like it aids absorption of my serums, but I can’t say for sure and it may be that I end up using more serum than usual. I typically use only a pump or two when applied with my fingers, but I probably use twice that in conjunction with this device. I really don’t know if this device can actually improve my skin tone or fine lines, but I love how my skin feels and it’s relaxing to use. It runs on a regular watch battery (included).

5.0,Lovely Gentle Wash That Doesn’t Irritate Or Dry My Skin-No Sulfates & Has All Low Risk Ingredients,"As someone with dry and sensitive skin, I adore this Hylunia Hydrate body ﻿wash. It feels so gentle and comfortable on my skin. This wash leaves my skin calm and isn’t drying at all. Even without sulfates, it produces ample lather when used on a pouf or mitt. This wash feels refreshing and has a subtle and fresh mango scent that’s natural from mango fruit extract rather than from chemical fragrance.<br /><br />The ingredients are outstanding in that all rate low risk by EWG (all get a 1 rating except citric acid gets a 2). This wash highlights for me how a product doesn’t have to contain risky or irritating chemicals to be enjoyable and perform well. I love everything about this wash and highly recommend it anyone, especially those with dry and/or sensitive skin. Vegan.

I’m pleased that Follain feels gentle, and I can use it without any issues. It’s a plain looking white bar that lathers well and feels pleasing as a daily body soap in the shower. This Follain soap cleanses well, and it’s generous lather is perfect to use on my legs and under my arms for shaving.<br /><br />This soap hasn’t made my skin dry, itchy or irritated. I follow my shower with my usual moisturizer, and my skin feels calm and comfortable. This soap bar seems long lasting, maybe because it doesn’t get mushy or disintegrate. I enjoy the scent as it’s fresh, light and I think it’s smells more like citrus than lavender. It’s a neutral scent that seems good for anyone. This soap is pleasing and gentle enough for dry, sensitive skin. Love it. 5 stars. Made in the USA.",[],B086N136NH,B086N136NH,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1605547938842,0,False
5.0,"Big Hydration Boost & Smooth Skin w/o Silicones & Junk, Super Gentle, Light Scent From Oil Blend","﻿Laloirelle Deep Hydration Face Oil definitely gives my dry, sensitive skin a noticeable hydration boost and makes it feel more supple and comfortable. I apply 3 drops to my skin after cleansing and follow with my face cream after giving the oil a little time to absorb. This oil feels rich, but it doesn’t have a heavy or greasy feeling on my skin. It makes my skin feel great whether I apply my face cream after waiting for the oil to absorb fully or I apply it while there’s still a light residue on my face.<br /><br />I can use Laloirelle during the day without issues applying makeup after, but others may have a different experience as I have dry skin. But I do prefer it at night with a face cream after as it’s so effective and long lasting that my skin still feels well moisturized and smooth when I wake the next morning. The oily residue is gone by then, but I think my fine lines look softer and my skin looks more radiant. I feel like my skin gets a boost or head start for the day, and that it’s not just a temporary effect from silicones and chemicals found in so many products.<br /><br />This contains a sandalwood and jasmine oil blend that’s so light I don’t even smell it when I apply the product to my face. This oil feels super gentle and nonirritating to my sensitive skin. This has dry skin ingredients (e.g., avocado oil, evening primrose oil & Vitamin E) and anti aging ingredients (e.g., ginseng root, shiitake mushroom, etc.) This oil uses 98% organic ingredients, and all ingredients rate low risk to health per Skincarisma (using EWG standards).

5.0,"Gentle On Sensitive Skin, Good Hydration But Not 24 Hours, Natural/Organic Emphasis (4.5 Stars)","La La Leaf Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels cooling and calming to my dry, sensitive skin. It feels light, absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin fairly well. This lotion leaves my hands and skin soft, silky and comfortable. I don’t feel my dry skin gets as much hydration as I get with my favorite premium body butters and creams, but those are heavier products so I don’t expect as much from a lotion.<br /><br />When applied after my shower, I get about 8 hours of hydration. That’s pretty good, though not the 24 hours claimed on the site. I do have dry skin and find this lotion hydrates better than most lotions. I’ve occasionally found one that gives me longer lasting hydration, but it’s uncommon. Excipial keeps my dry skin comfortable and itch free more like 12 hours but has chemicals such as parabens, while Guayaquil Hemp Lotion emphasizes organic and natural ingredients (but does have Phenoxyethanol).<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels gentle and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It doesn’t list chemical fragrance and is labeled fragrance free, which is a big plus as some fragrances trigger sensitivities for me. But it still may have fragrance. I smell a faint non offensive scent and don’t know if it’s from added “essential oil” (last ingredient) or just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has 250 mg of CBD (THC free), which is still being studied but “may” hydrate dry skin and help inflammation. The ingredients look good but this lotion does have moderately risky (per EWG) Phenoxyethanol in the top ten ingredients and drying alcohol in the bottom 5. I like this lotion a lot as it feels pleasing to my sensitive skin, hydrates my dry skin pretty well, is 84% organic and barely has a scent. 4.5 stars. Made in USA.

5.0,The Best Aluminum Free Deodorant-Prefer Native Unscented But Their Scented Works Great Too,"I’ve been using Native unscented deodorant for a couple years, and it’s my favorite aluminum free deodorant. I’ve been trying a 3-pack of full size scented Native deodorant sticks in Peony & Jasmine Tea, Sweet Almond & Honey and Linen & Cotton varieties. The Peony is a citrusy floral scent, and the Linen one smells crisp and fresh. The Sweet Almond smells a little sweet like honey and has a light coconut scent. I especially like the Peony and Linen scents as they work best with my chemistry, but all three smell nice and none of the fragrance is too heavy. All three came with protective shields under the caps.<br /><br />The unscented is still my favorite, but the scented varieties also work well for me and do seem to neutralize bacteria so my armpits don’t get stinky. While not an antiperspirant, I haven’t noticed my armpits getting wet even when the weather gets hotter. These scented deodorants have tapioca starch and sodium bicarbonate (just like the unscented) that I assume helps my pits stay feeling dry. My armpits don’t turn a weird color or feel irritated, and I haven’t noticed any white flakes on my clothes or any staining. The fragranced assortment smells good and is really effective for me. Definitely recommend. 5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YDn+HHm1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YDn+HHm1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YDn+HHm1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NogRgv-lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NogRgv-lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NogRgv-lL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0848VJ18X,B0848VJ18X,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1583996399021,0,False

I’ve been using this coconut based hand soap daily and find it pleasant. It glides and lathers well when I rub my hands together and stays on my hands long enough to be thorough washing. This soap isn’t overly drying, though I almost always need lotion after hand washing. The lavender scent from essential oils is light, which is a plus as I’m not a fan of heavy scent. The container holds 12 oz. and the company sells 16 oz. refills (currently $6.95) in a paper based container styled like a milk carton to reduce plastic waste.<br /><br />The glass container has a modern design that looks nice countertop. It has a beige or taupe color silicone (or similar) material on the bottom and lower sides that prevents slipping and adds breakage protection. The plastic pump is also beige and good quality but may not last as long as the glass container. Beige isn’t my favorite color but it’s neutral and the company offers a blue shade that looks pretty in the photo. This soap has coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride and a natural essential oil blend (not in that order). I assume “potassium soap” is potassium hydroxide (caustic lye), but believe it’s found in all liquid soap under various names.

5.0,"While Subjective, I Do Think My Skin Looks Better Using Glo Pro Regularly W/ Good Products","While I think evaluating the results is subjective, I enjoy micro needling with my Glo Pro a lot and do believe it makes my skin look better. I used Glo Pro regularly for about 2-1/2 months, 2-3 times a week. I’m 57 and felt my skin did look particularly good with regular use. While results weren’t dramatic in that my wrinkles didn’t magically disappear, I feel the overall appearance of my skin seemed brighter, firmer and some lines seemed less noticeable. Around my eyes and cheeks aren’t big problem areas (except dark circles), but my fine lines looked virtually nonexistent in those areas and I feel I looked more refreshed and my skin looked more taut. The frown lines by my mouth are my worst issue and those didn’t improve as much as I hoped, but I did think the lines seemed less noticeable and the area seemed less saggy or firmer to me.<br /><br />I decided to take a break of about a month to see if I stopped if I’d notice a difference.  I don’t think my skin looks as good as it did when using Glo Pro regularly. I feel I look less refreshed, my frown lines look worse and my skin seems kind of dull. I can’t speak to the science of whether micro needing really increases collagen production (or if it can damage the skin), or if my benefit is because it increases absorption of my arsenal of serums and creams. But I do think I looked better from use and my skin doesn’t look as good since I stopped. It’s a tool that I’ve gone back to using, and I do really like using a lot.  I apply quality serums and creams within 60 seconds of using Glo Pro and do think I get bigger benefits from my products. I personally avoid using AHA and retinol products after Glo Pro as they’re too irritating for my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I don’t find Glo Pro painful to use. The needles feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused me any excessive redness, irritation or bleeding. I’ve seen videos of bleeding caused by micro needling done by professionals and read that going that deep isn’t required for micro needling to work. I only use Glo Pro at night and never wake with any redness or irritation. I do use the Glo Pro Pads after I cleanse to sanitize in order to avoid bacteria spread as I got a few blemishes after I ran out but don’t get blemishes using the pads (and alcohol is much too harsh for my dry skin).  I always keep the included spritz bottle filled with alcohol and spray the head after every use. While subjective, I do feel my skin looks better from using Glo Pro regularly with good treatment products and rate it 5 stars.",[],B07CCZH87X,B07CCZH87X,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1546801048210,12,False
5.0,Eye Replacement Head Fits Glo Pro Perfectly & Makes It Easier To Use Glo Pro In Eye Area,"I’m using the Glo Pro eye attachment head with my Glo Pro that I bought from a department store that included only the face attachment head. The eye head is slimmer and less than half the width with just four rows of needles. The eye head is an authentic and high quality attachment that snaps on easily and fits Glo Pro perfectly. I definitely prefer using this slimmer eye head for the delicate area around my eyes and between my brows and even my forehead (which is small). The smaller head gives me better control and greater ease of using Glo Pro in small areas.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure of the boundaries around my eye area, so I emailed Glo Pro and was informed the eye head can be used right up to the bottom lashes (but not on the eye lids).  Still, this device is new to me so for now I don’t go much beyond the orbital bone- where I apply my night time eye cream.  The Glo Pro needles are short and feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused any excessive redness or irritation. I definitely recommend the smaller eye attachment head for Glo Pro users and rate it 5 stars.<br /><br />I wasn’t provided a Glo Pro device and this review is only of the eye attachment head.  Still, I’m sure people wonder if Glo Pro works. I’ve used a Glo Pro about a month, twice a week, and don’t feel I’ve used it long enough to know.  I’m in my 50’s and my skin does happen to look good lately.  I don’t see dramatic changes, but my skin seems firmer and my fine lines around my eyes and elsewhere seem less noticeable. But I feel I need to use Glo Pro longer to decide if it’s the device, my skin care products or both that are providing a benefit. I do like Glo Pro enough to keep using it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zuuKORMLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zuuKORMLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zuuKORMLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B06XD3SXQ8,B09J5TZ7HL,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,1539878247619,16,False

The oil is initially applied with dry hands on your dry face, but you add water to your skin and that emulsifies the oil and makes it look and feel pretty much like soap. This cleanser leaves no residual oil on my face at all.  In fact, it actually leaves my face a little dry as compared to my usual cleanser.  Also, while it removes most of my mascara, I still need to use my Lancôme eye makeup remover to get rid of the last traces of non-waterproof mascara under my eyes.<br /><br />This cleansing oil comes in a nice bottle with a pump that works well. It doesn't cause me any rash or irritation. This does have fragrance, but even though I can get headaches or allergic reactions to fragrance this one doesn't bother me. I think this is a nice cleansing oil that will work well for most skin types- except I wouldn't really recommend it if you have dry skin like me.

3.0,"OK, but outperformed by a $10 foil electric","I got this shaver in early January of 2007.  For the first month or so that I had it, it worked decently.  The shave was relatively close and it did get most of the hair, but it did take a few passes over the skin, and a touch-up using the on-board trimmer to get the ones it missed.  I also found myself having the stretch the skin quite a bit to get a close enough shave.  However, it did offer an irritation-free shave (I have sensitive skin, thus why I stay away from blade razors).<br /><br />Over the next few months, though, I noticed that the shave started to get more irritating: more 'pulling' instead of cutting (had always pulled a little, but got more frequent), takes more passes to cut what it once would, etc.  I changed the blades after 3 months (short period, yes, but I tried anyway).  It helped a little, but it still wasn't as good as it once was.  Then, I started to realize that the shaver wasn't holding as strong a charge as it once did.  It would come off the charger and be 'full power' for less than one shave, and would need to go back on the charger after 6 shaves (far less than the advertised two weeks).  A call to Norelco led nowhere, as they said it was 'expected' for the battery to wear down over time (4 months?).<br /><br />I kept using the razor as I wasn't about to waste the $90 investment.  On a trip in late July, I had forgotten to pack the shaver, so I purchased a $10 Remington battery-operated foil razor at a local convenience store.  Sad to say, but from Day 1 that foil razor has outperformed the Norelco by leaps and bounds in all areas (closer shave, gets all areas better, less passes needed, etc.).  Also on a sad note, the Remington is kicking the bucket (a year later), and I am forced to go back to the Norelco for the time being while I look for an acceptable foil shaver as a replacement.<br /><br />In short, this razor performed decently at first, but it seems as though compared to a $10 battery operated razor, this $70 shaver isn't a good value for the investment.",[],B0009MFUOA,B0009MFUOA,AERG2TRTS4IWR6IBVODWM26W2LYQ,1214938909000,2,False

This was promising, but unfortunately did not do the trick.  My symptom is a constant runny watery eye. If my eye is not covered, it just seems to run tears non-stop. Up until I tried this, I have just been wearing a black eye patch from the drug store, which is kind of lose, but stops the eye from watering. I am not even sure how the black eye patch is stopping the eye from watering, as I am not sure if the eye is watering from light sensitivity or air hitting it or all of the above. Since a black eye patch works, I figure this clear moisture chamber would be better.<br /><br />First, this is just a cut piece of plastic in the general shape of an eye, with some elastic punched through each end and some foam. Trying to adjust the really cheap elastic is tough, you have to try to tie it in a knot and I just ended up with it either too tight or too loose.

1.0,Truly devious packaging,"I bought this from Target because I'd had a fairly good experience with their deodorant. The shampoo itself is OK, but the bottle it's packaged in is designed to keep you from actually getting what you paid for. I'll explain.<br /><br />The curved shape of the bottle itself probably makes it very efficient to pack/ship, but it also makes it difficult to squeeze, especially in combination with the thick, rigid plastic they use. And because the ""nozzle"" (or whatever it's called) is offset rather than centered, you cannot balance it upside-down to make it easier to get the remaining shampoo out as the bottle gets low. The combination of these three factors (rigid plastic, thin curved shape, and offset ""nozzle"") means that at a certain point, you're going to have shampoo left in the bottle that you can't actually get out, unless you want to rig some kind of device to balance the bottle upside-down.<br /><br />This may seem like a minor complaint, but with basically ANY other brand of shampoo (or body wash, EMJ does this with those as well), you don't have to deal with this. It's wasteful, and it feels like it was probably designed that way on purpose, to get consumers to buy the next bottle faster. Given that the shampoo and body wash (which I also tried) isn't anything particularly special, I can't recommend anyone bother with this. You can get equal quality and ""clean ingredient"" shampoos from so many other companies with bottles that aren't designed like this.",[],B08CK3QKN9,B08CK3QKN9,AF52NWJSJ2X6UALLBYMR4YSBR74A,1603900390350,0,False

I've only had two applications and so far my skin is much softer and smoother. My husband keeps stroking my face like he did when we were first dating, it's an unexpected, but welcome benefit. I can't wait to see how my skin will look by the time I've completed the container. It will take awhile, as a little goes a long way (see photo taken of jar, this is after two applications for my entire face and neck have been used and it still looks full). I think I may try it on the backs of my hands to see if it is just as effective. Four stars is only for the potent smell, which some people actually like, but I am not thrilled about.

Using this beforehand, my hair felt soft, bouncy, and lustrous. At the appointment, the stylist talked me into getting some Paul Mitchell Color Protect shampoo and conditioner which was a total waste of money in my opinion and I have since abandoned it for this again. My hair isn't quite as nice as it was before all the processing I did, but I expected that. This shampoo however has outperformed the Paul Mitchell stuff by far in terms of protecting my color from wash-out/fade-out, making my hair feel touchably soft, and not weighing it down. My hair does start to look a little more oily on day 2 than it did before using this, but it's a minor difference, and nothing a little dry shampoo can't fix.",[],B012Q9NGE4,B012Q9NGE4,AHBL75X4YCHUHPGCUKXS3QRSXPTA,1461351769000,0,True

When I found these I liked the fact that it comes in a pair rather than just one glove like most other ones for sale.

4.0,Pretty nice quality hair for the price.,"I've been using extensions since 2006, due to health issues causing extreme hair thinning.  I used to get the fused extensions at the salon, 1500 dollars back in the day. They broke off from the weight of the extensions because my hair was so fine and thin. The fused glob of hair was just too much and so many fell out. I started buying the clip in hair, taking the clips off and using them as weft hair. I use salon pro white glue, much like eyelash glue but used for weft hair.  It is a wonderful solution and I still alternate between tape in hair and the clip in wefts. I also buy closures and custom color, to make my own toppers. What a job! But, I'm happy with the results. I have more control over the color and style, and I feel 'normal'.<br /><br />This hair is a medium to coarse texture, thick, and has a really nice body wave. The  is soft and smooth and doesn't feel damaged.  It will blend with fine hair. You can use a straightening iron, just be sure that you can control the temperature. Once you burn this hair, it will stink and it will be ruined. However, if you control the temperature and use care, the hair looks great straight and shiny. You can also curl the hair. I have used felted hot rollers, and those work really well. They are safer, and not as damaging, and the curls last so long.<br /><br />These 16"" extensions are very nice. Although the ad isn't quite accurate. The color is a darker caramel blond, and a reddish brown. This is not piano keys, but close. The wefts are not in the ombre style, they are bold and varied high lights. If you look at the ad images, the photos showing the people aren't shown with this product in their hair. The wefts laying on a surface showing the color differences between the offered colors is the most accurate.  I've offered some images that show the color more accurately.  You can custom color most of the wefted hair, but adding color is easier. Typically the hair has so much red in it that it is impossible to cover or remove, and the dye can be hard to remove. You can add a longer root to eliminate the chunky roots.  My hair is so fine, the sewn edge can be obvious, so have a good match to my natural blonde ash tone roots helps. Any coloring will add to the damage and potentially shorten the life of the hair, but for me it makes me happier to have an exact match to what I want, and I am hard to match for color.<br /><br />The weight of the hair is shown in a photo in ounces. In grams, we get a little over 104 grams, far less than the advertised 120grams, and I would complain about this and have, just not for this brand.  That being said, the fullness and the weight is still good, and the wefts seem to feel average when compared to what I usually order. If you order the longer options, the hair will be thinner, as most hair is sold by weight. 120 would be better, of course. This weight is significantly lower than 120grams.<br /><br />Shedding.  Over the last 7 years or so, shedding has become a real problem. It never used to be this bad. There is a weft glue that is meant to slow or prevent shedding and I always use it. It makes the weft more stiff, but if you use the weft the way I use them, you need to do something to protect your weft hair.  You can find it online. If you are using this hair for special occasions and clipping  to thick strong hair and are simply making your hair more full, wild and glamorous, then you may not need to worry about shedding. I did finger comb this hair once out of the packaging, and there was significant shedding. Again, I say, this is a common issue now, and unique to this particular brand. I have no idea what changed but the wefts should not shed this much, but they all do this with most brands.  I have to say that if the wefts didn't shed so much, they would last for a couple of years or longer.  Also, keep in mind I use the wefts differently, so clipping, as intended, may offer longer life and far less shedding.<br /><br />The length is 16"" and the hair hangs nicely, with a gentle, natural taper.  There is a very nice body wave. It's not a blunt edge finish, which is nice.<br /><br />The clips are the same type that I see on most clip in kits. They are small, and hold nicely even on fine hair.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great value and will require the extra effort to keep them looking great over a year or more.  To keep human hair looking good and tangle free, I use the sleep and shine shampoo and conditioner. It keeps the hair fresher and mat free longer.  There are a lot  of youtube videos that can help you with application and care, and give you tips and tricks.<br /><br />4 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EEyjKTZTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EEyjKTZTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EEyjKTZTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yiBWglRtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yiBWglRtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yiBWglRtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C2f0eFc0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C2f0eFc0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C2f0eFc0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91U15Dmq3ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91U15Dmq3ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91U15Dmq3ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UnKbeqdWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UnKbeqdWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UnKbeqdWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91W3L3Sn0WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91W3L3Sn0WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91W3L3Sn0WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iJSmiPS+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iJSmiPS+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iJSmiPS+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08R6QX4Y9,B08R6QX4Y9,AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ,1618218516591,1,False

5.0,This is a great product line.,"This product is exactly as advertised and shown in the images. This mini system does not come with color, so be prepared.  The packaging is attractive, and the products came very well packaged and arrived safely in perfect condition.  This gel nail polish kit has  a little different texture than some of the kits available these days. This system has a complete nail prep and foundation product line-up much like the really great gel nails from 20 years ago. I'm hoping the long term quality of the nail growth and health with this product line,  is as good as the old products as well. As well all know, products can help your nails or destroy them, and this product line, the formulas remind me of the better products that were once available and were very expensive to buy.<br /><br />The thing people may not be used to is the last step of using the finishing wipe to remove the sticky layer once the manicure is complete. Some top coats are completely set and free of any tackiness right after the curing process. These products cure quickly with some heat, and 60 seconds seemed to be plenty of time. After the top coat and final removal of the tackiness, the nails are perfect. This kit doesn't come with color, so I experimented with a milky white and some blue ink, using the wood tools included in the kit to move and swirl the pigment around. It's a fun, creative way to change  up polish. I think stencils could be fun, and I do have mica powders, some bling pieces, to play with as well. I like these products, and the box came with a nice catalogue of other products available.<br /><br />This product is easy to use, I've experienced no irritation of my cuticles or nail bed, no itching or discomfort at all. The light is really cute, tiny and it works. Just one easy button and it turns off automatically in a minute. I pressed twice to get 2 minutes but found that 1 minute was enough, which is great. The result of this product is thin, but strong, offering flexibility of the nail as well, and no cracking. I'll update with wear and removal.  Very reasonable and competitive value.  5 stars.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JWTVDo8LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JWTVDo8LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JWTVDo8LL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ne37cO-XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ne37cO-XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ne37cO-XL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B078XKTZHV,B0BC273JJR,AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ,1596274050964,4,False

5.0,Excellent tape in hair extensions,"These are 20"" extensions, and I usually order 14"" or 16"". 20"" is on the long side and I will be trimming the length for my taste and toning the hair as well. When I order next I'll be ordering the shorter hair.  The weight of the hair for 20 pieces, is 50grams, so for each longer strand you have a finer tape in weft. With the shorter lengths you get a little more fullness in other words but typically the good brands still make sure they are clear about the weight of the hair you get in grams. My hair is so fine that one bundle of 20 nearly is enough, but I buy 2 sets and end up using 4 rows of about 6 extensions each then complete the look with a topper because my crown is so thin the extensions and scalp shows. I'll be toning these extensions but this is how they look as they came, with no color correction. B 8-18-60. Which is usually the color I order, but this is better. This color matches my hair better than the brand I have been using.<br /><br />I do a single weft application using a single sided tape to finish the back side of the weft and seal the tape. You must seal the backside of the tape or the weft will fall out, or make a mess of your hair. Many people need 4 or more sets to do a full head of hair. Some people with thicker and stronger hair will use two full wefts back to back and will not need the single sided tape. There are you tube videos about DIY application of tape in extensions. There are many steps and I'm skipping most of it. It's not that hard and you'll enjoy the convenience and savings by doing this yourself. Your biggest challenge is finding good hair and good tapes. This time used Glam single sided tapes and that worked great. expensive but good and you get 36 in the package. I use walker double sided tapes, they come in packages of 120 and have worked for me but they are stiff. This brand has tapes, and I'll be checking out their tapes soon.  I will have to update to let you know how they last and how easy or difficult they are to remove. Typically my tape in hair lasts about 6 weeks and then due to growth there is a need to take them out and put them back in again, moving them up closer to the scalp. 6 to 8 weeks is typically when you go to the salon to get cut and root touch ups too. This isn't really about hold or the extensions coming out, although some may come out. This is about limiting damage to the hair and just keeping the connection point closer to the scalp. They feel good, the hair quality seems great. There is far less red in this hair than typical of the dark blonds or ash blond roots.  This color combination is good. The description says silky straight but I prefer some body wave, and as you can see when you wet this hair there is a little natural wave that comes out. That's perfect. I've offered plenty of photos. The kit that the hair came with is nice too. Some double sided tapes to refresh your weft after you clean them in 6 weeks or so.  To remove the wefts I typically just stick my finger nail between the two layers of tape and put a drop or two with a dropper of alcohol 91 percent will work but 99 is better. This usually works to safely loosen the glue bond and remove the hair. I tried the oil based removers and it just complicates things. The best removers are mostly alcohol. I'll update this review in 6 to 8 weeks. For now, I'd recommend these extension for the hair and weft quality and accuracy of color and weight.  Good value. 5 starts. I hope they keep this up.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Xw4beGKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Xw4beGKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Xw4beGKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Di2vFB7BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Di2vFB7BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Di2vFB7BL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L+CoBE0kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L+CoBE0kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L+CoBE0kL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4jx3q8SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4jx3q8SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P4jx3q8SL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WQh3HwKCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WQh3HwKCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WQh3HwKCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZD6WmzffL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZD6WmzffL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZD6WmzffL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GIzQZmrVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GIzQZmrVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GIzQZmrVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-Ec1nLzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-Ec1nLzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q-Ec1nLzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ux8mf0QbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ux8mf0QbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ux8mf0QbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07SR1CBQ7,B07SR1CBQ7,AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ,1581124805880,1,False
3.0,Not too convinced about claims after use for a few days.,"Usually a serum is immediately effective at deep hydration, fine line and dryness management even if temporary. Usually the under eye area darkness, under eye wrinkles, puffiness, and crows feet are treated and diminished within minutes of first application and improves the look of make up in those areas as well. Perhaps over time the texture of the skin improves with continued use but can backslide if product use is discontinued.<br /><br /> I have not seen much improvement, immediate or over the few days with use twice daily while using this product, unfortunately. Also, I'm not sure when we are supposed to use this product. Perhaps over night? The reason why I mention this is that the product doesn't absorb into the skin cleanly, but rather is tacky to the touch and feels heavy. I didn't notice any fragrance, but I make candles and am probably nose blind at the moment. The product feels like a watery jelly, because it is mostly water and aloe gel.  It does have gold flecks in it and they seem to break up and disappear when on the skin, massaged. I haven't seen any help for fine lines or skin texture. This is a photo taken right now. Un-retouched The left side of the photo is the 24k serum side, after three days and after recent application. The right side is immediate results of another product I use applied within a half hour of the photo. It works so fast, even I couldn't believe the photo. The lines on the other side are pretty bad actually, which means I've back slid over the last few days and have more trouble. I've been using the 24K serum on half of my face, the right side of my face only. As to the right side of the photo and left side of my face, I'm not pulling on it or doing anything to make the skin look better, less wrinkled or tighter, I just put the serum on and wrote for a bit and then took the photo to complete this review. The right side serum is from a farmer's market made by a local person, Julia's. This roll on was only 15 dollars and I've been using it for under eye area on days when I wear makeup,  for a few months.  I felt I should offer a photo, although not a great photo and it's not flattering at all. I'll continue to try it, but at my age I need all the help I can get and don't want to backslide.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aAHcoBisL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aAHcoBisL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61aAHcoBisL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07LGWMPL6,B07LGWMPL6,AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ,1574645522368,0,False
4.0,"Smells great, light lemony fragrance, silky texture.","The fragrance is nice and light, subtle like a soft lemon dessert. The bottle seems oversized for the amount of product inside, and as I popped the top up the bottom slipped up and the cap fell off the inner bottle. Photo is provided so you can see what I mean, it's not a deal breaker but for the vanity it will bother people. It's a glamorous container and product, so I'm sure this flaw isn't intended. I offer a photo of one pump of product in my palm. It spreads over the skin nicely and absorbs well. One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage.  So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it. The container is attractive and it does fit the hand well and feels comfortable to hold.  The product is gentle and feels good on the skin.

3.0,"Shiny finish, not invisible.Glare under lights is visible with fine hair.","They work well, a much needed thing for fine hair and tape in extensions. The key is to use the tape in extension that has tape already, and rather than sandwiching too tape in extensions together (too heavy for fine hair) you use the single sided tape for the other side. I watched many videos on how to do this and I did it myself and they feel fine. There aren't very many pieces in this package for the price, however. It's a bit expensive for only 48 pieces. I nearly used all of them for one application.<br />Update:  After a full month of having the extensions in. Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up.  Impossible to remove without damaging hair. The glue warmed and leaked out the sides over time and caught my hair in the leaked glue. This shortened the length of time I could wear the extensions.

The colors are beautiful and the nail polish goes on great and stays on.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ol4fKtQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ol4fKtQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ol4fKtQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01N3JPJKM,B01N3JPJKM,AHZS32A5BDP7MKKVUGLVB5U3P3VA,1533074818307,0,True
3.0,Odd Texture on My Face,"The one thing I've noticed with Vit C skin serums is you never, ever know what you're going to get. Will it be thick and sticky, will it be hard to absorb, will my face be sensitive to it? I get a different answer with each bottle I've received and I've tried many. This one goes into the hard to smooth and a bit tacky for me category. I also hate for my facial products to have any fragrance. It's like my focus completely goes to that because I am so sensitive to them. I need a little softer serum, probably one that doesn't have the beads and smoothly spreads over my skin. I do think it is healthy and beneficial because of the C and E, but I think I can find slightly better ones more suited to my face.",[],B077YR3333,B077YR3333,AGFVNGZJ4XEFX2ULJNDCWJYRHQVA,1600011409582,0,False

However, this is the best set I've had as far as the included clippers. The ones in here clip so well and many different shapes and areas. I like that they don't feel like they are pulling my nails but rather giving me a clean cut. The angled one allows for me to clip my toenails the way the doctor said to in order to avoid ingrown nails. So far I think these work the best. There are so many utensils that I won't use them all consistently but I will with the clippers and am glad I ave the whole set.",[],B084Z1NLYR,B084Z1NLYR,AGFVNGZJ4XEFX2ULJNDCWJYRHQVA,1596705712069,0,False

My hair is probably just too dry right now and I do prefer those that have a little more styling ability but this is good for when my scalp needs it.

4.0,"Basic, Good Quality, Affordable","So I got this out and started using it on my husband immediately.  It is perfect for cleaning up the hairline.  My husband can't stand hair on his neck so it cleans it up very well.  If you plan to use this to give yourself a haircut, your hair will be very short when done.  It has clips but they aren't for longer hair.  My best friend cuts his own hair but his is longer and he uses a kit that has more clip sizes with it.  If you are concerned you might not know how to use this well, get online and watch videos.  There are so many that will tell you exactly how to do it and how to use clippers.  If you keep your hair very short, this is good to use so you don't have to go back to the barber too quickly and can keep a big haircut at bay.  Look at the width of the head and make sure that suits you.  That was something I hadn't considered until I started using this.  I think it would be easier to maneuver for the beard if it were just a little narrower.  However, with the size it is you can cover more area much more quickly, with fewer passes.  It removes the hair very well with just one pass.  It doesn't come with oil but it is recommended you oil this as needed.  It comes with a cable for charging.  Because it is cordless, I can use it anywhere and that is very convenient.  The clips go one easy and can be a little harder to get off.  The more I'm using them though, the more accustomed to it I am becoming.",[],B078SWLT3L,B07HR5QSN2,AGFVNGZJ4XEFX2ULJNDCWJYRHQVA,1535415555705,0,False

3.0,Beautiful and flawed,"The Norelco arcitec 1050 is beautiful and flawed. The beauty lays in the eye catching design and craftsmanship found in the shaver, the flaw--unfortunately--is in it's primary purpose, which is, as a shaver. As it turns out, I've owned two other Norelcos and a mid-range Braun which have proven to be dependable, well made and produce a good, clean shave. The Norelco arcitec 1050, while doing reasonably well at the job of cleaning the scruff off one's mug, seems to require more passes to do the same thing the older models managed with one. The trimmer is also different. The idea is that you must pop off the razor head to get use of it. A novel idea I suppose, but I cannot say that it is any better or worse than the trimmer on my old Norelcos, though it is narrower. Want to buy an Norelco arcitec? Then the 1050 is absolutely the model you should get as the much pricier 1090 is identical in every respect except that the LED array includes a battery charge countdown(which ironically draws power), providing you a ballpark idea of when you'll run out of juice. This shaver is still a little expensive (mine happened to be a gift), but it is well made and should provide years of service. I've had mine for over a year and the battery still holds a good charge lasting over a week of daily use. The included travel carrier is useful, though a little tricky to figure out how to use at first.",[],B000PKNPES,B000PKNPES,AESJ4K7LDWQE74WOTAHH44C3WHVQ,1256374555000,4,False

There are 3 sets of tiny teeth on the underside, spaced about 4"" apart from each other that hold the headband in even the finest of hair without being uncomfortable. The teeth are small and probably fragile. These headbands appear to be 2 thinner headbands fused together. The top is completely smooth, the bottom has a small ridge running down the middle. One headband is a rainbow of colors, the other is mottled blue and green. Both headbands are about one inch wide. They do a good job holding fine straight or curly hair away from the face. They fit my 3 year old and my 6 year old perfectly, comfortable without slipping. They are tight on an adult head, and squeeze my skull uncomfortably at the base. In my opinion these are ideal for kids and teens but not so great for adults. The ""end holders"" to keep them in shaper are just tiny sections of thin rubber tubing.

Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel.

My complaint may partly have to do with the way I have my make-up closet organized, but when I reach around and pull a palette out from an angle, the shelf it's on comes out too. I don't think this is a problem if you have the organizer sitting straight in front of you.

You press the light colored end on your face and it soaks up the oil and turns the area black! And it really does soak up oil, but leaves makeup intact.

5.0,Fortunate Discovery,"Purchased on a whim, to see if it would do what other products promised and didn't completely deliver.  It does deliver.  I have an old parquet floor that has aged and faded from before I bought my house.  Other products advertised themselves as restorers for this kind of problem.  They did after a fashion but still left the floor looking mostly the way it was before.  Given my experience with the other products, I didn't have great hopes for this product, but to my surprise, just one application of this beeswax product has pretty much done the trick.  The fading is pretty much gone and the wood has a warm, lustrous look now.  It also brought back the original finish on some items of furniture I tried it on, simply wiping it on the wood.  Instructions are minimal, so use caution with the sponge:  it absorbs the wax, so there is a reserve of wax inside it.  When I went to rinse off the dust from the sponge I squeezed it and wax came out with every squeeze.  The sponge is large and the bottle is small, so getting the right amount of wax on the sponge takes some practice.  Remember: a little goes a long way and the sponge absorbs the wax, so after a while use that instead of continuously reapplying new wax.  A wonderful product.",[],B08X425FHL,B08X425FHL,AHW5F73L2FNUWI6ISC32ELHN3IXQ,1621179705097,5,False

I spritzed some mist on our bedding about an hour before bedtime, and later the slight delicate fragrance was there in a relaxing sort of way.  Not powerful or too flowery for the guys, but a nice calm fresh and peaceful scent that was only minimally noticeable.  The spray has only 3 ingredients listed: water, hibiscus oil, castor oil, - no chemicals, so looks to be pretty pure, and it comes in a clear plastic bottle with plastic pump.

Well, the only thing that showed through was my lips!  That's not what I wanted!  My lips are pretty much wrinkled with lines, and it was obvious that this new lipstick was not going to fill-in on the lips and look good.

For now, I'm not going out in the world to submit my body to any skin-stressing stuff in the air.  So far, I used the very nice cream at bedtime, and in the morning before applying my makeup.  I really like it under my makeup.  The pure white lightweight moisturizing cream spreads easily and soaks in fast, leaving my face and neck feeling ready for anything (perhaps it's coating is boosting my skin's natural immunity = protection).  There is no stickiness, no sheen, no oiliness, and no noticeable coating, just a comfortable feeling like there's nothing there except a clean face ready for the day.  The 1 oz. container is a frosted glass with a subtle light grayish silver plastic lid.  There is a slight scent that is not objectionable, and doesn't last.

The soap actually produces a good amount of a creamy, sudsy lather, and leaves the skin very clean and soft with a nice amount of moisture.

I used this nice soap in my morning shower and was pleased that it produced a lot of rich lather and suds, and it left me feeling super clean.  Listed in it's ingredients is a mixture of Palm oils that are from certified growers of this product, and it contains Shea Butter that helps keep the skin moisturized, and Argan oil that's good for a comfortable and soft feel on the skin.

It's a creamy liquid in a squeezable tube and glides easily over my face.  It covers those blemishes (on me, age spots) and other spots nicely, and more coats can be added if necessary.  I only used one.  It's supposed to be good for all skin types, and is SPF 50.  As for ingredients, don't know, other than there are pictures of 8 flower extracts and a fruit extract, so I'm guessing those are in the mix.  This product is made in Korea, so most of any writing is in Korean. (There was also some samples of hair products tucked in the box, that was nice.)

The oils were listed on the Amazon site, the actual product box is written in Korean.  It's a matte, so no gloss, just actual color.  The square black plastic tube has a magnet installed to make sure the top stays in place, a nice feature.  *Now, about the color....I got this because it's supposed to be ""Magenta"".  To my reasoning, the color Magenta is a red/blue, purplish-red shade.  This Magenta (MO6) is closer to a muted Scarlet, an intense red with a bit of orange.....no blue at all.

The lipstick itself is the usual swivel type, but with my lipstick when I swiveled it up to use, it didn't want to swivel back down into the protective tube.

The SPF 31 is supposed to be great if out in the sun, but this product doesn't really feel like it's absorbed into my face, leaving it shiny.  I don't want it dripping down into my eyes!  If I happen to touch my face it leaves a slick film on the fingers, and I worry about touching anything else and leaving a smudge of the tint.  The moisturizer has an unusual scent when applied, smelling like natural clay.  Maybe that's the Zinc Oxide?  After a while it's not quite as noticeable.  I usually use a same brand moisturizer with SPF 15 and the liquid foundation also SPF 15, and they appear to be much better absorbed into my face.  If this product works for others, that's good.

I have other cheap hair brushes, and now I know what to look for in a hair brush. It is such a convenient size too. It can fit in my purse, my clutch purse even.<br /><br />This works great on my short hair, but if you have thick or very long hair, you might want to look for a bigger brush. It's great for a quick touch up, I think I'm going to keep it in my car, when I'm short on time and don't want to fumble through my purse, I'll have it handy in my side door pocket or glove compartment. This will even work on my baby grandson's hair. It is soft and gentle.<br /><br />This brush measures about 6&#34; in length. It is a perfect size to even carry in your pocket in you need to.<br />This is a really good company that will give you a 100% Money Back Guarantee! You really won't need to return it, if you know right off from the start that it is a small brush and that it works great for a quick touch up, children's hair, fine hair and I read from other reviews that it works great as a beard brush.<br />I received this item at a discount for my honest review of this boar bristle brush.

However, when I received it, I realized I don't have time to just lay down and relax for 15 mins!  (unless I was in a tanning bed, and I might be able to encorporate this into that time).  So, I gave this to a girlfriend of mine at work because she had been talking about wanting one.  She's had it for a little over a month and she's loving it.  I have been able to tell a difference in the texture of her skin.  She says it's softened and tightened and is diminishing some of the fine lines around her eyes.  She has some pimples pop up now and again but since she's been using this she hasn't had a breakout.<br />The equipment itself is very good quality and well made.  It has multiple colors for different effects.  It's very nice that it comes with it's own dermaroller.  She hasn't had any trouble with it, but I'm glad to see from other reviews that customer service is fantastic.<br />She told me to give 5 stars and absolutely recommend this.

5.0,Rechargeable!  It included 4 attachments:  All useful items.  Good price!,"MatrixSight Set (4 in 1) Epilator/Callus Remover is very nice device for women.  I mainly use to remove Callus and it works great.<br /><br />But for review purpose, I used Epilator adaptor and it pulls hair gently and quickly without irritating skin .  It hurts little bit like anything else that pulls hair out of the skin, I wouldn’t lie. But, it’s quick and safe to pull hair.  Unlike waxing, it doesn’t leave skin red or peel the skin.  I can see if someone has lots of hair to pull out, it can be very painful.  I would suggest to put “numbing ointment” about 15 min prior to using Epilator can help ease the pain.  Good thing about using Epilator is, eventually, no hair will grow on your legs.  I have been using Epilator for multiple years and now, my legs doesn’t have any hair. If any, it will be one or two strand of hair and I can even use tweezers to pull it out.<br /><br />Best part of this device is, it’s rechargeable.  I have another one (pretty popular one on the market) and its battery operated and after just couple of use, I need to replace battery.  Just past 3 months period, I think I’ve spend more money on batteries than actual price of devices.  So, I was very happy to see this is rechargeable.<br /><br />I have no use for clippers and trimmers for myself, but my husband does use it. So, we are using all adaptors that came with this device.<br /><br />I had an opportunity to purchase this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

4.0,My cellulite looks less pronounced.,"When I start using instaNatural Cellulite Cream, my cellulite wasn’t too bad. But I still want to get rid of them completely, if possible, for sure.<br /><br />I’ve used topical lotion to get rid of cellulite in the past and some worked and others no so much.  So, I wasn't sure what kind of results this cream will deliver.  Most of the review shows awesome results and I wanted to try this cream.<br /><br />It's been a month since I start to use this.  I am pretty sure every skin/body types react to cream differently and some may show results sooner and others may take longer.  Unfortunately, I have skin type that takes while to get used to the product.  As expected, this cellulite cream does work, but not as fast as some reviewers indicated.<br /><br />On 3rd week of using this cream, my cellulite does look less noticeable.  I did what I call &#34;pinch test&#34; (pinch my skin and see if skin dimples, how the dimple looks - pronounced, slight or none, etc) and skin looks much smoother.  I believe it would get rid of them if I continue using this cream.<br /><br />This is very thick cream. Even if it isn't for the cellulite, it smells good and it make my skin soft.<br />Also, I didn’t shower or bath at least hour after I applied cream. I think I have body type that takes longer to see the results than other people. I still have about 1/3 left in the jar, so I will keep using it until it is gone.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received sample box of this item from seller to check out and write my personal opinion. The Company/Seller did not influence in anyway how I rate this product. What I wrote in my review, whether good or bad, is voluntary and entirely my own with the intent of helping Amazon Customers make the right buying decision and increase awareness,",[],B00PKIE760,B00PKIE760,AEKLGG3IBQ3F3YJVAZP4I4T5473Q,1452521401000,0,False
4.0,Great lip color for the price. It is ULTRA Pigmented color.,"wow!  Speaking of solid, strong color!  It's opaque color and what you see from the bottle is what it will be on your lips.<br />It doesn't last all day, but  it does stay longer than regular lipstick. If you have lipstick sealer , it will last much longer. (I got it from local store that goes over the long lasting lipstick. it is solid stick, looks white, but it goes on clear and glossy)<br /><br />This lipsticks leave some kind of residue on my lips after apply.  I wouldn't say it's waxy, but it has slight wax feel to it.<br />It also stains lips. For me, I am not used to wearing this strong color lipsticks, so I apply this colors on and let it sit for little bit. Then, I will wipe it off and put lip gloss over it.  I have to be careful  not to smudge around the lips when I wipe the lipstick out. Otherwise, it loos like kids put on lipstick-mess!  So far, I found  'work around ' to use the lipstick.

I had to use glue dots to get some of them to stick, or blow dry the metal pans first to get the glue to be more sticky. Once you put the pans in place in the magnetic palette, don't move them or the glue will come unstuck. I did clean the bottoms of the pans first with alcohol but no luck. The other tip I have is make sure to carefully and patiently remove every layer of cardboard around the pans in your old palette before trying to remove the pans with the spatula.

I take a spot on one of my walls, put a decent size large hook with the ball at the end of the hook. I attach them to my wall. When I'm done using the wig, I take it off my head, make sure its combed out to its natural state & hag them on the hook to dry. DO NOT BLOW DRY. Comb from the BOTTOM up. And that's it.

Received confirmation and updates about the shipping.<br />The hair is AMAZING!!!! A perfect match with a frontal from a different vendor. (Ordered frontal before buying this hair) I've washed this hair several times and let it air dry. The wave pattern always bounces back. This hair can be styled many ways. I've had it flat ironed, barrel curl, wand curl, and spiral rod curls. This hair holds curls very well and after a few days, the curls open and fall so natural. After having it installed as a sew in for 2 weeks, I took it out and made a wig. This is much more conveinent for maintenance. Hair is still beautiful and going strong. I haven't experienced shedding because I did not cut the wefts, nor did I sew through them. This is the best hair I have received in comparison with expensive brands that I've used in the past. I also take good care of the hair and wrap it up at night when it is installed.<br />A bonus is receiving eyelashes, although I don't wear them.

5.0,Smmooooth!,"This set includes a foot rasp, a foot file, three different nail clippers, and a sapphire nail file.<br /> You can use these on dry or damp skin. I prefer to use on dry skin. The clippers can be used on your  toenails or fingernails. I even use it for my cuticles.<br /> I have never used a foot rasp before this one. (It's the one with the white handle and it's double-sided.) You don't need to soak your feet prior to using it. It is used to remove thick callused skin on your feet. I guess I'm lucky because mine were not that thick! I used  it mostly on my heels just to smooth them out.  That way your feet look better when you wear those sandals in the summer!<br /> I like the two with handles because they are easier than using a lava stone or hand scrubber.<br /> I really like the Sapphire nail file – – it works great.  I do my own nails, so it's wonderful!<br /> I would recommend this set for someone.<br />  I did receive a discount  for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion; which is exactly what I've given you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710bceOUvXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710bceOUvXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710bceOUvXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CoCha0N+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CoCha0N+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CoCha0N+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NhdVTD0+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NhdVTD0+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NhdVTD0+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TewAp5nfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TewAp5nfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TewAp5nfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YzbSX1BfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YzbSX1BfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YzbSX1BfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nT3CZX8UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nT3CZX8UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nT3CZX8UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-zb32G7JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-zb32G7JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-zb32G7JL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QWHuhHJyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QWHuhHJyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QWHuhHJyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01DWY0SMA,B01DWY0SMA,AFCE6VYSB7ROJADURMY35KRBGGCA,1466989179000,0,False

I like Moroccan Oil Shampoo but it is far more expensive & although it says it is sulfate Free there is a little to make it lather.

I have tried other Korean brands without any success at all and have always gone back to this brand every time.  I soak my feet prior to use for about 10-15 minutes to soften them up.  Then, I put the socks on and add in the liquid, tie them up and put loose cotton socks over them.  I sit and relax for about an hour and a half while the AHA does it's work.  After that, I just rinse my feet off and wait for the peeling.  Two to three days later, my feet will start peeling. Don't peel the skin off like you do for a sunburn.  Just let the skin slough off.  I like to soak my feet a couple more times during the peeling process.  When the peeling is all done (in about 5 days or so) my feet are so soft.  There are no dry heels, no rough spots, just beautiful baby soft skin.  It's recommended not to do these peels more than every 3 or 4 months.  I stick to that.  I normally do one per season.

5.0,I've never had bad skin before,"I'm in my early 30s, and I've been breaking out with pimples on my face for the past few years. I've never had bad skin before, but I'm back in school and working full time, so maybe the stress is causing my breakouts. Anyway, I've tried SO MANY treatment options: salicylic acid products, benzoyl peroxide treatments, charcoal soap, sodium bentonite clay mask, oil facial wash, and finally a prescription for tetracycline. The only treatment that worked for me was the prescription, BUT it makes birth control pills INEFFECTIVE!!! No thanks, I'm not getting pregnant for the sake of having a clear face. So I finally stumbled across this sulfur-based product at Walmart this week. Wow, I'm so impressed and thankful I found this little tube of beige goo.<br /><br />I used it as a spot treatment the very first night I purchased it. My two forehead pimples that previously became gooey (again) overnight were dry! The next morning I used the creme all over my face, under my foundation. Again, my pimples stayed dry throughout the day, AND the overall oiliness of my skin was much improved! Finally! I think I've found something that actually works. Happy dance!!<br /><br />Note, it does NOT provide much coverage (for me, anyway). But I just applied my normal concealer over this product, and it worked beautifully. Because the pimple stayed dry, I didn't have to reapply concealer.<br /><br />It does have a *slightly* unpleasant odor, but I only smell it occasionally. I doubt anybody else can smell it unless they're, like, licking your face or are sitting WAY within your bubble of personal space.<br /><br />I'm so happy the sulfur is helping my skin.

Also, it doesn't stink the room up with a strong perfume scent when I put it on, which is important when working in an office with several other people.

5.0,Minty Miracle!,"More Than Clean is a combination scrub and masque recommended for morning use.  You work it into your skin for a couple of minutes, then leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.  There are no unpronounceable ingredients in it, and it smells like peppermint.  It's a very thick bilious colored liquid dispensed through the bottle cap.  I've used it four times with great results on my skin and one unexpected but welcome side effect.<br /><br />The MTC initially feels like mud, but there's a really refreshing tingle that's just great first thing in the morning.  If you're of the generation that used a product called Seabreeze, that's exactly the sensation, only stronger.  The tingle doesn't go away until the stuff is rinsed off, either, and skin feels really clean.  I have some large pores around my nose, and they're thoroughly flattened by<br />this stuff.<br /><br />If you have dry skin, go easy with this, and use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I have an oily T Zone with dry cheeks, and have learned to concentrate on my oily areas with the MTC, with just a quick once over on the dryer areas of my face.  I've been using this just before showering in the morning, and then using the shower to rinse it off--and here's the unexpected side effect: my miserable early spring sinuses have improved!  I think it's the herbs in the product coupled with the steam from the shower, but my whole sinus area feels SO much more open.  Hooray!<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this product.  My skin feels awake and energized, and the products I use daily--serums, moisturizer, and BB cream--just sink right in after use.  I was provided a bottle of More Than Clean for review, and am delighted to do so.  I really like the effect on my skin, and love breathing easier.

With darker shades of hair still naturally in my brows, but too much silver to use black or dark gray anymore (which make me look like an angry troll), these medium gray shades, Liz and Grace, work much better. If you are looking for a cool toned option (no brown or red), and have 50% or more gray/silver in your once dark brows, this is your ideal solution. I fall into the forgotten shade in so many makeup brands of eyebrow pencils and powders. You can’t easily find shades like these in any store. If you have been unsuccessful in your search of the ever elusive cool and actually gray eyebrow pencil, you have stumbled into the right place. Buy this for sure.

4.0,Love!,"First, I'll say this: this is a beautiful set of brushes, and I absolutely love them. It was like Christmas morning, opening this package!  However, the largest brush got incorrectly placed in the packaging at the manufacturing/assembly point (see photo), and the bristles on that side are now misshapen.  Obviously, that will affect the performance of the brush, and I'm not going to mess with washing it and trying to reshape the bristles (which probably won't work anyway).  So I ordered another set, and the first defective one will be returned.  Hopefully, the second one will be better.  I docked a star for this, but if the second one comes in better shape, and the brushes hold up long-term (or don't), I may change my rating.<br /><br />EDIT: Ordered a second one, but waited to send back the first one.  So glad I did.  The replacement was in worse shape than the first, with THREE brushes shifted out of place and potentially crimped in the same way (see photo).  So I didn't even open it, I just sent the second one back.  More care needs to be taken by the seller and manufacturer.  If you don't mind dealing with this type of hassle, try them.  I'm hoping that my large brush's shape self-corrects after I wash it for the first time.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqf1BjgyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqf1BjgyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hqf1BjgyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81izWu5xPbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81izWu5xPbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81izWu5xPbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08YR3JMCG,B08YR3JMCG,AHIEUYZU7RDD5LVP665QOM2QPPQQ,1624205880567,3,True

I bought it for myself, but I was so impressed with the set that I bought two more (as Christmas gifts) when they were on sale for ten bucks.  I don't paint my nails much, but I finally gave this a try about 10 days ago. It went on beautifully, with full coverage in one coat. It dried super fast & was hard as nails when dry (about 10-15 minutes). Once it was completely dry, it had absolutely no odor. Zero. This is something that's important to me because I'm sensitive to fragrances. As the days went by, it held up extremely well. It didn't chip at all, but just wore off naturally on the very tips of my nails. Looked like a natural grow-out, instead of chipping. Ten days later, it was finally time for a re-do. I was very impressed with this product, all around (at least the peach, which is the only one I've tried so far).

If you're wearing a sleeveless shirt and don't want your bra straps to show, it will hold them in place well and keep them hidden.  However, my favorite way to use them is on old bathing suits that have the straps all stretched out.  I use one of these, and the bathing suit becomes an X back that has renewed life in it.  I like to wear old bathing suits this way to work around the yard and in my garden, with a pair of shorts over them.  I originally got these two years ago for my sister's wedding, but I have since worn them many times.  Yes, eventually if you use them hard they will snap and break.  But they are great to have on hand.  I don't find them that hard to put on.  If my husband is available, I'll ask him to put them on for me once my suit is on.  But if he's not, I will put then on the bathing suit carefully and then step into the suit.<br /><br />Update on 8/1/11 I reordered four packages of these, which as pictured are the exact same ones I got before.  What I received was a different product.  I am not thrilled with the new improved version.  They don't sit completely flat like the old ones did.  I think I'm going to return three of the packages, or maybe all four.  I'm disappointed that I didn't receive the tried and true ones that I ordered.

4.0,Spill proof lid yeah not quite,"Cup seems very good quality. I bought this SPECIFICALLY for the spill proof lid. The slider part leaks like a sieve. I spilled hot coffee as soon as I started moving. NOT COOL. I'm really not happy but can't justify spending almost HALF of what I paid to send it back. MAJOR disappointment.<br /><br />***update*** 3/29/17<br /><br />So after my initial review on this cup expressing my extreme disappointment with the so-called spill proof lid, I was contacted buy a customer representative from Gus. He expressed his apologies and they ended up refunding my total purchase price even after I told them they didn't have to and sent me a replacement lid.<br /><br />Unfortunately they did not understand my complaint was not about the rubber gasket around the lid itself but the slider that covers the drinking hole. It is the slider that leaks because it does not seal. I informed them of my opinion on the design, which is I believe is a poor design for what is supposed to be a spill free top.<br /><br />Having said that, the Cup itself is absolutely fantastic. It's well-made and does indeed keep my coffee hot for quite a while. I have not tested it with cold yet. The way Gus stands behind their product definitely tells me that there concern is for customer satisfaction.<br /><br />They were very prompt and courteous. I really can't ask any more of them. I have put the rating up to 4. If nothing else it's  because of the simple fact they reached out to me to try and make it right. That to me speaks volumes of this company's commitment to ensuring their customers are happy. That's not something you see a whole lot of these days.<br /><br />If they can come up with a design that makes the lid truly spill free I would definitely buy this again.",[],B01M1DZ7X8,B01M1DZ7X8,AG5SNCL4FSHAAB4MFKI3YU5ZAEMQ,1490270606000,5,True

Luckily, because the Amazon app is so awesome, I was able to promptly purchase a new jar for myself with the swipe of a thumb. Now I am much better at remembering to take my pomade with me when I leave the gym. Thank you for asking.<br /><br />The only solace I have in accidentally leaving this terrific product behind not once, but twice, is that I believe someone in my gym likely found it, opened the jar, applied a little of this awesome sauce to their hair and BOOM! They found themselves rocking hair game they never knew was possible. I like to think that I have spread the gospel of Sloane to the good people of Richmond, Virginia.<br /><br />If you are considering buying this product, know that it was life-changing enough to ruin my day both times that I left it at the gym, only to be restored again upon receiving it in the mail two days later via Amazon Prime.

5.0,Awesome for Cold sores/Herpes simplex 1 sufferers,"I never heard of this before until a friend turned me on to it saying it's been used to treat cold sores. I thought, why not I was desperate as I've suffered from cold sores since childhood (I'm over 40 btw). I have tried many things, diet changes, protection on lips when out in the sun and wind, I still get those painful cold sore blisters that last for days and crack and bleed when you smile or eat. It's annoying as heck. This is the best thing ever and I'm posting on here in hopes that some poor soul out there will benefit as much as I have. Basically at the first sign of a cold sore when y ou feel the tingly, sensitive feeling or see the first sore, just dab a bit on 2x a day or more if you are constantly wiping it off somehow. It will not spread or grow at all. For the first time yesterday I put a bit on after the cold sore grew a bit and basically it stopped it from growing and has made it disappear over 2 days in a non painful way at all. This is magical. Sadly not advertised as a cold sore medicine. Also, so many more expensive options for herpes simplex 1/cold sores do not work! This is more affordable. This container will last forever because I typically use maybe 1/2 pinky nail each time. Good luck! *Update, I had a dry rash around my neck for months, nothing too serious but slightly itchy every now and again. I put some of this cream on it 2x/day for about 10days, gone. Hasn't come back, it's been over a month. I just figured if it worked on coldsores, it would work on my rash. Great stuff!",[],B0070Z7KME,B00J7QCNDU,AGSJAIZAZDMDU2QROWBNTQMG2AXA,1506043399583,1,False

5.0,Squeaky clean beard!,"[[VIDEOID:bbcdf66b3364ec66a30d9ba4ba9d201d]] My bottle of Beardsmen Spirit Beard Shampoo arrived today right before I was about to get in the shower.  I quickly opened the product and went to use it.  The Bold Forest scent was very nice.  I always wash my beard at the end of my shower so as to not let the smell of my beard wash be diminished by other scents from hair and soap on my face.  I put a nickel sized drop of the shampoo into my hand and then worked it together with the other hand.  I can really smell the Eucalyptus smell as it gives way to almost a menthol scent.  I made sure my beard was wet and ready for the shampoo.  I worked the shampoo into my beard for about 30 seconds or so with my fingers and at the end of that had a really nice lather going on.  After the lather, I just stood there for about another minute and allowed the shampoo to just sit in order to get the smell really worked in there.  I made sure to thoroughly rinse out the product and man was my beard squeaky clean after that.  After drying off and getting all the water out of my beard, I smelled it and there was a faint scent of the shampoo left over from the shower.  I followed up the shampoo with Beardsmen Spirit Beard Oil in the Bold Forest scent.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I did receive a discounted price in order to try this product and provide an unbiased review.

2.0,Mine had defects,"First, the good: hair is soft, silky and only a tiny bit too shiny. It has good style and only shed a small amount on removing from package and brushing. Not too much hair, but not thin or flimsy. Has two combs at the top in front to secure wig, and the adjustable latches at the neck. I was prepared to love it forever and buy ten more. However:<br />The not so good and the bad: the color is flat black, there is no natural color variation and looks like a poor dye job, the ear tabs did not align with my actual ears, and so poked out to the sides a bit. The hair line would not lay flat to my head, and when I tried to pull some of the front strands to the side to keep them out of my eyes, I saw that the seams are thick and obvious. Since it has a bit of lace at the top I figured to reset the part, but there is a seam in the middle of the lace, so parting it<br />in any other location within the lace area literally shows a fat black seam.<br /><br />Now, I am not a wig expert. I don't know how to make a mediocre wig great, and to this wig's credit, it is better than mediocre. So if you happen to be one of those people with such knowledge, this is a fabulous wig to mess with and work your magic on. And perhaps my particular wig is a defect that slipped through, but regardless, it is a disappointment to me.

1.0,"Not pure rice powder, HAS TALC","This is not pure rice powder. The main ingredient in this is talc.

Overall, I'm very unhappy with the ingredients in this and I think there could have been more transparency about the formula from the vendor.<br />I will say if you are looking for an old school setting powder this might work for you.  However, I would not recommend this for anyone who has sensitive skin or who is prone to acne.<br /><br />The full list of ingredients for this is: Talc, Calcium Carbonate.

I was hoping for the inner layer to be of softer materials like some better quality shower caps made in east Asia. 2) The size is quite small-i happened to have a small head for an adult (typical hats are always too big for me) and these fit *very* snugly even on me. These will definitely be too small for people with bigger heads. 3) since the material is stiff and the caps are made small, there's not much room for long hairs-you can only use them if you have a small head with short hairs, or if you're a child.",[],B06XHJW64J,B06XHJW64J,AHZTG6U3OI5ZWGMHYLDV3WOC5YVA,1496208144000,1,True

Nope, not this time.  The hair dryer at 1800watts packs a windstorm in the little pink thing.  I don't use the diffusers, so I tossed those out with the packaging (which i seriously want to save to wrap presents, it's that pretty).

5.0,"Great nail polish, healthy and effective","I am a huge fan of this brand of nail polish. I started using them due to toenail fungus, and a stubborn fingernail fungus -- thanks to gel polishes from the nail salon. I discovered Dr's Remedy polishes a couple of years ago, and have totally switched to this brand. They are also good if you have aging, yellowing nails. The polish clears that up -- especially if you consistently use their base coat first.<br /><br />If I have any complaints or suggestions, I would say that they need to add more shades -- especially shades in the neutral family. Some nudes, darker beiges, etc. The khaki shade is a nice neutral but a bit too pale;, and the few sheer shades they offer are very nice for long-lasting daily wear. I do wish there were more sheer shades -- and maybe a sheer lavender shade that would help combat the yellowed appearance of the nail.

(I once had an Essie polish like this called Ballet Slippers, which this is similar to.) Other polishes in this line are opaque, in richer colors -- so be advised to look at those if you want more coverage. However, this one wears very well and doesn't show chips like deeper colors.

When the dipping polish was removed at the salon, my remaining natural nails were terribly damaged and I had a fungus infection in one of my finger nails.<br /><br />I ended up discovering Dr.'s Remedy polishes in order to heal the infection and disguise my ruined nails as they grew out. I will not wear any other polish now -- to avoid future infections. This is a nice product. The sheer shades work best for me, and I apply a coat or two over the Dr.'s Remedy base coat -- which helps the polish go on more evenly.  So much healthier for my nails.

5.0,Works as the other 50+ raters have stated...,"I have adult onset acne. I have had it for over a decade. Nothing would cure it. Benzyl peroxide makes me break out worse and rash up. >2% salicylic acid spot treatment products help, but nothing really evened everything out and made the acne start to go away. I wouldn't say this is a miracle, but it certainly is the only thing that I have found in the past 10 years that works (and yes I have seen 3 dermatologists for this issue with no permanent resolution).<br /><br />The Routine:<br />I apply this glycolic product 1x at night and a light face moisturizer 1x in the morning (plus an eye cream when I remember). I started seeing immediate results within less than 2 weeks. I also, after reading so many scarey reviews about negative product interactions, am happy to report that I had NO additional breakouts with the product and only light tingling for the first few minutes of application. I would compare this tingling to the feeling you get just after applying a witch hazel cotton pad (for those with pain concerns regarding the 'tingle' reported by others).<br /><br />Regarding Results 2 Weeks In:<br />For those of us that have had long term acne and know how good we look in summertime (due to the sun hiding your acne spots) this is how I feel now, two weeks later, when I see myself in the mirror. I don't know how well it will treat these recesses (old acne scars) I have in my cheek area, but the red splotches are gone and skin tone has evened substantially.<br /><br />I also should be honest and say that the use of a glycolic product was recommended to me from my identical twin sister (yay for matching DNA and two people trying to solve the same problem at once). Anyways, she used a similar AHA product for a year (not this one exactly). However, her acne, red splotches, break outs, and scars are completely gone after 1 year of use of an AHA glycolic product. After seeing her results I thought I would find a similar product to try. (keeping fingers crossed over this year!)<br /><br />Opinion Section:<br />I saw a number of negative reviews. In reflection, I would suspect that sensitive youth skin may not benefit as much from this product as adult skin. I noticed that the product is far less drying on my face than advertised by others. Heck, I don't even bother to moisturize at night and have no ill over-drying effects. However, I worry that if you are purchasing the product for 'oil control' or have much oil production on your face this may aggravate your acne situation. I only comment this because when I get up in the morning I can still feel this product on my face - it's not greasy or oily, I just feel a sheen. This could explain some of the negative posters comments. In my experience, I think youth acne needs drying more than adult acne, which needs exfoliation. If you are in your mid 20s and up (and DO NOT have sensitive, oil - prone, raging hormone youth skin), then this product is relatively inexpensive and delivers!<br /><br />PS: If there is a youth out there that has the opposite of this experience, please flag this (if this review section will allow it) to remove this last paragraph for accuracy as i do not want my speculation to mislead people on a product that is in my opinion, from first hand experience, absolutely wonderful.",[],B000G8LWZI,B000G8LWZI,AFBUEKUYLGIQMA2XC26CXYIHNIFA,1347936564000,5,False

I was even able to insert a 30ml bottle into the foam as well because it will stretch for fit and didn’t have a problem closing it. My only regret is not getting a bigger case because my collection is only going to grow. The pockets in the front of the bag are a mesh material but sturdy except they don’t hold the bottles as securely as the foam. So, if you’re going to fill this case I would opt for one that has the number of slots you need in the foam and not rely on the front mesh pockets except for maybe accessories.

So, I was interested to try the Philips PureRadiance brush.  First, the differences:<br /><br />1.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has two speeds, one is gentle and the other is a more intense option.  This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.<br />2.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has rotating bristles plus an pulsing feeling.  The brush head is smaller than Clarisonic, so it is easy to use in small areas such as between your nose and mouth.<br />3.  Similar to the Philips toothbrush, the PureRadiance brush has three timed sessions of 20 seconds each for three zones of your face.  This is beneficial if you have a tendency to over scrub or irritate your skin.<br />4.  The PureRadiance brush is smaller and lighter than the Clarisonic.<br /><br />The PureRadiance is a different experience from the Clarisonic.  It's not bad, just different.  If this is your first facial brush, I think you will like the PureRadiance quite a bit.  If you currently use a different brush, you'll need to compare features.  If a gentle, light, easy to use brush is what you want, the Philips PureRadiance is a nice choice.",[],B00NL5JW6E,B00NL5JW6E,AFDZ4WWFENGLKRK6DMIU7YE3CQTQ,1426181843000,1,False

4.0,Decent Shaver with a few Quirks,"I've been using Norelco shavers since I began shaving.  I briefly tried both another brand and bladed shaving, and didn't like either.  I tried this out as a replacement to my 8140XL.<br /><br />As with most electric shavers on the market, you get convenience, simple charging, savings on consumable blades and cream, and a nice little gadget for your bathroom with this shaver.  A blade always wins on optimum closeness, but takes longer and is more ""dangerous"" to those of us with a not so fine touch.  Those aside, there were a few things that I liked, and a few things that bugged me about this specific shaver.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Lightweight<br />Wow, this shaver is really light and easy to handle when shaving, especially tougher areas that require holding the shaver upright at times.<br /><br />-Waterproof<br />The fact that you couldn't get in contact with water or even in a shower used to be a huge disadvantage to electric razors.  This unit is fully waterproof, which also makes it easier to clean.<br /><br />-Uses Li-ion batteries instead of NiCad<br />One of the things that irked me about the last razor I bought was that it still contained a ridiculously obsolete NiCad battery.  NiCad cells suffer from the ""memory effect"", which means they can hold a smaller and smaller amount of charge over time.  This shaver has Li-Ion, the best kind of battery available, with no memory effect.  This means it will continue to hold the same charge for years to come.<br /><br />-Cool Charger base<br />This is a lot cooler looking, and takes up less space on the countertop than just plugging into the wall and laying the shaver sideways to charge.  It also keeps track of the cord.<br /><br />-Flex Tracker System<br />The head conforms to whatever surface I'm shaving pretty well, and just looks cool.<br /><br />Cons: (these won't apply to everyone, and are my opinion only)<br /><br />-Built in lotion dispenser<br />I've never wanted this feature.  It's simply another way for them to continue to charge for refills of the product, when part of the reason for having an electric razor is so you don't have to keep paying for blades!  I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn't enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  The stuff doesn't smell too great either.  You don't need this goop to use the shaver, so I would skip it.<br /><br />-Not as speedy as older models<br />This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  It's not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not slower.<br /><br />-40 minutes of charge time<br />This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this shaver, it has some great features you'll probably enjoy.  You might want to be aware of the cons I've noted, and keep in mind you can follow up on Norelco's guarantee if you're not happy with your individual shave.",[],B000UK2VRK,B000UK2VRK,AF2ACCKOTUKHIGCZHGHSZXMJDTKQ,1215734124000,0,False

Each bottle of gel polish is nestled in a foam cradle.  Black bottles cradled in black foam.  Drametic.<br /> One con would be the lableing of whats inside the bottle.  You have to open each little bottle to determind the acti\ual color. they are labled at the bottom .  ie. CLo34?<br />I am a fan of gel nail polish, as properly apply can your nails remain hard as rocks, shinny as the day applyed and no chipping, At present my nails are 5 weeks and counting.<br />I garden, digging in plants nestled in greenhouses, as snow lay on the ground.<br />I am very hard ...no....extremely hard on nails.  Until gel nail polish came into the home.<br />I digress, back to the labeling of the color of the nail polish.  ( like swatching watercolors to evaluate color) The coloors are as follows  Number one Clo90-A beautiful soft cloude like pink.  Second color CLO34-Violet  Third color CLO67 (The one is like ...would be a grey, soft and medium blue/grey...next CLO16 another cloud pink only a slightly medium  humm two pinks?  number five CLO11 medium wine..YAH! another grey but a shade bluer in tint.<br />I had to wait to try out the two greys .... why take off a 5 week polish....waiting...ok, the Gel nail greys.<br />Appled a very thin of polis, went on well, cured  second coat of grey and one nail the second  grey ...cured.. beautiful nail application...If, I say I can,<br />Waiting for q chip to appear.  Nope! 4 weeks and still a beautiful nails .... while the nail remain hard ...your natural nails grow ..and grow.  ..<br /><br />I did not take a trip to their web sight as I am pleased with but, they give you the entire procedure. If, you are still paying $45.00 each time you visit your beauty shop ... invest in a uv/led nail and toes  machine and the collect ion from Laguna Moon ...Amazon ...of course.<br />I can highly recommend this product.",[],B01KJPFO9W,B01KJPFO9W,AH5HU2SCRFXRIBZHNTHBRUVOUSJA,1546464062975,0,False

Also, when I compared it to the real EZ Braid hair, the color is not 1B - it is much darker.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1cHNwRclSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1cHNwRclSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1cHNwRclSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1Ad+CNQqTS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1Ad+CNQqTS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1Ad+CNQqTS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1g0lp9nwrS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1g0lp9nwrS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1g0lp9nwrS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B089215HQ5,B089215HQ5,AESWYBIAFKOAISDQP3BWLMUJ2BQA,1628642910253,0,True

5.0,High end features on an affordable watch.,"The Invicta pro diver has a reputation for being the best most affordable submariner homage watch on the market. This one might be better.

The crowned octopus on the face and engraved on the case back are really attractive in my opinion. The Invicta will give you a Seiko automatic movement with a display case back which is nice too. But I'm ok with quartz and no one accept the wearer cares if it a quartz anyway and quartz keeps more accurate time. The Phoibos is available from some vendors with an automatic movement but that version is way more than an Invicta pro diver. So both this model and the Invicta pro diver are good bargain watches but I think this Phoibos has a little more charm and some features usually reserved for more expensive watches.

I have naturally curly hair, and most of the time, I just want to smooth out my curls , and not necessarily straighten them. Before getting the straightening brush, it took me a good 15-20 minutes using a large barrel curling iron to soften my curls, but with this, it’s 5-6 minutes tops. It is very simple to use- once you plug the brush in it heats right up to temperature within seconds and is ready to go. It also, this comes with a comb that can help hold the hair in place while using the brush, but I have not had any need to use it. I simply section off my hair in four large segments and run the brush through each segment 2-3 times and I am done. The brush also cools down quickly after you turn it off, which is great for traveling purposes. Overall, I love the brush, and I get the results I want very quickly and require less time fixing my hair and exposing it to as much heat.

Mine arrived completely strewn about inside the bubble mailer — their flimsy plastic bag had busted open during shipping — and several butterfly wings were bent askance.

4.0,"A generous, potent bottle of lavender essential oil.","This is my first foray into essential oils and I'm liking it a lot. I'm using the oil in two ways: for aroma and, in theory, for its physiological properties. I like diffusers a lot but am too cheap and suspicious of additives to buy them often. I've been using this lavender oil along with some safflower oil and rubbing alcohol in my bedroom and it adds a nice, luxurious touch to bedtime. I've sprinkled a bit on my body pillow, too, when I feel like I want a much stronger dose of the relaxation.<br /><br />I read somewhere that mixing it with a carrier oil (I'm using rosehip oil) and rubbing it on the bottom of your feet can help with insomnia, so I've been doing that. I don't know if it's working, but it is making my feet feel softer, so that's something. I haven't experienced any respiratory or skin irritation with this product.<br /><br />The bottle is a dark brown color so that the light can't get to the oil and break it down. They sent a dropper along with the oil, which I appreciated since I didn't have others. Next I'm going to try to make some kind of reusable sachet for my drawers--I just need to figure out what scent to mix it with first.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I am always conscious and aware of the number of items and possessions I bring into my home and try to make mindful decisions, because The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up told me to. For this reason, I only accept items that I feel will serve me, my family, and my needs. I do not accept items that seem useless or that do not speak to me. If I post a positive review it is because I had a positive experience. If I have only positive experiences, I chalk that up to a successful exercise in mindful purchasing and decision-making. If I have a negative experience, as with any Amazon product, I reach out to the seller or manufacturer and seek assistance or replacement before deciding on a rating.",[],B01IG41ZG4,B01IG41ZG4,AEQONMW2GEVXPIARN4WBM3KAX2VQ,1473818898000,0,False

This polish came off just as easily as any other non-glitter polish. I added the Essie gel set topcoat and the color lasted multiple days, even with typing, washing dishes and playing with my pup.

5.0,Blown Away!,"I can't even believe how crazy-effective this gadget is for grooming my dog. I was skeptical - but desperate. My 35 pound Goldendoodle has been impossible to trim/comb/brush around certain parts of her body. I definitely couldn't trim her nails, even with help, and had to stop taking her to groomers because of this. They just couldn't deal with her. She would whine, contort her body and thrash and because I think biting me was imminent, I muzzled her. I still couldn't get a nail clipper near her. She fought that much. I have been trying to desensitize her since I've had her, and it just hasn't happened. I was nervous about the stability and safety of the harness, but my husband assisted in getting her hooked up, and I made sure I had everything I needed within reach before starting. I definitely would not hook your dog up too high off the ground, or leave him or her alone while in it. I know this sounds dramatic, but this product is life-changing! She was quiet as a mouse, totally still, and let me do everything she has fought me on from day one. I haven't shut up about this thing since using it. You have to keep an eye on how your dog's placement is doing as you go, and that they aren't getting wiggly or pulling their hind legs out. I also rigged up our system so that her front end was slightly higher than her back end - just a little, tiny, bit. This helped in keeping her stable and comfortable as well. If she were any heavier, I would not trust the clips or hooks included, and would purchase more sturdy hardware. However, for the price, it's definitely worth the sling alone.

The manufacturer is very accommodating with these extensions. The micro ring is already installed, and the way they come on a little plastic cord you don't even need the hook to bead the hair. You definitely still could use that and probably would have more control with the metal hook but I 90% installed these just with my fingers and the plastic cord(and pliers of course) I will add a picture once I actually style my hair now that they're on my head lol.

5.0,Inverness makes quality piercing earrings!,"This review is for Inverness 24k Gold Plated 3mm piercing earrings in Amethyst. However I should mention that I have a number of pairs of 14k Inverness Piercing Earrings in many birthstone colors including Rose, Auqamarine, Emerald, Ruby, and Blue Topaz, & Sapphire. In my opinion Inverness makes the best quality piercing earrings on the planet. Besides the birthstone piercing earrings, I have a number of other designs as well, and a couple of months my daughter had her ears pierced with the October Rose color flower earrings, which are perfect for a 6 year-old's first pair of pierced earrings. She now also has a pair of Inverness Rainbow Flower earrings as well which she switched to after her Rose ones had been in for over 6 weeks.<br />When it came time to pierce my daughter's ears, I would not have trusted them to any other piercing system than Inverness, as not only are their earrings second to none when it comes to quality, but the same can be said for their piercing system & piercing instruments. My daughter actually smiled throughout the piercing.<br /><br />Now, about the earrings - These Inverness Piercing Earrings, such as the 3mm Birthstone Post Earrings are extremely well-made with the strong posts that are honed to a sharp surgical point which not only adds to the ease of the piercing, but they are covered in the ear the Inverness Patented Safety Clutch, which is sort of a bell-shaped earring back, that safely covers the point of the post end and cannot by easily removed by little hands.<br /><br />As an adult who at this point has no need to continue to wear piercing earrings, I actually prefer to wear many styles of Inverness Piercing Earrings, and the birthstones are some of my very favorites. I'm sure that there are many adults who had their ears pierced years ago, who still have their Inverness Piercing Earrings in their jewelry boxes, and more importantly still wear them. They are that good.",[],B005KBOTDI,B005KBOTDI,AEFK4A22W4P6TW7ZVV2UJN7Z53RA,1386681009000,1,False

4.0,Great compact unit -- not as strong as others though,"Our last water flosser died -- so it was time for a replacement. This unit is VERY compact, I was actually shocked when it came because I thought there was no way it could fit in there. Lo and behold -- it did! Although this is a permanent fixture on our sink, it could easily travel with us if we went anywhere. Being a compact, travel-friendly water flosser I was surprised at how much volume it can hold. If you can't tell, I'm really impressed by the compact ability of this water flosser.<br /><br />It comes with a variety of tips, enough to make this usable for a couple as my husband and I share it. It is very easy to use, the one call out if you have a more traditional water flosser is that this is a rechargeable unit! It comes with a charging cord (USB), but no base -- so you'll have to grab one of your existing ones and let this charge for about 8 hours -- so you can't use it straight out of the box.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that even at maximum pressure it is not as strong as our previous one. It does work well enough to get any extra stuff out of your teeth after brushing, however, it is not the strongest water flosser -- my husband would like something a bit more strong, but that is really the only complaint we have!",[],B088R5YRMJ,B088R5YRMJ,AG3CK7F7NP5GM6BN6OHZJRWWF7QA,1605721251517,0,False
5.0,Light and gentle as a make up remover,"When I saw the title of cleansing 'jelly' I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a texture standpoint. If I was to try to describe this and provide an example, I would compare it to gel hand soap. It's not thick and viscous at all, it feels much more similar to general gel hand soap. I use this for the days that I wear makeup, it is not a product that I use daily. If I wear anything more than brow filler, then I use this. It's the first step in my routine when I wear make up, as it works well to remove the light foundation and concealer that I use. I use a pump or two and massage it into my face and then rinse with water -- this doesn't lather like washes do, but it works. I does a great job at removing face makeup -- however, I stick to eye makeup remover or micellar water if I wear any eye makeup.<br /><br />Overall this is great for removing makeup. It by no means replaces a face wash, but it's a great pre-step when you have worn makeup during the day. I tried it on a fuller face of makeup and it works wonderfully as well. It has never left my face feeling dry and taut, which I like. It feels very gentle and light.",[],B084XRYZJG,B0914JBBTV,AG3CK7F7NP5GM6BN6OHZJRWWF7QA,1588264015088,0,False

5.0,Great for a lumberjack beard!,"My husband really likes this beard oil. He has a thick beard that our friends describe as a &#34;lumberjack beard.&#34; Since our recent move, he started complaining that his beard became stiffer and more wiry -- I can attest to that, it was more wiry than usual when I got kisses. I saw this beard oil online, and read reviews that the tea tree scent was really pleasant and fresh smelling. When I told my husband about the beard oil, he was somewhat skeptical at first, however, after reading him some reviews, I convinced him that he should take the plunge and try it, for both our sakes. The instructions on the box say to apply the oil prior to styling, but my hubby prefers applying it before bedtime, when he applies his moisturizer. Since he started applying it, he has noticed that his beard, and the skin under his beard has been soft and smooth. It also helps that he really likes the scent. The tea tree scent is very fresh and masculine, and can be worn during the day when going out or to work. It's a bonus that it smells nothing like strong aftershave scents that I am allergic to. I think my hubby will be a loyal customer of beardsmen beard oil! I am attaching a photo of the box with the ingredients listed, which I hope will be helpful, because I couldn't locate the list when I was considering purchasing this.<br />I received this product at a discounted price, and am happy to provide an honest and unbiased review based on my experience with the product.

This mask gives me some of that effect, plus the nice hydration of a typical sheet mask.<br /><br />I thought the guaiazulene mask option was free of fragrance. It’s not. It smells of green tea to me. Fragrance in skincare provides no benefit to the skin, and in fact makes you more likely to develop skin allergies to both fragrance ingredients as well as anything else on your skin. People interested in guaiazulene are looking to soothe their skin - meaning it’s already irritated. The last thing it needs is fragrance.<br /><br />Also, the eyeholes are too small, so the mask touched the outside edges of my eyes. Some of the serum in the mask got in my eyes. It stung. But not too bad.<br /><br />Overall, look elsewhere.

I can see where other reviews felt the need for a moisturizer on their normal to dry skin. I did not feel that need. One benefit, I use a primer on my skin to control oil under my makeup. I used much less of that primer because there was no excessive oil on my skin the next morning. If you struggle with oily skin, this is definite worth a try.",[],B00Q5V41NK,B00Q5V41NK,AE6SS7FM5PSLYTBRGB2IY35ARK2Q,1452432628000,0,False

Decided to try this new brand based on reviews and the fact that my last two dryers only lasted 2 years each. Have to say I am very happy with this new brand and it is definitely MUCH stronger than the drugstore brands. I have shoulder length, fine hair, but a lot of it. I've been frustrated by how long it takes it to dry. This dryer definitely gets the job done quicker . However, it is so strong at the strongest setting, I use the lower one when doing the actually styling. (I've never used anything but the strongest with any other dryer)  If you have short hair, it may dry too quickly with this dryer and you may not feel much advantage to this because you'll need to limit yourself to the lower setting anyway. The dry is smaller than my previous ones, which I like too and is also definitely much quieter.

5.0,Good performance to price ratio,"I rate this five stars since it is a good price for what you get. Some reviewers thought it wasn't very powerful. I suggest it is quiet. Many equate power and performance with loud noise. Perhaps it is more efficient. It does the job just fine. I have a difficult beard and have used Philips Norelco products on it for over 40 years. I passed my 3 year old and more expensive Norelco off to my 90 year old father-in-law and he is thrilled with it. His old, cheap, noisy, corded one was getting too much for him to handle. I bought this as a personal replacement. I was skeptical about being able just to rinse it under hot water, but that works just fine. Battery management is not as good as my previous one (as other reviewers noted) but I can easily get 10 days out of it before recharging. Bottom line, if you want a good battery electric shaver and don't want to spend a lot for features you might not need or want, this will do the job. I note that a ""leading consumer mag"" gave it a good middle of the road rating in this month's issue. That reinforced my feeling that I made a good choice for the price - performance sweet spot. A replacement cutter head set costs nearly as much as the whole razor costs, so when it comes time to replace the heads, I tend to replace the razor with one in that price range.",[],B000FEGUIW,B000FEGUIW,AHINI7NP6VC3XS3WZQAIDWM4EMFQ,1209842562000,1,True

Plus, if you have shorter lashes, you barely can get the tips to grip (unlike, for example, Shu Uemura curler, which has a finer/thinner frame to work with that better fits to the curve and sits closer to your face).<br />So for those not gifted with mile-long lashes, you may want to go with another choice.<br />The mascara is a bit better.<br />But, then again, I mainly was looking for the eye curler.

5.0,Works great at a good price,"The MASWATER hair trimmer is a compact and easy to use nose/ear trimmer. The trimmer comes with a removable head for easy cleaning. The trimmer also has a cap that goes over the trimmer blade area for storage or travel protection. The trimmer did not come with a battery. The trimmer uses one AA battery that is easy to install. The trimmer works well and did not cause any discomfort. There are two-speed adjustments depending on your need. You can rinse the trimmer by either just running water over the trimmer blade area or removing the top of the trimmer to expose the inside of the trimmer/blade area. For the price , the MASWATER works well and is easy to use. I recommend this trimmer.",[],B07H3S8WTV,B07H3S8WTV,AETEEKM7PARPRYDBP4JIH6LIRHJA,1550615880338,1,False
5.0,Leaves my hair soft,"I generally use Pantene and have been happy with how it leaves my hair. Thought I would try TRESemmme to see if I liked it as much as the Pantene. My hair is thin and generally dry. I live in a dry climate and the dryness can take a toll on my hair. The TRESemme shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and it doesn't feel as dry. While the Pantene is for volume, the TRESemme is for nourishing and replenishing my hair. The TRESemme has a nice scent that is not too overpowering.  I may switch off and on between different shampoos and conditioners on a daily basis but I could easily use the TRESemme on a daily basis.",[],B07FM69672,B07FM69672,AETEEKM7PARPRYDBP4JIH6LIRHJA,1544142021385,0,False
4.0,Good package with basic Sonicare toothbrush and Airfloss.,"This package comes with both the Essense toothbrush and the Airfloss.  The Essence is a a basic Sonicare brush without advanced features.  The brush is perfect for first time Sonicare users who don't want to spend a lot.  The toothbrush will do what you need to keep your teeth and gums in good shape without breaking the bank. The Essence does come with a 2 minute timer, which is a great feature at this price range.  The timer really helps you get all your teeth clean without spending too much time in one area.<br /><br />The Airfloss is a nice way to help your gums if you are not fond of doing regular flossing.  Regular floss is the best way to go but if you are like me and are not good at doing that often, the Airfloss is a great way to go to help improve gum health.  I usually put in a fluoride mouthwash into the floss liquid reservoir and that works well.  I find it easy to move around my mouth with the Airfloss and I can complete the flossing very quickly.<br /><br />For the price of this package, you get a good entry level Sonicare and the Airfloss, both will help with improving your teeth and gum health.  I have been using Sonicare for years and really like them as they improve my dental visits.  If you haven't tried out Sonicare give it a try for better gum health.",[],B01M7UMAUG,B01M7UMAUG,AETEEKM7PARPRYDBP4JIH6LIRHJA,1508039027187,0,False
5.0,Good quality and design.,"Wasn't sure what to expect of the LumaRx as far as quality.  In my opinion this is a very nice and high quality product.  From the packaging/box, to the stand, brush, and travel bag, the LumaRx feels like a good quality product.  The brush comes with 3 adaptors for soft, medium, and deeper cleansing.  The individual brushes are easy to take on and off.  The charging stand works great and looks good.  Not big at all and would compliment any bathroom.  The actual brush device is all high quality.  The brush device feels well made, fits into your hand well, and is easy to use.  There are 3 speed settings and the device tells you which setting you are on by a white light that points to the different speed settings on the top of the device.  The light looks and works well.  It is easy to tell which speed you are on by the light.  The travel bag is adequate for this type of device and can fit your device, brush, and power adaptor/stand.  If you like using a facial cleaning brush, this really is a nice product in my opinion.  At the current price point, it might be on the high side for many people, but I do feel this product justifies the price based on the quality.",[],B01BEYRHBA,B01BEYRHBA,AETEEKM7PARPRYDBP4JIH6LIRHJA,1457125787000,0,False

4.0,It is reflective of Braun quality.,"... The self cleaning feature is designed for lazy people. I like it because the cleaning fluid lubricates the blades.

Every other time, clean it.<br />Every 6th time charge it. By blowing every shave and cleaning every other....... you get 90 days out of a fluid refill, not 30.<br />The base detects how much [stuff] is in the fluid, and when it gets too much ,forces you to change cartridges or it will not work.(clean) To make your batteries last an extra year.. once a month let them run down completely, then charge. Theres a difference between being cheap and throwing money away. I just get to buy more toys. Aint that whats its about? Closest shave ever? Not really, but fuctional enough to be worth it.

4.0,Help provide relief for my feet.,"I suffer from having hard skin around the heel and bottom area of my foot.  It gets real hard and I have to soften it up in hot water and Epson salt and use the stone to scrub away the skin.  The hardening of the skin causes me pain and it is hard to walk sometimes.  And doing it manually gets old and tiring.  So my wife suggest I trying something like this.  I was not sure if I wanted to use this but I am so happy I did.  It makes things so much easier.  I don't have to worry about scrubbing and scrubbing non stop.  Just pop in two AA batteries (not included) and put it against your skin and let it do the work. The callus remover comes with three extra heads that you can interchange as you need to.  The clean up is easy as well because the kit has everything.  No more pain in my foot and I am very grateful for that.  Overall the machine is good.  I wish it was more powerful but that is the Home Improvement side of me talking. Haha.  I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced price so that I would give my unbiased honest opinion, which I did. That did not influence me in any way.

The powder itself is stored in the cap so it refreshes each time you close it.<br /><br />The 24 eyebrow styles are a bit overwhelming but maybe some people like to have that much choice. The shapes all need to have the center pushed out of the plastic before use; they come with it still tacked on in place.<br /><br />The brush and spoolie are small so I recommend using your own as this one is hard to hold.

The only down side of these loofahs is that they are very stiff & thick which can make them hard to mold and fold when washing your skin, also, it absorbs body wash soap so you are require to keep adding more body wash soap to create a soapy lather to scrub your body. Overall, great quality, hope these loofah break down and becomes softer!",[],B08B5FJMHM,B08B5FJMHM,AFYQW5HOAUGTYIZL2LIELN2CVYKQ,1598545486713,1,True

Basically, this product is perfect!<br /><br />It did everything it claims, cleanses, moisturizes, and detangles. That last part was very important for me since my hair tends to become very matted within days if I'm not careful. With such thick hair, it's difficult for me to manually detangle my hair. I've even had a hair stylist make me comb through my own hair to give her a break once when I went for a relaxer many years ago. This product was so good at detangling, that I only needed to do a once through before I was able to put it up to dry.<br /><br />The moisture level is on point!

1.0,Received a used machine and it broke after less than 5 months of use,"I received a used machine.  At the time I thought I'll give it a try and see if it works or not.  It worked amazingly well, I was thrilled with the results so I decided to keep it.  I cleaned and sanitized it completely and I felt it was 'safe' even though it was clearly a used product that I received.  The box had been opened and retaped, there was a bit of nail polish reside left on the little black flexible nail guard that you put your fingers in and the middle light that glows yellow was cracked.  I was just so gosh darn excited about getting this amazing item that I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a new one.  So it's partly my fault for not returning it.  Well after 5 months of use, it just stopped working.  No heat, no lights, nothing.  I'm crushed that it no longer works but I'm unwilling to purchase another one with the fear it will only last another 5 months.  I think the product and idea are fantastic and it worked great, but the quality control is sorely lacking.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br /><br />Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br /><br />This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.",[],B07SRW6NVK,B07SRW6NVK,AE6TDCUOKCSCRL5ZHWKEL7QHOA3A,1568211985513,5,False

So I don't have a clue what these are made of.<br /><br />They are not quite as soft as the ones that come with their own serum that I've tried.  But they are fairly sturdy.

3.0,Nice But of Limited Use for Us Old Ladies,"What this is not:  it is not a hormone replacement therapy, and you can't expect the same results as if it were.  It is, however, a nice collection of organic oils and beeswax which combines to make a semisolid much lighter in feel than petroleum jelly but not a liquid.  You need only a little dab - using too much could get messy.  It softens at body temperature but doesn't turn into an oily liquid.  It is quite nice and refreshing.  It's an odd greenish color.<br /><br />But the product is a bit confusing to me.  It is for external vaginal use only.  I don't know about you, but at what point is my vagina external instead of internal?  It seems pretty internal to me.  That makes it of limited use to postmenopausal women like me.

3.0,"Great brush, some drawbacks","Update:  I am lowering my rating to 3 stars because of the difficulty and expense of finding and buying replacement heads.  I couldn't find any for quite some time.  I've since found some online, not on Amazon, but from a low of $19.99 (but out of stock) to more than $25 for a single head.  The difficulty and cost makes buying this brush too impractical, which is too bad because I like the unit.<br />~~~~~~~<br /><br />The toothbrush I reviewed is the similar model, EW-DE92.  I was taken to this page when I tried to post my review.<br /><br />First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the ""white"" mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner's guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.<br /><br />I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use ""white"" most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don't use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn't feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.<br /><br />Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.<br /><br />The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.<br /><br />But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to ""Contact an authorized service center for repair.""  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.<br /><br />One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don't like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.<br /><br />While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don't believe the price difference is justified.",[],B00JMDPK8S,B00JMDPK8S,AE6TDCUOKCSCRL5ZHWKEL7QHOA3A,1404924947000,7,False

I do at home extensions, which is essentially me adhering the lashes to the bottom of my own lashes with a stronger glue. The shampoo wasn’t irritating to my eyes and it cleaned out the dust and little particles that get stuck in the lashes. They were fairly dirty when I tested it and it did a good job without affecting the glue and removing the lashes. One did fall out but I had been wearing the lashes for a while and they were overdue to be taken off and replaced. I tested how well it would clean the lashes after they were removed, and it didn’t do a good job removing the glue which I actually think is a good thing because it means it’s perfectly safe to use on your extensions and won’t cause them to fall off. Even though it didn’t remove much of the glue, the lashes were significantly cleaner and I think after some soaking in micellar water and another wash with the shampoo they will be good to reuse. It’s a great product to maintain your lashes and extend the time between applications, and to get a couple more uses out of the lashes if you do it yourself at home.",[],B0BFLNDCGH,B0BFLNDCGH,AE4WTL3UOZJS4JJZU6A54G4QV5SQ,1672452083361,0,False

4.0,This set is very nice for a starter set for someone that doesn't have ...,"I am a makeup junkie and have oodles and oodles of brushes. This set is very nice for a starter set for someone that doesn't have any brushes, it is WONDERFUL for a present. Anyone that would receive this would love it. The presentation is wonderful. The set comes in this dual sided book. The brushes are a wide variety of styles. I have used them for about a week now and have a pretty good idea of their performance. First they are pretty sturdy, so that is nice in your hand. They didn't shed when washed, and that is huge!!!! The face brushes are really nice and pick up product great and distribute it just as nice. The eyeliner brushes are nice also. There are several different sizes to get the type of line you want. The eyeshadow brushes I am on the fence with. First the hairs are not even on all of them, if you want to even it up you would need to pluck out the stray guy. The cut on the eye brushes are ok on some and not so much on others. They feel scratchy when trying to blend out your product. The other thing is that none of the brushes indicate the intended use. That is not a bad thing, but I think for someone getting into makeup, they may be overwhelmed  with the volume of the brushes and not know what to do with them.

Dimensions are slightly larger than I expected, and weight is also on the heavier than expected side.

4.0,I think they are on to something here.,"I have long, fine, wavy/frizzy hair. I can do most straightening with the dryer but I was wanting something that would give it that sleek shiny straight look without using product that makes my hair look greasy. I ordered this because i have tried everything else, why not this. Right out of the box i knew they were on to something here. A bit heavy, but nothing more than a hairdryer. I tried &#34;brushing&#34; my hair with it, bad idea. It yanked my hair out bad. The rubber bristles snag hair very easily. But if you piece out hair, like you do with a flat iron, and work slowly down the hair while firmly holding it taunt then you have something.

What remains of my sparse brows is dark and the two don't match but my brown hair has been colored a light-medium brown. I use the blonde and it comes out perfectly. I've tried easily 15 other products in recent years -- before discovering the mineral oil trick and returning to the Ardell Pomade and -- and none worked as well.

5.0,"This nifty, solidly built, silent, little tool is THE BOMB!","I am amused at what I let friends talk me into.  As an Aesthetic RN (Yeah, that's right, Botox, Fillers... painful Machines both large and small ;-) I fancy myself to have a healthy skepticism about the latest fads in health, beauty, and 'De-age-ification'. A girlfriend of mine REALLY wanted me to buy this Rose Quartz Roller. She gave me lots of reasons about lifting and tightening which fell on deaf ears. But then she mentioned Lymphatic Drainage. That got my attention. There is a snippet of good research to support lymphatic drainage as a valid de-age-ification tool. Not enough to get me to buy this thing. But, the research exists.<br /> The reason I bought the Rose Quartz Roller is because I have ALLERGIES. When I was a child in the Midwest, I was allergic to the month of June. Now, I live on the Left Coast and my “hayfever” is 365/24/7. I take daily antihistamines, I pop an additional Mucinex and 12 hour pseudoephedrine to clear out my head weekly. When it gets really bad, I end up on my back, on my bed, drugged up, hot steam going, and massaging my face to aid my lymphatic drainage. This process helps. I can usually get things cleared up enough to breath through my nose and get to sleep.<br /> NOW, I have this handy little tool. When I have a few extra moments in the morning or evening I quickly run it in counts of 10 strokes over my lymphatic pathways. I either work from the chin up or from my eyes up then my cheeks down. Always sweeping from the center outward, I was taught to work the pathways of the face all the way down the outside of the neck, to the clavicles. With this roller, it takes me very little time. I can feel the motion of all the annoying stuff in my sinuses as it clears. The small roller end is great for the eyes and upper face and the larger end simplifies the lower face and neck. The Rose Quartz Roller changes lymphatic massage from something I would take the time for when I absolutely had to do it, to a fun and easy once or twice a day part of my self care routine. This nifty, solidly built, silent, little tool is THE BOMB!<br /> Then bonus round...

So it will last me a year for the thirteen dollars I spent.  It's well worth it for the safety and cleanliness of putting things in your eyes.  I have been wearing contact lenses most of my life, and it is SUPER important not to get any germs or bacteria in your eyeballs, people.  I have had a couple of infections due to lack of care.

The soaps are so fragrant that I could smell them the second I opened the shipping box.  The blend of multiple scents was a little bit overwhelming, but individually, these are incredible!<br /><br />I can't pick a single favorite because they all smell so rich and lovely, but I'm rather partial to the Spiced Pumpkin, which I'm currently using in my bathroom.  The whole room smells like pumpkin and cinnamon when I lather up, like I said these are super fragrant.  The soap itself lathers nicely and has just the right amount of exfoliating texture when rubbing the bar over my skin.  My hands are left feeling quite soft and smell wonderful for much longer than they would with store-bought liquid soaps.  A lot of soaps are over-drying, but this one leaves my hands feeling soft rather than dry, my guess is that it's due to the shea butter formula.<br /><br />I'm very pleased, with these soaps.  I've stored them in the drawers of my dresser and my towel closet until I'm ready to use them at the sink because the fragrance is so powerful they make for a great drawer sachet too!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B5csppKgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B5csppKgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71B5csppKgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CuC-oQ9oL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CuC-oQ9oL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CuC-oQ9oL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MqhumqiyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MqhumqiyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MqhumqiyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2OEPXCBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2OEPXCBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2OEPXCBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B015QSOGC8,B015QSOGC8,AEP6LCQJINI522KTDFCQAGFNXSSQ,1476234622000,29,True

5.0,Works as advertised and better,"I have been using a Norelco T370 trimmer for several months.  I bought it for the mini-shaver initially, decided to grow a beard, then trimmed the beard with the beard trimmer attachment.  It did a great job of shaping and trimming, but left a mess of clippings in the sink.  After reading a million reviews, I decided to try the T980 for it's vacuum feature.<br /><br />The T980 is great!  It does a perfect job of trimming my beard evenly (setting at 7, ultimate beard length to be a 9).  The best part is that about 90% of the clippings go into the vacuum receptical with only about 10% being lost.  I have not come across any of the negatives (adjustment slips, tugs hairs and on and on) mentioned in other reviews.  Unlike my T370, this trimmer lets you know when it's fully charged or about to go dead, and even if it does die in the middle of a session from a dead battery, plugging it in finishes the job.  Most other trimmers only work when charged, not on house current.<br /><br />I can't think of anything this trimmer could do better.  In my estimation it's looks, design and operation are flawless.  The clipper works well on my beard's 'neckline' and the mini-trimmer keeps the bottom of my mustache trimmed perfectly.  I really think the T370 does as good a job trimming as this one does, but will not run with a dead battery when plugged in, and does make a mess with beard clippings all over the place.  For those two reasons alone, this trimmer is a BEST BUY!<br /><br />I am not putting the T370's abilities down in any way.  For the price it can't be beat.  It trims well and the mini-shaver is still the best way to shave the short hairs on my cheeks above my beard on a daily basis.  I use it daily along with the T980 and will continue to.  They both have their place.  If you don't mind the beard trimmings everywhere, you will be happy with the T370, however if you are serious about perfect beard grooming (and I DO mean PERFECT), with none of the mess, both tools are a must.",[],B000FEF1V4,B000FEF1V4,AGDC7ZZINCIWF33DHXNAR2KASB6A,1186004541000,2,True

5.0,Easier to handle . . .,"My Goody Heat Flash 1875 Watt hairdryer died . . . RIP.  So going through the various hairdryers on Amazon and Berta has 5-star ratings.  How could I go wrong?  Well it is smaller an lighter than my old Goody which actually makes it easier to handle.  I tried the highest heat setting which turns on the red light inside the dryer which I am assuming is the ionic part of it.  I started out on the medium setting and went to high to see how it would perform.  I normally always dry my hair at the medium/low setting (red light does not turn on at medium setting) and it didn't seem too loud to my ear and all in all I am pleased with the outcome and Berta.<br /><br />6/16/17 UPDATE:  I find the red light a bit annoying as I am drying my hair.  It is very bright and if I point towards my face and eyes, I need close my eyes.  I would think that the ionic ceramic feature could be achieved without the red light (this is a gimmick, for sure).  My Goody Heat flash had the same features (ionic, ceramic, tourmaline) and did not have any lights.  After continued use, I think my Goody was better at drying my hair faster at a lower setting.

4.0,It's good to be different.,"First, I got into ethique for the environmental benefits.  I looked at my cosmetics and face care collection and it just hit my how much waste I am producing in the name of vanity.  I also don't really have the time to sit down and make my own home brewed recipes either.  Stumbled across the Ethique brand and it was like aaaaaaaaahhhh.  One single use plastic down.  This is on par with what I pay for my other serums, if not actually a little cheaper.  I was able to try it in the sample pack - DO IT THERE FIRST!!  This sadly will not be a serum for everyone.  I have really, really, really dry skin.  Just genetics.  I also work outside and play outside year round so my skin is abused.  I need very heavy moisturizers.  If you have oily skin, or even mixed, this may not work for you, or it would be best used as a once a week quench.  It takes some tinkering to find out the right amount to put on.  I screwed it up the first two nights and over did it.  Plus, since I was used it with the lotion, my face was slippery it was like teflon.  As someone else said, a little goes a long, long way.  Be patient.  I pinch of the tiniest amounts and as soon as it hits my face it melts and is able to be spread around.  Pinch and repeat.<br /><br />I think this is the bees knees personally and will be using this.  I love how it travels.  I love I don't have to feel like a froufrou girl when I go into the backcountry with a serum.  Someone could certainly ask why I have so much soap... but whatever.  I hope they take another stab at this and make a lighter version for the girls that don't need to soak their faces.  Again, try the sample pack.  You get this, three facial soaps, and the lotion at a very fair price to try before you commit to the full size.  So if you hate it, you are still bound to find something you love.  And if you hate it and chuck, at least it's not another plastic bottle.",[],B0769YSRJR,B0769YSRJR,AEEA5FAZ7QGCQSOG62BEKEUUEHCQ,1557339520762,2,False

4.0,This stuff actually works!,"I had a pretty ugly blackhead on my nose. For weeks I tried everything to get rid of it. I even asked my girlfriend for some beauty tips. Nothing worked. After awhile I noticed it getting bigger so I became desperate. I did something most guys would ever do... I visited a beauty salon that specializes in skin care. Fortunately for me, the lady I spoke to didn't want to take my money and told me to just pick up a bottle of Vi-Tae Blackhead remover. She told me all this mombo jumbo about why and how it works and I pretended like I understood but it all flew over my head. I went home later that night and found it on Amazon. Honestly, I didn't want to spend $30+ dollars on a health and beauty product because, well, I'm a guy. But I took the lady's advice and went with it. Like Prime normally does, I got it in two days. I followed the directions - apply every morning to damp skin, let it sit for a few minutes and rinse. I have to be honest... I didn't see any difference after the first day. The blackhead was still there. I did it again the second day. Nothing. Third day. Zilch. Fourth day. Nada. I was becoming impatient and felt ripped off. However, after I applied it on the fifth day, the blackhead was gone after I rinsed it! I was like WHOA! This girly stuff really works. Before I start to rave about this stuff, I have to say that it didn't get it all out. If I look close enough, I can still see a tiny spec left in my pore. But I'll just continue using this stuff and see what happens. In all honesty, no one else can see it anymore. But my girlfriend said to continue keeping it clean so it doesn't come back.<br /><br />FYI, I'm a 31 year old Asian male with pretty oily skin.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Actually works but it can take up to a week to remove a large blackhead<br />- Smells good and refreshing<br />- Directions are easy to follow<br /><br />CONS:<br />- This stuff will sting the first few times you use it.

3.0,I love these!,"Update: this is my second time buying these braids, and as much as I love how easy they are to install, goodness do they shed. Instantly, tons of shedding from the ends all the way up. When I trim off loose pieces, very carefully, it seems to create a million more. I sleep with them in a satin scarf and don't mess with them very much, they just have a frizzy life of their own. As much as I love the color, I'm going to try a different color and maybe a different brand in the future.<br /><br />This was my first time self-installing braids already braided; as a mixed Afro-Indigenous person who didn't grow up having my hair braided and has struggled to find a method of doing it that won't give me a migraine for days (last time 😬), these were such a gift.<br /><br />Super easy install; it still took several hours, but I'm new to this so I expected that. My 2C-3B  hair is very short and fine, (see photo), so I did a mixture of rubber bands and tiny braids to crochet into, with Murray's edgewax to separate and Got To Be Ultra Glued to hold it. (Thank you many YouTube tutorials!)<br /><br />I've had so many compliments on them, and a lot of surprise when I share they were pre-braided and self-intalled. Compared to my last  braids, these are lightweight and soft, although the blonder ends are a bit rough. I did an Apple Cider Vin + warm water soak, gentle shampoo, and a deep conditioner + warm water soak, followed by a very thorough rinse. Then I hung them to dry from their gold bands for several days before I installed them. I still have two packs left over, and have a big head! 🙌🏽<br /><br />I'm honestly so happy with them, and glad I did them myself. One day I would really love to have my hair braided professionally, but this is an amazing option for myself!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MXlkPsy+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MXlkPsy+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MXlkPsy+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gdHc1U0GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gdHc1U0GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gdHc1U0GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71snDd-ap8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71snDd-ap8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71snDd-ap8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bfcuyUmEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bfcuyUmEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bfcuyUmEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G54WR6Z,B09W1WXMRC,AE3MTENHIRHLMGZSMWJA3DNJV3UA,1648647111910,0,True

When you open it its a disgusting mess of gooey water mixed with metal etc. You can clean this out and replace the batteries and it MIGHT work again. In my experience it does not work and if it does it dies after a while. The hatch at the bottom always comes off and does not stay in place which is what leads to it getting water inside.<br />I am finally fed up with it and now that I think of it having paid for 4 of these (beginning from when they were much pricier than now) I have paid well over $100 for these, when I could have just bought the more expensive, rechargeable (MUCH battery for the environment too), and overall better toothbrushes they have.

5.0,"High performing, easy to use, removes hair leaving skin soft and smooth","This is a high performing waxing kit and a great option to have handy at home for touchups and to keep my skin fuzz free, and my eyebrows from becoming a unibrow. I love having my brows professionally shaped and facial hair removed at my favorite salon, but this wonderful kit has made it easier to maintain the cosmetic improvements<br />in between appointments. This kit comes with four varieties of wax beans infused with all natural extractions and oils, like chamomile, lavender, aloe, and honey, making this wax gentle enough to use on even the most sensitive skin. The kit, which requires heating up the wax before applying to the skin, has a warming pot with an adjustable heat setting to melt the beans quickly without getting it hot enough to  burn the skin, and an auto-shutoff to prevent overheating. I really like the see through lid to be able to watch the melting. The wax is very effective at removing both stubborn, course hair, and fine thinner hairs, getting  the hair follicles at the root, leaving my skin soft and smooth longer, with no irritation. Another feature I really like is the warming pot is detachable from the base for easy cleaning.

5.0,Loving These Locs!,"[[VIDEOID:f6fe2bb4d18d1094a8c2136bc198cd5a]] I've always loved dreads, so when I saw these, I ordered them immediately! I hadn't known I could simply *install* dreads without having to grow my own hair long and then proceed to do whatever magic (and damage) was necessary to create dreads. As soon the first set of 12 arrived, I was thrilled; I also knew that 12 strands was nowhere near enough to cover my head so I ordered a second set. Each set came with a bag of random hair accessories as well as what looks similar to a crochet hook. The hook is ridiculously small, so I don't know if it's intended to pull the hair through the top loop or if it's to help maintain the dreads as they're washed and loosen up over time. There were no instructions, so after my first set arrived I scoured the Internet to find photos of loc styles as well as tutorials about how to install them. I've included a short video with this review to help people realize that the most difficult part will be installing these on the back of your head. (I don't have a fold-out mirror and I don't trust myself to do a good job, so I've got to find someone I trust to do the back of my head for me.)<br /><br />While this is the first set of dreads I've handled, they're not stiff and they have no odor. (While researching dreads, I discovered that a lot of synthetic pieces have those issues but THESE do not! I mean, I loved the first set so much that I ordered another right away.) I don't plan to have my entire head in dreads, but if I did I could easily get away with only 3 to 4 sets (with leftovers) because my hair is really thin and I'd pull larger sections through the top loop as I braided each piece in.<br /><br />The ends of the dreads look a little scraggly BUT I think that makes them look all the more authentic; in fact, I was surprised when I hopped back online and saw these are synthetic! The top of each has a black rubber band just below a loop of hair and you basically pull a section of your own hair through that top loop, split that hair into two sections (so with the dread and your own hair you have three separate sections). Get the dread close to your scalp, then simply braid the three sections together to secure the loc into place. You'll need a small rubber band to hold the sections together where they end and it's that simple! You can attach the little hair accessories wherever you choose.<br /><br />If you've been wanting locs, these are an excellent value and the perfect way to see if the look is right for you. I do think they should come with instructions, but that doesn't take away from the perfect coloring, length, and texture!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610eKXtYMmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610eKXtYMmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610eKXtYMmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj9H67rbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj9H67rbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj9H67rbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RmT4m6EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RmT4m6EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RmT4m6EL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GAqYc8KwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GAqYc8KwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GAqYc8KwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HxE8BPtOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HxE8BPtOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HxE8BPtOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fl6SpE6kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fl6SpE6kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fl6SpE6kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9eaicENL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9eaicENL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9eaicENL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B7DZ4YV7,B0B7DZ4YV7,AFSAZEU3CXTOZCFVHEKOQFZ7O43Q,1678017960408,1,True
3.0,Playful and Pricey: Check Ingredients,"This is my first experience using a gel-to-oil cream so I didn't know what to expect, though I hoped it'd leave my skin radiant and glowing (due to the words ""GLOW DAY CREAM"" in the name). *Note: There's no glow whatsoever.<br /><br />When I dip into a little bit of product, it's a shiny lightweight, non-sticky pink gel. As soon as I apply it to my face or to the top of my hand, it melts, spreads with ease, and leaves my skin velvety soft. The absorption rate is fairly quick compared to similar creams and oils, though usually if something is immediately devoured by my skin, there's no evidence it was there; this, however, leaves my skin smooth and without a greasy residue. It can easily be applied prior to makeup if needed. Finally, this gel has a nice medium fragrance that isn't overpowering or lingering.<br /><br />While I do like the heavy glass jar and think it looks nice, it's quite deceiving. With only one ounce of product inside, I have another jar of face cream that's the same size but contains twice the product. And when compared to other options, ingredients are crucial. (I've included a photo from the box.) While I recognize some as being good organic extracts and oils, the majority sound like chemical compounds I've never heard of.<br /><br />Being a mere breath away from 50, I need to factor in sun damage, a depletion of hormones, thinning skin, melanin spots, and overall aging when I decide what's best for my skincare. This product, while moisturizing, simply doesn't make the cut as something I'll order again.<br /><br />CONS STACKED UP:<br />- Only 1 oz of product<br />- Unfamiliar ingredients<br />- Lacking ingredients I look for based on skincare needs<br />- High price-point<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Leaves skin velvety soft<br />- Nice scent<br />- Absorbs well, no icky residue","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51--+pYZbKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51--+pYZbKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51--+pYZbKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mYp0xl06L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mYp0xl06L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mYp0xl06L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edPXBKnTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edPXBKnTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61edPXBKnTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibOUye6ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibOUye6ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibOUye6ZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B1M7JRHY,B0B1M7JRHY,AFSAZEU3CXTOZCFVHEKOQFZ7O43Q,1662613862447,0,False
2.0,Messy Bun Mess,"This messy bun is made from synthetic hair and comes with 2 black nylon-like stretchy bands and 10 black bobby pins. Right out of the package, the messy bun was true to its name. It was a mess! It took awhile to find the tousled strands (which I've included a close-up shot of one where it's held into its tousle with a tiny clear rubberband). I sorted through the bun and pulled all of the longer parts through one end so they might hang better for a natural look.<br /><br />I wear my hair in messy buns a lot, but I just can't get this hairpiece to look good on my head. I believe that the color does play a small role in my dissatisfaction, as the top of my hair is much more blonde BUT the underside of my natural hair that I pull up IS much darker and matches the shade of the brown tones much better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the entire design of the bun just doesn't work well on my thin hair. The photos I've shared are of it secured around a bun of my hair with a few bobby pins. I think this piece might work better for people who have thicker hair. I also suggest trying to match the top layer of hair rather than the underside that you pull up if your hair is darker underneath like mine.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nuSXzh0cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nuSXzh0cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nuSXzh0cL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714P-1VtAEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714P-1VtAEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714P-1VtAEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717yYnjyCsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717yYnjyCsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717yYnjyCsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m+9GUitHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m+9GUitHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m+9GUitHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B45YFNGN,B0B45YFNGN,AFSAZEU3CXTOZCFVHEKOQFZ7O43Q,1659938921639,0,False

3.0,Not too happy with it,"I have heard so many mixed reviews on mud masks and decided to give it a try. I am not into the beauty scene, but I have been looking for something to help me with my facial skin problems. I suffer from dry skin after showering, and then overnight it gets so oily I look as if I put oil all over my face. Of course I shower, and the process repeats itself.<br /><br />When I first got this product, I was unsure exactly how much to use of it. So I just used a little, barely touching anything. Then the next application I used more, probably more than needed, but again, I have never done this before.<br /><br />The texture was weird, and when i shook it around in the container it was like rubber. It even felt rubbery. Not sure if this was just my container, or if all of them are like this way. The smell wasn’t too bad, smelled kind of like.. well dirt, which I would expect to be honest. The directions were easy to follow, and it didn’t leave an oily residue on my skin, but it did feel a little dry.<br /><br />I used this product for a little over a week, I always like to give things proper time for trial. I don’t judge on one day. but after a week it should have worked right?<br /><br />Wrong, my dry skin was so severe that I not only had dry skin on my forehead, but on my nose and chin too. I am pretty disappointed, but then again, every person and body is different. While it worked for other reviewers, it didn’t work for me. I will give them a 3 star because their customer service and prompt shipping is amazing, and their other products that I have tried are great too!

5.0,Great for Bleached/Dyed damaged hair,"I bleach and dye my hair more often than I should (I get bored so quickly with hairstyles), so my hair is always dried out and frizzy, but if I go more than a day without showering then it turns greasy and looks like I haven't showered for weeks!<br /><br />I have heard so many good reviews about this shampoo so I decided I would give it a try. I just recently bleached my hair again, but with a new bleach I have never used before. My hair got super dry and stiff. Even the nourishing shampoo and conditioner that was included in the kit didn't help. After a couple days I paired this with a Argan Oil Hair Mask (kind of like a stay in conditioner).

I would not recommend for darker or olive skin as it would be too light. I like that the compact is small and doesn't have too much extra packaging taking up valuable real estate in my make-up box. You do have to use your own brush (I use my standard blush brush) as it does not come with one. There is a mirror inside. It has a faint light maple scent to it which does not bother me. I've been using it for about two weeks and have not had any adverse skin reactions (I have sensitive skin). I love Urban Decay products as they are modern, on trend and quality.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y6s5XxSyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y6s5XxSyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Y6s5XxSyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-6NY-56L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-6NY-56L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-6NY-56L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515GRSCApEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515GRSCApEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515GRSCApEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01GTD0REU,B01GTD0REU,AF24V4EGK5AQLAOJWHGV4FKKXTMQ,1472597271000,3,False

4.0,Too long but cute,So I got this product in last week and I’m just putting it on today. I had my daughter to ease it out and fix the part. I tried it on and it’s just way too long. It’s very reminiscent of Cher in the 80s.  But not as fabulous. The hair is very irritating and there’s a lot of flyaways. There was also a patch of hair that was cut extremely short and it will not lie down. So what I did was I gave the wig a trim and I think it looks much better than the long week that I received. There’s a photo of how it looks now. And I’m really liking it a lot.<br /><br />Disclaimer<br />I used a coupon to get a percentage off of this purchase.

5.0,... everything I need to keep my nails looking very nice. I keep my nails kind of low so ...,This manicure set has everything I need to keep my nails looking very nice.

Because that's how often I do my toes. It even has the nail clipper this kind of bent to the side so you can get down the sides of your feet easier. I absolutely love it because I have an ingrown toenail in that particular nail clipper makes it easy to trim around it and make sure I don't hurt anything.

5.0,A great shampoo!,This shampoo and conditioner say it says it is for people with curly hair. Well I am an African-American natural haired woman and my hair is supremely curly. My hair is really thick and not many shampoos and conditioners work the way that I want them to. So I go through Raton. I tried this shampoo and a clean my hair very very well and it didn't strip it of the natural oils that are already present in my hair.  It smells really great as well. Then I condition my hair with the conditioner that came with it and it made my curls so soft and it gave them a little bit of shine. This did everything then I expected it to and wanted it to. So I was not disappointed in the results. I'm going to try this on my daughters hair as well because they somehow misplaced all of their hair supplies. Her hair is much different than mine because she wears dreadlocks so hopefully this'll work just great and her hair as It did in mine.

5.0,quality set with carrying pouch!,"I am constantly misplacing my tweezers and am always buying new ones. Some are better than others. I will say that I am very happy about this set. My last pair of angled tweezers actually cut my eyebrow hairs instead of plucking them, which drove me crazy. I am happy to say the slanted pair in this set does not do that - thankfully! I was able to easily pluck my eyebrow hairs to perfection. I am not a person that is ever precise enough to use the pointed tweezers, but since they came in this set, I put them to use in a different way. I am using them to weed my vinyl designs after I cut them. They are precise and working out nicely. I also tried the flat pair, which work fine, but I really prefer the slanted overall for my uses. These come in a sparkly purple case. The tweezers are color coded with a shimmery glittery finish. Honestly, I think the color design is a bit pre-teen-like, but they are tweezers and they work, so I am not too picky about the colors. Overall, nice quality set!

5.0,a SAFE hairgel for kids and adults that works!,"My son has super fine hair. I finally found a hairstyle that looks great on him, but I can’t seem to find a gel that really stays all day. He is a toddler and VERY active. I typically have to put hair gel in his hair to style it 2-3 times a day. I was tired of spending money on gel that was not meeting my expectations. Since I am using it on my toddler, I was very happy to find that this hair gel not only WORKS, but it is safe and does not contain any harmful chemicals. Even after being in his hair all day long, it did not have any flakes or residue. There is not much of an odor which is good. I do wish it was in a squeeze bottle, as I just find that easier to use and store! Overall, nice product. I like that it came with a safety seal as well.

5.0,Cute bob UPDATED!,"This hair is very soft!  True to length, no shedding at all.  I am going to tone the color as I prefer an Ashe blonde with dark roots but I can tell it will take color well.  I flat ironed it after these pics were taken and it handled the heat nicely.  No damage.  I recommend and the seller is very nice.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/21/21<br />Wanted to update a/new pics since I dyed this unit and played around with it some more.  It took color extremely well.  Watch your time though-  I only processed for about 7 minutes each section.  I did a darker smudge root and 4 different colors mixed on the rest (looks more real than one solid all over color & adds dimension).  It’s so perfect.  Did not damage, still soft and when I tell you she has not shed nor broken off on me please hear me because I speak the truth!  Not even a little bit.  I was unsure of what her style would be since she ended Up in an odd shape with shipping.  But she dries to a nice scrunch wave I let her air dry n no products in these pics n you can see in the one picture I straightened one piece and it straightens beautifully with no snapping or breaking.  Lastly-  this hairline is so good n this is the first time EVER I’ve encountered legit transparent lace.  I’m sort of olive toned so lace always shows on me and I have to cut every bit off cuz it does not melt on me ever. Look at my pics-  notice I left some lace?? Yea.  She melts.  Completely.  Baby hairs are perfect & I did no plucking or bleaching knots whatsoever.  Oh yea- I have an enormous head and she fits.  Might even have a lil extra room.

Also, it doesn't feel like there is much liquid in the tube. It always feels like I am at the end of the tube and I often feel the need to stop and shake it in the middle of application because it starts out thicker and then gets lighter by the time I get across the other side of my eye lid and then sometimes it doesn't look like a consistent line and has to be touched up.",[],B00853F6ZS,B00853F6ZS,AHWKHVFVMJ44PSPGDCFKOQCJNIBA,1456630658000,0,False

5.0,My thoughts on the Silicon Devices 150 Watt Inverter,"The Silicon Devices 150 Watt Power Inverter allows you to power up all of your devices when you're on the road. This can be especially useful if you have a family and they have brought a lot of different devices with them for the trip and you want to make sure that they can always keep them charged up. The inverter is small and compact but still manages to provide you with enough power to be able to charge up most devices such as a laptop, as well as mobile devices like phones and tablets. You'll find that it has one AC outlet that lets you plug in any standard device that isn't powered by USB, such as a laptop. It also have two USB ports that can be used to power up your mobile devices. One of the USB ports has an output of 2.1 Amps, while the other is 1.0 Amps. Both of these are fast enough to charge most phones and tablets, however if you want to get the fastest charge then I would recommend using the 2.1 Amp port for tablets and phones with larger batteries and save the lower 1.0 Amp port for devices that require less power to charge.<br /><br />I have tested this out in my vehicle and I like how small and compact this thing is compared to our old inverter. It is about half of the size and still manages to have the same 150 Watt rating. I have also tried to plug in a standard USB charging hub to the AC port to test out the charge speed with more devices connected to it and that worked out great. If you have a lot more devices then those two ports can charge, then I would highly recommend picking up a hub to go with this thing. I did receive this to test out and provide feedback on but my review is honest and I do like this having this inverter in my vehicle for trips.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKzuCfMlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKzuCfMlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tKzuCfMlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vmbze9a3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vmbze9a3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vmbze9a3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01AJ4A4CA,B01AJ4A4CA,AGLL2LGMWCNPBBMHVNYXQ3PCREFQ,1458050812000,0,False
5.0,"Unique, high quality, and non-toxic tattoos","I chose to get the style #2 pack of temporary tattoos. This comes with 5 seperate sheets of tattoo's, and each tatoo is unique in it's own way. The tattoos are all FDA approved as non-toxic and as such can be used anywhere on your skin without any worries. This is something to keep in mind if you look for any product that goes on your skin. The tattoos are all supposedly inspired by what celebrities have, however there is none that I can recognize, but I'm sure they are correct. To apply the tattoo of your choice, just look for the one you want, cut it out from one of the sheets, peel off the clear plastic and then place it face down on the body part where you want the tattoo. Next, use a washcloth that is wet and place it over the tattoo for 20-30 seconds and you can now peel back the paper and you will notice that it has transferred perfectly. I've tried a lot of the ones I received and they all went on without any issues or with any only partially transferring like I've experienced with other temporary tattoos in the past. The tattoos are unique, high quality, non-toxic and they come with a 30 day money back guarantee with no questions asked. Just tell them you want your money back, and they'll refund you which means there is no risk to buying these awesome tattoos!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my review.

I am not new to hair removal creams, and I can say with certainty, this one was the worst I’ve dealt with. First, the reviewers saying this stuff smells nice are either out of their minds, have no sense of smell, or they’re lying. It was no better than Nair or Veet. The bottle is way too tiny, and being plus-sized, I used up the entire thing in one use. The spatula/scraper they provide you with is microscopic compared to some. It took for-ev-er to get all the cream off with that thing. Near the end, I just gave up and rinsed some of it off without scraping. And you can’t use most body washes after this? What’s up with that? I usually like to do my hair removal creams before a shower, and I can’t soap my legs?! And the hair inhibitor part did not absorb easily. Needless to say, I won’t purchase this again.",[],B08P4KS91J,B08P4KS91J,AE747BFOMZ3GIYS5ZJS426EKBZ3A,1621889817285,1,True

It took her be there in 10 minutes to comb out, and didn't take more than a few little strands with it!! I usually end up losing a handful every morning!!

The only brushes i cannot fit in the holder are my kabuki brushes (these brushes are very short but thick barrel.

4.0,A good human hair wig!,"613-20”-bangs<br /><br />I would buy this again! It came in a bag, tangle free and had a slight smell to it. Bangs are long enough to be cut to desired length. In both pictures they are uncut.<br /><br />The first picture is it straight out of the bag, only styling the bangs with a flat iron. The second picture is after a color bath and styling.<br /><br />THE ENDS TAKE COLOR QUICKLY! I dipped mine in a purple shampoo bath, leaving the ends out (only allowing the water to touch it when squeezing the water out) and they still took more color than the top of the wig, along with the bangs. Holds styling well, went all day without losing curls even in the snow.<br /><br />I would say it’s all human hair, I don’t see any plastic hairs or had any melting when styling.<br /><br />The wig is 20” from top to bottom, though I was expecting the hair to be 20”. It’s a comfortable stretchy mesh cap, and fits my larger head snuggly. My head is about 23” around, so heads 22”-24” should be fine wearing this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814orKN2qRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814orKN2qRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814orKN2qRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919lt7zPG+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919lt7zPG+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/919lt7zPG+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08GSKWT3P,B08GSKWT3P,AE5PER3OFHDJWFUD7FKMCNGGVX5A,1607023450183,0,True

I am a caucasian female early 20's with lightened hair.I have been losing a lot of hair due to damage and stress. I was hoping this would help me grow my hair out longer and make it thicker. When I tried putting it on my roots and hair when damp, it made my hair look greasy. This has prevented me from really trying it because I shower at night and don't want to wake up the next morning and have greasy looking hair all day. When I did use it as a hot oil treatment though, my hair looked healthier afterwards. The one thing that I love the most about this product is that a little goes a long way and that it smells divine. The scent is just intoxicating. I am in the process of trying it as an overnight treatment under a shower cap along with coconut oil and will see how that helps.

4.0,Smell amazing,I was kind of bummed when we sold our house and the new place didn’t have a jacuzzi tub. I loved my baths with soothing bath bombs. So I started scouring the internet for a solution and found these shower bombs! They smell so good... EVERY scent. My almost 2 year old loves grabbing one every time we shower (she now expects one lol.) They fizz up if directly under the water or very slowly melt if not directly in water. The first one we used I followed the directions and kept it out of the direct water. This bomb lasted at least 3 15 minute showers so a good 45 minutes. This brings me to my only complaint. They are very fragrant but for some reason when in the shower out of the direct water I couldn’t really smell it. Our shower is fairly big along with our bathroom and we only have a shower curtain on it. I’m guessing the smell would be more powerful in a smaller bathroom. After the first shower not smelling as powerful as I would like I tried playing with the bomb. I put it directly in the shower (lasted about 15 minutes.) Tried close to the water but not directly in it. None of these really helped with the power of the scent. For the price and the fact that they last so long I will be reordering them as we are almost out and the toddler will be upset if she doesn’t have her shower bomb. We do put them right over the drain now which does seem to help a little with the smell.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7116t-PEbHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7116t-PEbHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7116t-PEbHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZgwDTcyuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZgwDTcyuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZgwDTcyuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e9fERAaUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e9fERAaUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e9fERAaUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hVr9vsNjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hVr9vsNjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hVr9vsNjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hWQ5E23XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hWQ5E23XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hWQ5E23XL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xBdEHQ0wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xBdEHQ0wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xBdEHQ0wL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07M6QNHT4,B07M6QNHT4,AG52M4KGSVD45QIZUAEBJXGU6W2Q,1550089879241,5,True

4.0,"Beautiful color and curls, but hairline not a natural appearance","I've been a topper wearer for several years and wanted to go with a full wig for a special occasion.  Right out of the package, I was impressed with the beauty of this wig.  The Ombre coloring is very attractive, and the curls are simply gorgeous.  The only problem that I had was that the hairline just doesn't promote a natural appearance.  I tried to blend the hairline with my own hair, but nothing I seemed to do made this look even remotely natural.  I think this is a very nice wig, but I will probably only be able to wear this using a headband or scarf until or unless I can figure out how to make the hairline more natural appearing.<br />Pros:<br />+The cap has a nice weft with breathable layers.  It is adjustable with nice combs to help secure the wig.  While I wore it, the wig felt secure without being tight.<br />+The synthetic hair is a decent quality with beautiful curls that really only required finger-combing to make them look very nice.  I saw no fraying or damage to the ends.<br />+This wig laid nicely on my shoulders and made me feel very attractive outside of the issue with the hairline.<br />Cons:<br />-As I've mentioned, the hairline doesn't really allow a very natural appearance.  Even if I were to think the hairline, I just don't see this appearing natural.  It could really use a lace front.<br />-I'm used to relatively lightweight toppers.  The density and length of the hair made this much heavier than I was used to.

4.0,More Vanilla than Tobacco.,"Disclaimer: I'm the spouse of the man using this product. I was excited to buy this for him since I adore the smell of tobacco leaf. If you're not experienced with what that smell is, don't think ""cigarettes"" or smoke when you see this term used; Tobacco is a subtly sweet and warm, earthy scent. It's a nice beard oil -- absorbs quickly and leaves his beard far more supple than if he forgot to apply any oil. (Which he does often enough that I need to remind him. *cough*) I'm a big fan of most scents deemed ""masculine"" or earthy: like tobacco, patchouli, oak, cedar, leather, pine, etc. Unfortunately, I'm finding the vanilla note in this to be far too heavy and overwhelms the tobacco -- so keep that in mind if you're buying this for the tobacco scent. So, although I'd really give it a solid 3.5 stars, I'm feeling generous since it seems like a nice oil blend despite the overly sweet vanilla scent. In hindsight, I wish I'd gone for the Tobacco Patchouli version of this!",[],B07NVXN1BW,B07NVXN1BW,AEEZDE4JC6J626HAIDSJD75DKWUQ,1566405134704,2,True

It smells fresh and clean- nothing like other colors I've used.  The end result is soft, shiny hair and the color lasts longer the other colors I've tried too.

1.0,"meh, not finish you expect from 'medium hold cream'","Performance is just in-between and marginal. You put normal amount, you get slight sheen and not much hold at all... so then you put a bit more, you get lots more sheen and then it solidifies hair like you put crappy gel... other 'cream' products won't give you gel-like solidification. Just a bit more hold. Btw the smell of the whole esquire men's hair products are annoying but you can quickly reduce it by opening the lid for a day.",[],B079TGGJ1Y,B079TGGJ1Y,AHEPKZHRE6AW4YYFBW3EQADXE5MQ,1562217162832,0,True

1.0,Last stick purchased was hard as a rock and unusable,"This stinks, literally. I have purchased this deodorant stick 5 or 6 times on the past and am a huge fan, but something changed with the formula. I bought another stick at the same time from a different, non Amazon seller and had the same issue, so this is clearly a brand issue. Anyway, in the past I have been able to push the stick up in the carton and had a smooth application, but this stick was hard as a rock and would not move, even after trying to warm it up. I have since gone back to the jar as opposed to the stick, which is just as good as always.",[],B01L2A361G,B01L2A361G,AFAND5D45DCIVSWLUCV7NZ4FESJA,1543295781907,3,True

5.0,Best. Foundation. Ever.,"This is the lightest, most long-wearing foundation I've ever used. Period. And with mature (52) skin which tends to be dry, I'm not left with unsightly creases at the end of the day either. I use the Aeroblend airbrush to apply this in the morning and it looks great literally all day long! Despite having sensitive skin, this makeup has not caused a single breakout to date. It also doesn't feel like I'm wearing a mask - goes on light and stays that way. Highly recommend.",[],B00PEXDZ7I,B079JPNPF3,AGQQT7EDMF2QL2UZ3SIM5ZE5QZNQ,1484065528000,3,True
