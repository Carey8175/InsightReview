3.0,"A good shave, but the price isn't quite right.","I have had a cool skin razor for several years and always liked it. I finally got around to replacing the heads, and the difference in shave quality was dramatic (my old blades were at least 5 years old).  However, I only give this product three stars because the blade kit is expensive to replace yearly as recommended and only includes new blades, not an entire new blade assembly. I didn't expect this, but for $30 it would have been nice, especially since, as other reviewers have pointed out, the blades and assembly have a tendency to accumulate residue, particularly if you don't use the special Nivea shave cartridges.

I can't say much for how they do with hair, but I can say, if they can handle the abuse that I put them through to get the inside of a hole in a boat coated with sealant, they should hold up just fine for hair!<br /><br />Great product, highly recommended, no matter what you need them for!",[],B000WBQQY6,B00NFX6FJO,AFK6Z4AW7CDH3IHSRAABCGTQYH6Q,1653415016393,6,True

1.0,Reviews are Right - It Doesn't Brush :/,"I saw the reviews that said it doesn't do anything, but I was hoping it was more subjective and maybe it might work for me. Nope, it really doesn't brush anything.<br /><br />- Bristles are weak, arrived bent<br />-Maaaaybe could work if you have super thin hair<br />- Thin and flimsy feeling if that's a concern<br /><br />I use ""wet"" hairbrushes that are designed like this, and I have to say that the quality really varies. I have a couple that I love and work wonderfully--brushes tangled wet hair painlessly, evenly brushes hair to tie it up. I've only tried 4 brands, but this is the worst I've seen. The bristles are weak--they're really thin, even for wet brushes, and they arrived bent (not because it was used--it was in the plastic wrap and everything). I do have thick hair, but this is the first brush I've used (of ANY kind--tiny travel ones included) that feels like it's literally going on top of my hair and not through it at all, even when I try to press down. It maaay work if you have thin hair, but I mean really thin hair, and even them I'm doubtful.<br /><br />I bought this hoping I could use it as a travel brush, so I wasn't too picky as long as it brushed relatively okay. Obviously not, but the plastic is also lighter and thinner than I expected it to be, again, even for a small travel brush, so I'm doubtful it or the hinge wouldn't break easily with pressure while trying to brush thick or tangly hair.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31lXi3hXlUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31lXi3hXlUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31lXi3hXlUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09H5C47FJ,B09H5DWQD7,AGJG3LBIXZZAZHYUHV5GBM2YBGMQ,1673464787352,1,True

4.0,Works Great with Dark Hair,"I’ve always had natural hair color because I’m super scared of frying my hair and losing my length and natural color. I wasn’t expecting much from this product - everyone knows when you have dark hair, color just doesn’t show in it.<br /><br />So far, I’ve used the silver and the green. For the silver, I went all the way up in my hair, and for the green, I kept the top third of my hair undone. The color shows remarkably well in my hair! It can be brushed once the wax dries for a softer, less stringy look, but you do lose some of the color.<br /><br />I definitely don’t recommend wearing white when you have this wax in your hair, the white collar on my jacket went bright green. Also, be prepared that this is going to flake off all throughout the day. If you have shorter hair, it might not be as noticeable, but when your hair goes past your hips, you will get flakes all over your clothes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product to temporarily change your hair color without having to bleach your hair first.

No, but it’s definitely noticeable, easy to do, and a lot of fun!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NABpykPBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NABpykPBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NABpykPBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vp9eiTMcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vp9eiTMcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vp9eiTMcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sr+zR+R3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sr+zR+R3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sr+zR+R3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wuC918cxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wuC918cxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wuC918cxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B075RN7LTC,B075RN7LTC,AG5BLZUU74I74UXEQO4MLWEU7L2A,1523246046103,7,True

These wipes make my hands feel softer, but don't help dryness not much.  They are refreshing, but I still want to put hand lotion on after using one of these wipes.<br /><br />The price point of these wipes is high, which is why I don't recommend them for everyday use.

The only one this diffuser worked with was the Conair.  Unless you have a BIO IONIC dryer you run the risk that this item will not fit your dryer.<br /><br />When I finally found a dryer that worked with this diffuser, the diffuser worked well.  This diffuser is very well made compared to the diffusers that come with most dryers.  First, it's larger than typical diffusers.  Second, it swivels to open and close the air vents.  I find that it's best used when my hair is nearly dry to put the finishing touches on.  I was a bit skeptical of what a diffuser would offer at this price point, but I think the build quality warrants the price.<br /><br />Overall, I proceed with caution when ordering this product unless you have the BIO IONIC.

5.0,Pretty amazing...,"I've been using this razor since it arrived, approximately 2 weeks ago, and thinking long and hard about the score I'd give it.  I actually intended to give it 4/5, the reason being that, while it's an excellent razor, the price point is rather high.  In the end, though, I'm so impressed that I really need to give it a full five stars in spite of the price, with the caveat that you may want to take a look at one of the less expensive, stripped-down models; this one is the flagship, but all the models should be similarly excellent (please bear in mind this is the only one I've used).<br /><br />And excellent it is.  While my feelings have already been summed up in the opening paragraph, read on for similarly styled (but moderate) hyperbole.<br /><br />I've never gotten such a good shave with an electric razor.  Norelco does recommend that you give the razor a full 21 days of your time exclusively (i.e. not shaving with anything else) before making a judgment.  I haven't had the luxury of giving it a full 21 days, as I need to get my review in; however, I've already adjusted to it so well that I can't imagine going back to my old razors.  It will only get better as I get more used to it, although I'm perfectly satisfied at this point and unsure if it could get any better.<br /><br />Not only do I use it to shave my face (which is obviously what it was designed for, and it does a great job), I use it to shave my head.  It's not going to give you as close a shave as a traditional razor, but it's also not going to scrape against your skin like a traditional razor.  You'll also save money on shaving cream (the only extra expense is buying a new razor ""head"" for it yearly, the price of which I am uninformed of).  It works ""dry"".  This is nice for me, as it takes a lot of cream to shave both my face and my scalp, and it does, in fact, do a decent job on my head.  It's a little stubbly, even right after shaving, but honestly the only thing that would do a better job would be a blade, and that's a difficult way to shave (I was previously using a Headblade).  If it can shave a head, where my hair was very thick, I imagine it would be adequate for even the bushiest of beards, and, again, it's designed for faces, not heads.<br /><br />If you look at the features list, you'll see that this model is full of bells and whistles.  Truthfully, they are mostly extras you could live without; the lower-end models would likely be just fine, so I strongly suggest examining them as a money-saving alternative.  The meter that shows you how many minutes of the charge are remaining is sort of handy, the icon that lights to remind you to clean it is somewhat useful, but to say they're necessary would be a grave overstatement.  In fact, the ""wash me"" icon lights up after basically every use, so its necessity is particularly dubious.  (As a side note, it's marvelously easy to clean.)<br /><br />In the end, the product does receive my highest recommendation.  I think if you tried it out, you'd be pleased, and even if you had to send it back and didn't like it after three weeks via their guarantee (it does take time for your skin to adjust), there would be little time/money wasted.  I would, however, encourage you to check out the lower-end models.  Ultimately, even the high price point wasn't enough for me to downgrade to four stars.  I'm normally quite critical.",[],B000PKKAGO,B000PKKAGO,AEQJ7JR2SJGHQZIGO72D7RO7OVWA,1197475411000,2,False

4.0,Works pretty good on dry 4C,"This is a nice mask for the price. I have short hair & can get 2 uses from each packet (you get 10 packs). The softness is better if you also use the Royal Oils shampoo. When I used a different shampoo, the results weren't as good. Next time, I am going to use a cap and maybe even some wet heat to see if that helps. I think the issue is that my hair doesn't love coconut oil which is one of the ingredients - even though it's the 6th of 11 ingredients.<br /><br />The packs are pretty hefty and I think that I could stretch the use more by adding more water to my hair beforehand. But to be honest, I think that the R.O. conditioner works better than this mask!<br /><br />Love the R.O. line and I think this will work well if I use heat or leave it on longer than 5 minutes.

5.0,"As good (or better) than the expensive ""R"" brand!","Finally tried this after using a much pricier whitening toothpaste. This works as good (or better) and I can actually afford it. The other paste (well-known brand, starts with &#34;R&#34; lol) was good, but the price was too high and I stopped using it because of that. The other day, I found this in a two-pack at such a good price that I decided to give it a try. Guess what? I could see really good results after about the 3rd time using it. That's just as good as the other expensive brand. The taste of this one is nice and mild - which is a Plus because I don't like overpowering flavors. I can't believe it took me this long to try this one. I could've been saving so much money all this time...",[],B00M9ROBWU,B00M9ROBWU,AHE6A2KMCMQSOHCMNE7JQHSAHTRQ,1491542242000,1,False
5.0,Like the way it makes my natural & nappy hair feel,"This has the very, very *very* faintest plant-like scent (which is clean and pleasing). It's also thicker than I expected - almost like a whipped lotion. Before I used it on my hair, I rubbed some into the back of my hand to see if I'd have any kind of skin reaction. I did not. What I noticed is that once this absorbed, there was absolutely zero residue. I don't know what that means, but I was just curious. When I rub in other types of hair masks & treatments, I always get a sense of something left that I need to wash off. When I used this on my hair in the shower, I left it on for about<br />2 to 3 minutes after I had massaged it in according to the directions. (I have to stop and mention that I was also using the Daelong shampoo and conditioner set beforehand. That might be why I got my results.) This rinses out extremely well. My hair felt conditioned but with a lot less of the residual slip from other conditioners. That kind of worried me. I like to know that a treatment is doing something & the only way to tell until you've used it for a while is by the way your hair feels. Where I became so happy with this is an hour after rinsing it out. I have coarse and &#34;nappy&#34; natural African American hair. My hair tends to be extremely dry - especially after washing. A good conditioner keeps things in check until I can apply my leave-in products (oils, butters, sprays, etc.), but this time, my hair stayed soft and easy to comb through for at least 2 hours. It might have been longer, but I went ahead and applied my usual leave-ins. Still, I know that this did soften my hair (the day after, my hair is retaining softness without any more leave-in applications) without making it feel fragile. With they type of hair I have, I have to worry about breakage. I realize that I have probably been clogging up my scalp by over-doing it with the oils and butters. I like that I haven't had to use more of them for my hair to feel manageable. As a test, I'm going to try easing up on using so much leave-in stuff while I continue to use this.I think these guys are on to something here. I will have to come back and update this review as I use this for a while but, for now, I love the way this makes my hair feel, even after just one treatment. Normally, I only fully wash my hair once every four weeks or so. I will do a co-wash about every other week to keep it clean without stripping it. While I am testing this out, I plan to use it at least once a week as my co-wash. Like I said, I am also using the shampoo & conditioner of this brand. That might be a big part of why this worked so well for me, but I think that this would work just as good on its own. By the way, I'm going to alter my washing regimen for a while to use the shampoo and conditioner at least every other week. I almost forgot to mention the other thing I was concerned about: the label says that this makes the hair &#34;straight and silky&#34; - which is exactly what I, personally, DO NOT want. I love my texture and want to keep it. My texture is the kind that is prone to slow growth (because of breakage) so... I'm not worried about losing my naps. I'm thinking that this aids in stopping breakage more than anything.<br />I got this at a very steep discount.",[],B01ESTMN94,B01ESTMN94,AHE6A2KMCMQSOHCMNE7JQHSAHTRQ,1463540578000,0,False
4.0,"Great item, but there are more affordable alternatives","This works and works well. The reason I can't give it a full  5-star review is because of the price. There is a very similar product that is way cheaper and works as well or better than this one. I found Sole Magic online for about a dollar cheaper than this one. In superstores and drug stores, I found it for a couple of bucks. This one does work and I can't say one negative thing about it - other than the price. When a pedicure is around $20 (even here in Alaska where prices are high), and I can do upkeep with a similar foot smoothing pad for about $2, I just can't see paying almost $9 for this one. If other customers do want this one, I can tell you that it works, the shape is nice and makes it easy to grip and use with either hand. It's also nice that their is a coarse side and a finer side. One thing that I disagree with is that you could use this anywhere but on your feet. I don't know what would have to be going on with anyone's elbows or knees for them to use this on! All in all, a great product, but a bit overpriced when there are cheaper alternative items that are just as effective.",[],B00BAKTI1G,B07BRKRWRF,AHE6A2KMCMQSOHCMNE7JQHSAHTRQ,1453791005000,0,True
5.0,Pretty Pricey But Worth It!,"Love, love, LOVE this moisturizer. I love it so much that I may have replaced my Avon Anew. This one costs quite a bit, but the tiny travel sized tube will last a while. This is a VERY watery product, but that's great for 2 reasons: 1) a little bit goes a long way, and 2) it absorbs really well into the skin. The best way that I have found to apply this is to tap the lotion onto my fingertips, then just sort of dab it onto my face before rubbing it in. This saves on product and keeps me from spilling any from the tube. Like I said, this has a very &#34;wet&#34; texture, so you won't have to use much. The price is way up there but, compared to using a lot of a cheaper product (that doesn't work as well), or a same-priced product (but using more of it), this is the best value overall. I'm going to see how long the travel-sized tube lasts while I save up for a larger size. Since this is something I have to save for, I really wish there were more size/price choices. Still, I love this and I think my skin is getting addicted to it!",[],B008PRFL7M,B008PRFL7M,AHE6A2KMCMQSOHCMNE7JQHSAHTRQ,1411658270000,0,True

However, I am happy to report that not only did I not cut myself, but I also got a closer shave as a bonus.

One of the Samsung Chargers is directly from the S6 Edge Plus (supports Adaptive Fast Charging/Quick Charge 2.0), yet it fails to work 80% of the time on my S6 Edge Plus for whatever reason...<br /><br />Another issue is when I go away for overnight trips somewhere.  For a day, I could probably just get by with just the iPhone charger & Samsung charger, but when I have 3-4 night stays due to work, I have to pack all of them!!!  It's just a big hassle.  That's when I decided I'm just going to resort to buying a GOOD multi-port charger.  I've used Ankur devices in the past and I've been very pleased with all of them.  After reading various reviews, I decided the 3-port is perfect for my situation.<br /><br />For $25, you get a 3-port charger: 2 PowerIQ ports and 1 Quick Charge 2.0 port (which the Edge+ takes advantage of).<br /><br />I've used the Ankur PowerIQ tech before via an Ankur Car Charger and I can definitely say it's almost as good as the Quick Charge 2.0 technology.  What I like about it is that it supposedly &#34;detects&#34; what kind of device is connected to it and charges accordingly.  Whether this is true or snake oil, I can say that it charges my devices fast and never has any kind of power dip when you have multiple devices connected to it.  I use these two ports for my iPhone, Galaxy Tab4 and New Trent Battery pack.<br /><br />The single Quick Charge is dedicated to my Galaxy S6 phone and right out of the box (same cables and all), it would fast charge my phone 100% of the time.  Unlike my old stock Quick Charge Charger, it never seemed to work.  So when I'm charging my phone and seeing it will fully charge within an hour makes me happy!<br /><br />The only initial turnoff is the $25 sticker price.  Yes you get a multi-port charger, but I think maybe that sticker price will scare some people.  But after experiencing and using this product, I think that $25 is DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  Never have a poor quality/flaky charger again.  I'm 100% pleased with this item!",[],B017JSZKGY,B017JSZKGY,AHOOD7DBLBIUO6DB7DZMCWYBZS3Q,1461089562000,6,True

The handle is thick and easy to grasp, the blade holding area is thicker and stronger, plus there is a plastic safety insert which prevents inadvertent cuts while reaching for the stored shaver. The handle also includes a rasp, with a slide-off cover, which is a better and safer way to eliminate the more lightly calloused areas. Do invest in the blades which go with this shaver, they are very sharp and will hold their edge longer. This will help to prevent the cuts associated with cheaper blades, which become dull quickly. This device is a wise choice for those experiencing problems from thickly calloused feet, it other troublesome areas.<br /><br />The price is a bit high, thus my ranking of only four stars.",[],B001HS29LM,B001HS29LM,AEWQA6UYA4BZEKIL3KUJZUKM3CKQ,1442579850000,2,True

5.0,Overall Pleased!,"I purchased this unit on a Prime Day.  Reviews were mixed, but I was willing to take a chance at the sale price.  Very happy I did.  It looks a little less than 150% when flat ironed, but I like it that way because it looks more realistic.  Having too much hair makes it look wiggy.<br /><br />I immediately washed it, let it dry naturally, then flat ironed it.  I'm more of a straight hair girl.  The hair is very soft and took to straightening well.<br /><br />I didn't experience much shedding; a strand here and there.  It's only been a week and 1 wash, so we'll see.  Some shedding is always to be expected eventually though with any wig; just not crazy shedding.  I also haven't experienced any tangling.  I'm always looking for that, especially at the nape area, and it has been hot.  So the wig is winning there.<br /><br />The knots are slightly bleached.  I just added a little foundation powder and it worked well.  Best part is that the hairline was plucked to perfection.

5.0,Unflattering stock card; Beautiful Unit!,"Absolutely gorgeous wig! The stock card picture is so scary but please know that out the box, this wig is much better looking than it's marketing photo! Plenty of good parting space, the hairline only needed a small amount of plucking, soft bouncy hair with no smell. Beautiful! My natural hair is closer to a 4/30 so the 1b was a bit too dark for me. I bleached the knots and lifted the 1b to a brown and tried to bring the 30 further up for more ombre effect; like my hair. My only con so far is that the colors didn't flow. You have black and then blonde; no gradiation. I was able to customize to my liking. I did experience shedding after I washed it but very little and virtually none while styling. I blow dried it, flat ironed and wand curled it. Took heat very well! I'm so impressed. This is my first human hair wig and now that I've experienced Bigsophy, I'll be buying more! Bought the 1b/27 for my daughter. Can't wait to see hers! I know she'll lift it and dye it some crayon color!  Will update photos once I install it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+MV4xxCBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+MV4xxCBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+MV4xxCBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C5gcYqNoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C5gcYqNoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C5gcYqNoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IeZ3cOldL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IeZ3cOldL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IeZ3cOldL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKrxMm59L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKrxMm59L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MKrxMm59L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810+bmpzpQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810+bmpzpQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810+bmpzpQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Iq63LpaSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Iq63LpaSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Iq63LpaSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MxedH-llL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MxedH-llL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MxedH-llL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SkjoOg0AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SkjoOg0AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SkjoOg0AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ywOKRzaVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ywOKRzaVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ywOKRzaVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07SDNBHSX,B07SDNBHSX,AHU3U77QADYEB7DIFX6A62NKD67Q,1575464133260,1,True

I applied before getting in the shower at the mirror, to save water, and parted my hair at finger width intervals, wetting the bar as I went, rubbing it my scalp,  before showering, took less than 10 minutes, then once in shower I wet my hair a little bit, and it really lathered up.<br /><br />When I rinsed my hair, I could tell it was clean, felt different from bottle shampoo. You could feel the clean. It felt lighter than usual too..<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars, but I dont like the peppermint scent, but then I don’t like food scents in my toiletry products.

5.0,Great value - and great features,"I bought this to support my artist acrylic painting hobby - it is helpful to use a hand-held hair dryer to dry the paint on the canvas quickly so you don't have to sit around for 15 to 30 minutes waiting/watching paint dry.

It sports a good range of temperature and fan controls, and the attachments work well (especially the diffuser), attaching securely with a quick twist.  And, as a nice bonus, there is a blue or violet colored spot of light that is emitted when operating, showing me exactly where the dryer nozzle is pointed on my canvas.  I just love love love this dryer.

4.0,OK,"I tried this on thick curly 3c hair. The results were quite decent. You first wash your hair with the pre-treatment shampoo to clarify the hair and remove dirt and oils. At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron.

I hate to admit it but I'm old enough to have used Maybelline mascara when it came in a little red box- you moistened a brush (looked like a little hairbrush), stroked it across the dry mascara, making a paste, and applied it.  It took a lot of work.  Everyone I knew kept an extra dry brush for thinning clumps and distributing the mascara evenly.  Later, I kept an old empty mascara tube/brush for brushing lashes and evening out mascara applications.  These work SO much better!  Lashes are much longer and not clumpy with these wonderful brushes.  Also great for using after applying false eyelashes for blending/interspersing the false lashes with your own.  I gave some to my niece and my aunt to try, they like them as much as I.  The magenta color is nice too.  Fantastic!",[],B01BZPD2IA,B07916GWQN,AGNK6ATYRNYJDUY6CXJ2MNEIDEAA,1459531533000,0,False
5.0,Organized all my daily wear makeup into on easy to use area.,"This acrylic makeup organizer by MelodySusie is part of my ongoing effort to get myself more organized. Until recently my makeup was an absolutely disaster. I finally got sick of that and decided something needed to be done, so after gathering everything up (and culling a huge amount that I just do not use any more) I started sorting and putting things into this organizer. With several drawers and compartments it was easy to arrange everything in a compact space so I could still see everything. I also really liked the flexibility that this organizer offers. I currently have the dividers in place in the bottom drawer since I am using it to keep my most often worn pairs of earrings easily accessible, but if I were to ever get more makeup I could remove the dividers and use the drawer as it, and setthe divider on the counter on its own to hold additional items.<br /><br />The organizer itself seems to be well made - nice and sturdy with parts that fit together well and are well finished so there are no rough jagged edges. The included drawer liners are a nice touch and they help to keep things from rolling or rattling around each time I open and close a drawer. I like that the top section is a separate unit that can be removed as this makes cleaning much easier. I wear powdered foundation (that famous brand that you swirl and tap) and particles of it seem to get into everything. With a removable top tray, when it needs a deep cleaning I can just remove all my makeup from it and rinse it under the faucet without messing up the items that are in the drawers. That's not possible to do with an all in one unit where the top tray is attached to the base drawers.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy wih this organizer. It works very well for my makeup, though I can also see it working well for other uses. As an artist I can see it working very well in my studio to organize art supplies as well.<br /><br />I did receive this item at no cost for the purposes of testing and review.

Maybe it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I really enjoy the chewy leathery texture of them as well.  Something I discovered with these years ago is to spread them in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and stick them under the broiler for just a few minutes.. no more than it takes for them to just barely start to get a hint of brown. The texture completely changes to something crispy instead of chewy. Watch it though, they go from brown to black in the blink of an eye! Toasted up this way they also make for an unusual topping to a salad or a bowl of noodle soup.<br /><br />The original while package taro are my favorites, flavor wise, though sometimes I like the yellow and orange package ones too - they tend to be spicier, which I have to be in the mood for.",[],B00E4E269Q,B00E4E269Q,AHF57VHYENVKYRF2B66VJSRPJ6RQ,1454815328000,0,False

4.0,Great gentle facial tool for dogs that don't like having faces washed. May be lightening tear stains too--will update review.,"This is an interesting way to market a Konjac Sponge, i.e. for your pets. I have to say though, it's pretty brilliant. I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it can remove tear stains, but given how hard they are to get rid of I somehow doubt it. I'll update the review if it works well over time though!<br /><br />Please note I most likely purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. In order to save time, I do as much of my shopping online as is humanly possible. I rely heavily on other customers reviews when making purchasing decisions, so as such, I take the honest and unbiased bit very seriously.

5.0,This Mask Is Awesome,"So I've tried A LOT of sheet masks and NONE of them worked for me. They either broke me out, or didn't secure on my face right, or they just didn't do anything for my face at all. This is the first sheet mask where I actually felt my face responding to it in a good way. It smelled just like citrus without it being too overpowering, nor was the tingly sensation, it told me that it was working! I also liked how this wasn't dripping with ampoule, it had the perfect amount to soak the face without it making a mess on your countertop or where the stuff would be rolling down your face and to your chest or creeping towards your eyes. So that in turn made wearing this more relaxing and not so irritating and awkward like most if not all the other sheet masks I tried. I almost didn't want to remove it, that's how much I enjoyed and loved it! I couldn't believe how baby soft smooth my skin was after using it. It wasn't a life-changer or game-changer for my hyperpigmentation, but it's unrealistic and next to impossible for any product to do that after only one use. My skin loved this though, I can tell that this is perfect for my skin type (combination/oily acne prone skin). I thought I'd swore off sheet masks. Granted, I'm still not blown away by sheet masks in general, this mask hasn't made me a fan of them, BUT...I'd totally buy this again.

I'd say that's my biggest complaint. They stretch in the back but not in the front so it's hard to get them to cover all of your hair. You still have to push hair up inside with your fingers after placing it on your head. I have long hair but it's fine and medium density so it's no terrible fitting all of my hair inside but I can image it might be very tough if you have long, thick, high density hair.

I mostly use it for nights where I can't sleep or in mornings when I wake up with anxiety. It has helped with both.

5.0,Under the Heading of - Why Did I Wait So long to Try This,"And also - where has this been all my life? I have long, very thick, wavy, mostly frizzy hair. I hated washing it because it took. So. Long. To wash it, and then rinse it and then condition it and rinse it again. Sigh. Hair washing days means 30 min showers. Anyway, I often got flakes, not dandruff, just flakes that I always chalked up to the tons of products I need to tame my mane. After using this little scrubby I now realize it was because I was never getting my scalp and the hair closest to my scalp completely clean. Lathering up and then using this to massage my scalp, my hair is so much cleaner and TBH behaves a bit better. And I'm now down to washing it only 2x a week because it's now so clean, it takes longer to show build up from all my products. I read some folks don't like this because they say it tangles their hair. Not true. I can speak from experience, they are not getting their hair wet enough. In order to get a good cleaning - with or without this - you must SOAK your head completely and lather completely. This little scrubby will glide through the shampoo. And if you don't want to wash your hair every time you want a little scalp massage, then just soak and put a little conditioner in your hair. This works and it works well.",[],B07MRGWQSJ,B07MRGWQSJ,AHRWVSFDNUIOQVXTRWOIC4ANDJGA,1606232348914,0,True

Fifty years ago I seem to remember being told that it's never too early to start taking care of your skin. Well, I hope it's never too late either! I like the Neem facial cleanser very much. It smells organic, a bit fruity with a tinge of avocado scent. It is creamy and feels nourishing as I apply it to my face. The ingredients are all listed on the back label. This facial cleanser is soothing. It just feels very nice and cleans effectively also. One of the nicest things about this cleanser that I didn't realize until after I had purchased it is that with each purchase you are helping orphaned children get clean water and a safe home. See africaheartwoodproject.org. How cool is that! Oh, also I bought the 2 ounce size and I didn't plan this but it came in handy as I had to travel last weekend and the 2 ounce bottle fit perfect in my travel case along with all the other stuff that us older beauty's need to pack. Anyway, I really think this cleanser is a fine product. I like using it because it cleanses as it should and feels nourishing upon my skin. For me it's a keeper and I think anyone who wants a good for you cleanser should give this one a try. I don't have to worry about my skin too much because I'm naturally beautiful, pretty much flawless...

5.0,Great for dry skin,"I am very impressed with this Organic Moringa Oil. It has a very slight but engaging smell which is earthy, enticing, and invigorating. I became intrigued after reading about the many benefits of Moringa oil so I decided it might be worth trying. I ordered from Inn & Co because their Moringa oil is 100 % organic. Also because I am always on the look out for value and good prices, and this Moringa oil comes in a good sized bottle about 4 inches tall which holds 4 fluid ounces of oil. That is a good size as a lot of oils come in much smaller bottles and cost just as much. So Moringa oil is filled with antioxidants and phytonutrients along with supposedly reducing wrinkles and sagging fatigued skin. It also boasts anti inflammatory benefits. So here I am to report that the oil, along with being a delight to smell, is refreshing, relaxing, and hydrating to my face and hands. No, my wrinkles have not wondrously disappeared but I can report that my dry skin on my face is being diminished. As for my hands a little bit of the Moringa oil rubbed in both of my hands leaves them feeling so luxuriously hydrated I just want to hold hands with everybody! I'm really enjoying this oil. I think it's a great asset to my unending quest in preserving what small amount of beauty I have left. Plus it makes me feel good and it sure does pamper my skin.

Each one of the soap bars emits a soft, sweet odor which is very pleasant. The lovely earthy aroma comes from the organic oils of Palm, Coconut, Olive, Palm Kernel, Patchouli essential oil blend, Organic hemp seed oil and Rosemary extract preservative. The soap produces a mild lather and leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and nourished. It is a good soap for my normally dry skin. Along with using as a bath soap I also use this soap on my face and it leaves my face clean and soft. The soap bars arrive in a brown cardboard box clearly marked with the name of the product and is eligible for Amazon Prime delivery. I think this soap is wonderful.

5.0,Made in U.S.A.,"I am very pleased with the Lavender Castile Soap from Cornucopia Brands Natural Soap. It came in a plastic bottle which was a much larger bottle than I expected! I do wish it had come with a pump fixture on top but it has a simple cap. A pump would help to make it easier to dispense the product.  The Lavender castile soap is safe for all skin types. This Castile soap has all natural ingredients and is non toxic. I am so far using this soap a regular soap in the shower, etc.  The lavender castile soap is infused with a natural lavender essential oil blend, and also has organic aloe Vera and other oils. The Lavender oil scent does not overcome the slight medicinal smell, just so you know. I appreciate the Lavender Castile Soap from Cornucopia Brands as it is a natural soap, no Lauryl Sulfates or petroleum derivatives. Also it is made in the United States of America. This soap is gentle enough to use on hair and body yet effective enough to also use as an all natural household cleaner. If you have never used castile soap the scent may take some getting used to as it is not filled with all kinds of artificial scents as so many products are.

I have never experienced that with any other natural shampoos or conditioners.  When I rinsed my hair, I got a small pea sized clump of hair come out.  I tried this conditioner a few more days, but had the same burning sensation and pea sized clumps come out.  I went back to using the other shampoo/conditioner I was previously using and I did not get any clumps of hair, nor did my scalp burn.  I guess this is just me since the other reviews seem good, but I cannot use this.  The only thing I did like was the way it smelled.",[],B01IIUP1XE,B01IIUP1XE,AEHDW7JVUP3VY5UN5YDZ3D7XEMLQ,1498411850613,0,False
5.0,Both Work Great,"I saw this and really wanted to try it since it came with both shampoo and conditioner.  You always have to purchase them separately.  The price is actually pretty good for what you get.  A little goes a long way.  I haven't been using this very long, but I have already noticed a difference in my hair shedding in the shower. Both have a good scent without being too overpowering. These actually leave my hair feeling and looking healthier. My hair has started to thin out and I wanted to stop it before it got too bad. It really leaves my hair feeling clean and restored. I do wash my hair daily with this shampoo and conditioner, but the bottle has lasted a long time. I put the shampoo on my wet hair in the shower and massage into my scalp, leave on for a minute, and then wash out with the warm shower water.  I then do the same with the conditioner.  I love all of the natural ingredients and that they do not test on animals. I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />I received this product at discount for my honest testing and review.

5.0,Works Great,"I am only in my thirties, but my skin gets beat up pretty bad a work and it is starting to show. So far this has helped my skin look healthier. It makes my skin feel so smooth, soft, hydrated, and healthy. I love all the natural ingredients it has in it. This has really made my feel healthy again. I still have acne prone skin and this has helped with that too. I love the jojoba beads in it.  They gently scrub your skin clean without any pain or redness.  I use this in the shower in the morning.  I just get my face wet, squeeze a small amount of the cleanser in my hand, rub on my face, and wash off with the warm shower water.

5.0,Excellent hand cream,"UPDATE - 09/30/16 ========================================<br />Still loving this moisturizer and just ordered another package. This stuff goes on well, absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling! My skin feels truly moisturized. I love using it on my hands and feet before bedtime, this way it really absorbs into my skin overnight.<br />Love it, love it, love it!<br /><br />========================================================<br />Not many people know this, or give it another thought sometimes - anything you put on your skin gets absorbed through the skin and ends up in the blood stream. This is why I am rather careful when picking my skin care products. I have been staying away from most hand creams for a while now just because for the most part there's at least a few potential carcinogens lurking among the ingredients.  Even though the big famous brand creams make your skin feel wonderful the question is if the trade off is worth it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even so called organic products aren't always that safe. Provided, manufacturers of this goodness are disclosing all the ingredients on the label (and not hiding anything) this cream looks safe enough to eat. Therefore, I have been happily slathering it all over my hands (and any other body parts needing additional moisture) in the past few weeks and I am quite pleased with the results.<br /><br />This white fluffy goodness feels surprisingly light and absorbs quickly into the skin. I must admit, it is a tad thinner in texture than I had expected but on the other hand this lightness ensures there's no oily residue left on your hands. The cream has no scent whatsoever which is a definite positive for those who are sensitive or don't particularly appreciate scented products. I'm adding a drop of essential oil of my choice (whatever I feel like that day) when I apply the cream if I feel like smelling something nice. Basically this cream is your blank canvas and leaves much room for creativity.<br /><br />One thing I would probably change about this product is the packaging. (At least maybe as an option for buyers to choose from) I really think that tubes are better for hand creams - way easier to dispense and so much more hygienic (sticking your fingers into the container doesn't really help keep it germ free). Other than that I am happy to give this product my approval.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, all opinions are based on my own personal experience with the product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RuODEC8bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RuODEC8bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61RuODEC8bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VcM52BqwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VcM52BqwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VcM52BqwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ntoNxa0ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ntoNxa0ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ntoNxa0ML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0108V1QFI,B0108V1QFI,AFZAXGTEJHTDFZSZB6CRZ4QDBKGQ,1448860626000,3,False

5.0,Decent for it's price point.,"[[VIDEOID:5e37579b01c9e26d7c0d83a26f8153a7]] *as a licensed cosmetologist, I'm reviewing this item from a personal as well as professional standpoint*<br /><br />I am almost 30 years old, and still suffer from breakouts. I have seen dermatologist and tried a lot of things but they often dry out my skin too much, causing my skin to produce MORE sebum (oil) combining with the  medicines side effect of dry dead skin sells. This is a fast way to disaster skin-wise and often causes my skin to worsen. Because of this, I have tried many different facial cleansing devices, and here are the points that I like about this one.<br /><br />1) Rechargable! Nothing is worse than needing to use a facial scrubber only to find that the batteries are dead. I cannot tell you how many times that the batteries have died (in other models) and then to make it worse, I often discover a mess of rust when I open up the compartment to change the batteries. The fact that this unit can be easily charged through a micro USB is not only convenient but also costs less and is safer.<br /><br />2) Variety- all the different attachments that come with this unit is a nice little bonus. I can't genuinely say that I would use all of them (remember, trained in skin Haha) but as a consumer I still appreciate the additional options.<br /><br />3) Quality- at this price point, it's surprisingly well made. I was a little concerned with the rubber cap that protects the USB port, but other than that, it's sturdy. The plastic does not flex at all, and it feels solid.<br /><br />4) Sound- I never thought that something like sound would bother me, but I definitely noticed how quiet this unit is compared to other models I've owned. I have two small children, so I'd often have to go to a bathroom further away from their bedrooms to cleanse my face at night, but with the noise level of this cleaner, i'm just genuinely not concerned with waking them.<br /><br />The only 'con' that I've found personally is the speed of rotation vs the softness of the bristles. I feel like it would be more productive to either have the head rotate faster or have harder bristles. Having said that, skin is very thin, especially when it's sensitive like mine. I DO prefer the softer bristles, because they are much kinder to my skin and I don't have to worry about causing more damage to inflamed areas. However, the brush's rotation was just too slow for me, (please see my review video for a short view of the rotation)  and I felt impatient at how long it took to get a thorough round of cleansing and sloughing to my face. Because of this, I cannot rate at 5 stars because it's just simply not as good as it could be. But, all things considered it's still a good sturdy competitor at its price point in today's market.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review.

5.0,Results In 1 Week - See Before & After Pics,"[[VIDEOID:f2b369e0d51ead5b1e259f05074a0f65]] I was actually shocked when I looked at the pictures I took of my face of &quot;before&quot; and 7 days &quot;after&quot; using this miracle massage tool. I have been using this tool once per day at night for 7 days (I missed 1 day out of the 7 days) in combination with my normal nightly face routine. Prior to using the face tool, I apply a liberal amount of my eye cream so that there is still some that is not completely rubbed into my skin (the instructions recommend using an eye gel or similar product). I then use the wider, blunted tip on the tool and slowly move the tip around my face and pause in each area for about 5-10 seconds per the instruction manual.<br /><br />The tool itself is about 6.5&quot; long and feels like a wide marker when held in your hand. It is powered by 1 AAA battery (not included) and has a power button with 2 intensity levels. When turned on, the tool emits bionic waves via the tool's tip when it makes contact with your skin (see demonstration in video). The lower wave intensity is supposed to be used for slight to moderate wrinkle reduction and the higher intensity is meant for deeper wrinkles. However, during my testing, I used the higher intensity level exclusively (all of my wrinkles looked deep to me lol). The instructions state that the tool can be used up to twice per day (with at least 6hrs between each treatment time) and should be used on clean skin. Treatments do not cause any pain/discomfort and do not leave any marks or redness on your face.<br /><br />This wrinkle eraser is incredibly easy to use, though does take some time dedication if you follow the recommended 5-10sec per skin surface area. I have already begun to see results (thanks to remembering to take &quot;before&quot; pictures) and will 110% continue to use this tool indefinitely. Now that I know the tool works, I'm going to start using the smaller tip on the wrinkles just under my lash lines in addition to using the broader tip around my eyes. I am looking forward to seeing more results, and I would highly recommend this product to others.<br /><br />*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

5.0,Simple to Use & Perfect Results Every Time!!,"I LOVE these bun makers!! I have an old bun maker that I've been using for years, but that one just got tossed in the trash because these new ones are SO much easier to use and the finished product looks much better!! These bun makers are unique in that they are foam, which helps to grip your hair to better hold it in place. They also have a very strong inner wire that holds them in place in a perfect circle. I have relatively long (just past my bust line) hair with long layers - the trick to getting all of the end pieces of the layers to stay tucked in place is to pull the bun maker down the length of your ponytail just before you reach the end of the shortest layer. Then, fold all of the rest of the ends upward over the hair piece and tuck them inward towards the center of the ponytail. As you roll the hair piece upwards, continue to tuck any loose ends in so that they are held in place by the rolled hair. The other trick to getting a perfectly round bun is that once you have rolled the hair piece all the way up with your hair, fold the ends inward towards each other to form a circle, but make sure to tighten this circle as much as possible by pushing the ends as close together as you can. Otherwise, these hair pieces are fairly self-explanatory to use, and there are step-by-step instructions included with each of the four bun maker pieces. In addition to these four pieces, this product also includes 2 sets of 8 bobby pins -- 1 set is about 2&quot; long each and the other set is about 3&quot; long.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R1-wdtCBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R1-wdtCBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R1-wdtCBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-EQLdyHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-EQLdyHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-EQLdyHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n0pOWhcFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n0pOWhcFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n0pOWhcFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u0Snoe-0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u0Snoe-0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u0Snoe-0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B014SRAOVK,B014SRAOVK,AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ,1462780853000,9,False
5.0,Works for Eye Puffiness & Amazing Off-Label Headache Relief!!,"This eye cream was far different than I was expecting -- but in a GREAT way. I'm 29-years-old, so the lines around my eyes aren't terribly deep, although they are probably deeper than many other females my age due to my sun-worshiping in earlier years. I do suffer, however, from severe seasonal allergies and am constantly plagued with dark circles (&#34;allergic shiners&#34; as they call them) and extreme puffiness of both my upper eyelids and just under my eyes (the infamous &#34;bags&#34;).<br /><br />To be honest, my impression of this cream at first glance wasn't too great. For starters, the jar of cream was much smaller than I had imagined, but I guess that's my fault for not noticing the (very) small-printed &#34;0.5 fl oz&#34; on the label in the picture. (I do think that this was a little deceitful though, because the size/amount of this cream is not listed anywhere on the product description.) In addition, while trying to read the teeny tiny print on the jar, I also almost immediately noticed a spelling typo on the front of the label that reads &#34;Nautral & Healthy&#34; rather than &#34;Natural & Healthy.&#34; I know this seems like a rather minuscule and knit-picky detail to point out, but it did make me at least wonder about this company's quality control standards.<br /><br />Despite my initial impression, I gave the company/cream the benefit of the doubt and have been using it for the last few days. With my first application under my eyes, the cream felt more on the &#34;thin&#34; side (similar to a lotion rather than thick cream), but while rubbing the cream into my skin in a circular motion, the moisture that the cream delivered was far better than I anticipated. It takes at least 3-4 minutes before your skin feels like the cream is completely absorbed, which gave me ample time to slowly massage the area during absorption (and felt very soothing and relaxing). I had absolutely no issues with any side effects or skin reactions such as burning, tingling, redness, or irritation. I noticed a small &#34;immediate&#34; reduction in the pores and fine lines of the areas I applied the cream, though not as impressive as some of the Retinol and Vitamin C serums that I've used in the past. There was no obvious difference in the dark circles or puffiness right after application, however, within about 30-45min, the puffiness started to visibly decrease and the area all around my eyes felt less tender/achy in general.<br /><br />With each subsequent application, I noticed the same resulting decrease in puffiness as was observed initially. My puffiness did return each morning, but I expected because I'm still constantly being exposed to my allergens. (After all, the cream is meant to relieve a symptom of my allergies, not be a miracle cure for my chronic systemic condition.) I've noticed that if I apply the cream immediately before bed and spend more time rubbing it into my skin in the circular motions, I do have a noticeable decrease in the morning when I wake up compared to before I started using the cream. As far as the under-eye dark circles, I can't tell a difference so far - but in all fairness, I've only been using the cream for 4 days (twice daily) so there's still hope.<br /><br />Now for the best part (in my opinion, at least). On the second night of using this cream, I had yet another one of my throbbing headaches (allergies are the worst!!) About 15-20min after my evening cream application, I noticed that my headache felt a little better -- I'm not saying that there was some miraculous change here, but it did feel less severe. This was very unusual for me, as I hadn't taken any ibuprofen or Zyrtec at that point (my usual go-to medications when my headaches are severe). The only thing I could think that I had done differently this time than any other time was that I applied the cream -- it was a strange connection, but stranger things have certainly happened to me. I went back to look at the ingredients listed on the jar and saw that it had rooibos in it. I had absolutely no idea what this was (and probably didn't notice it the first time I looked because I don't have a magnifying glass), but I looked it up online and read that it's an herb from South Africa with a laundry-list of health benefits -- including antioxidant properties and... headache relief?!?! Although still relatively skeptical that this was just a coincidence and that I had gotten &#34;lucky&#34; on my google search, I was still optimistic and proceeded to rub the eye cream on my temples and at the base of my skull to see what would happen. After a good 30-45min, my headache was almost completely gone. I know this headache thing sounds ridiculous and obscure, but I encourage anyone to research this mysterious Rooibos for themselves. I haven't had a headache as severe as that one since, but I have had a few headaches start to come on, and with each headache, I applied the cream to my temples, under my eyes, and to the base of my skull and the feeling has gone away each time within about an hour.<br /><br />With all of this said, I couldn't rate this &#34;eye&#34; cream turned headache remedy anything less than 5 stars despite my initial less-than-thrilled first impression. Because the cream is light and only requires a very small amount with each application, I think the small jar will actually last me a reasonably long time, too. Between the headache relief and the disappearing eye bags, I would be confident in recommending this product to others. I was also fortunate to receive my first jar of this cream at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OTfGMIsrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OTfGMIsrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OTfGMIsrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C2M3VIQ,B01C2M3VIQ,AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ,1457502402000,8,False
4.0,"Great heat protection, somewhat difficult to clean","I ordered this silicone pad to place on my vanity so that I could rest my curling/straightening irons on it while getting ready without having to worry about scorching the wood vanity top. Overall, it works well and it just small enough to squeeze between the two drawers that come up on either side of my vanity. I have a love/hate feeling for the little raised &#34;dots&#34; that cover each side of the mat. I like them because they raise the hot tool when resting on the mat to give extra heat protection to my vanity top underneath it. However, I also put my makeup on at my vanity and because of the silicone surface, every little drop of makeup powder is attracted to and clings to the silicone mat surface. The silicone isn't that difficult to clean (I use either pledge spray or a lysol wipe), but the little raised dots make it difficult to get into all the little grooves in order to get the mat perfectly clean. I could move the mat while I put my makeup on, but I don't have many places to put it on where I get ready, so this would be a huge inconvenience. Plus, regardless of where i put the mat, it will still collect dust overtime and have the same cleaning issue.<br />As a solution to cleaning the mat, I started running it under warm water and using a dish brush with bristles to scrub the mat and get in those difficult grooves, which has been successful as far as perfectly cleaning the mat - it's just a little more tedious than I'd like it to be.",[],B00A0RUGPM,B00A0RUGPM,AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ,1455521957000,1,True

5.0,Great concept!,"Throw away your old tweezers, and bring in this guy. These are time savers! Instead of plucking each individual hair just spring for this baby. It plucks at hair the same way, but cuts the time dramaticly. When I say the same I mean the same too. So don't expect it to be pain free cause its not. The entire thing is practically a giant spring. It closes on your hair, and when you twist it. It pulls away all the hair it catches.<br /><br />Conclusion: it's not the most comfortable, but it works. It hurts, but only for a little, and in my opinion it's way better then taking off each individual hair off. And the little blade is basically for a closer, or better finish.<br /><br />And if you found this useful in anyway hit that helpful button for me.

5.0,natural remover that actually works.. yes it's true!,"So when you hear &#34;natural&#34; nail polish remover what comes to mind? For me I thought &#34;there is no way this is going to work&#34;. So what do I do I order it anyways because hey I love the earth, but I want to be pretty too. I've had this stuff for like a week already and even though my toes look like they have been through war I still just keep staring at it. Well today I finally decide to take the plunge. I read all of the instructions and see that you have to let it &#34;sit&#34; on your nails for 2-5 minutes. It's very difficult for me to stay still that long, so I figure I'll try it out and see what happens. Mind you I am not trying this on any regular nail polish, no. I have the polish from my last pedicure which is a light pink glitter polish AKA the worst type of polish to try to remove. I feel like I'm setting this stuff up to fail, right. So I grab the dropper and fill it up. I place a few drops on each toe (for those of you keeping track this is a watery formula and will not stay well if you move at all). I did keep moving about my business for 5-6 minutes. I then return with some cotton pads. I wipe the big toe not expecting much and almost the entire polish wipes away in one swipe. I kid you not more than 3/4 of the polish was gone in one swipe. I'm in disbelief at this point, so I stare and pick at it like it's going to talk to me. After a few minutes in awe I finish the rest of my toes. I did have to go back and do it one more time because my toes are very curved and like I said I cannot sit still, however it didn't bother me at all. This stuff removed disgusting glitter polish in less time and less smell than any other product I've ever used. I am so impressed that I keep staring at the pad I used to remove the polish. It's like it just melted it into a sheet and it just slides off of my nail. It's really cool. I am impressed also that I do not need a ton of this stuff to remove all the polish for my toes so I'm thinking it will last a while. I will re-order this stuff once mine runs out. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wears nail polish ever. I do need to mention that I did receive this product for free to review. Please understand that my review is based only on my own experience with this product and the cost has no impact on my review.",[],B01AYTGWA8,B01AYTGWA8,AFHH4LYKFBZE5VZNRJR6QT7IWDWQ,1461808127000,0,False
5.0,get this brush set now - you will not regret it. Great as a gift or for yourself. large mix of types of brushes!,"This brush set is really good. I was really impressed with the quality. I haven't experienced any fallout from any of the brushes so far. I've had the set for a few weeks now. They are not labeled, so for a beginner like me it is a little hard to tell which brushes to use, but I just do what feels right and what I've seen in videos. I really like the quality of these brushes. They apply powder and liquid well and I don't see issues with what I've used so far. I haven't been able to try all of the brushes, but I even let my friend use a few and she agreed that they were so soft and well made. I love the little case they came in as well. I did wash them before I used them and I had no discoloration. I put a picture of my favorite brush because I'm so obsessed with it. I would recommend these brushes to any one new to makeup or not. I plan to purchase these as gifts for a few friends because I have enjoyed them so much. I did receive this set at a discount in exchange for my review, however the opinions are all my own.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KYMN4uU3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KYMN4uU3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KYMN4uU3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QdVHzQDYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QdVHzQDYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QdVHzQDYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lh9n479sL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lh9n479sL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lh9n479sL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGZkCW1TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGZkCW1TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pGZkCW1TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01495J3MM,B01495J3MM,AFHH4LYKFBZE5VZNRJR6QT7IWDWQ,1455302642000,1,False

The headbands themselves were additionally wrapped up in their own individual bags. These headbands come in different colors which expands the flexibility to wear with my favorite workout gear. The manufacturer doe provide a 100 percent money back guarantee, but I have been happy with mine based on the softness, their ability to keep sweat and hair out of my eyes in addition to the quality of the material and manufacturing process.

5.0,This is that perfect item I was looking for,"I got these after watching this YouTube video from this Youtuber who tested this out.<br />[...] my hair is a little shorter than hers and I'm working on growing it out from a pixie cut, so I have a bunch of crazy weird layers in my hair. I needed an alternative to the typical elastic hair tie to throw my hair up. I'm afraid I wear my hair up so often that I probably have a big line of breakage across my hair from where the hair tie goes. This is that perfect item I was looking for. It's easy and I get multiple looks out of it. It's even fancier than just popping my hair up in a pony tail, so I don't feel obligated to fix my hair before I go out if I've had it up with this device. Sometimes some of my shorter strands do fall out of this, but that is because those strands are barely long enough for an elastic- not this products fault!

So for those who do have sensitive skin, you might want to try a test patch first!

3.0,Not for me,"I hadn't had much experience with waxing, however I have tried wax pearls before and that definitely wasn't working for me, and though I usually just stick with good old fashioned razors but I thought I would try these easy to use wax strips. They are pretty easy to use too! The instructions are on the back of the box and they even have pictures for you to follow. To heat up the wax strips all you have to do is use your hands and rub them and the heat from your body allows the wax to warm up enough for you to pull the paper apart. You simply stick the wax strips on the area that you want the hair removal. It didn't really say how long you should leave it on before removing it but I feel like it needs to cool a bit to get a bit harder before you pull it off. One of my issues is that I didn't feel like it pulled off all the hair that I wanted to be gone within that area that I put the strip. If I am going to go through some pain for this hair removal I don't want to have to do it multiple times on the same area of skin. To finish up you are supposed to open the post cleaning wipes, however they left my skin oily and feeling kind of greasy and I didn't like those. I preferred to finish up with some of my own CBD lotion. Overall I think it worked, but not well enough for my liking.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615qAMlzqQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615qAMlzqQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615qAMlzqQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CVE0MJYeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CVE0MJYeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CVE0MJYeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J3BB2VCwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J3BB2VCwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J3BB2VCwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j1KcY+ZvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j1KcY+ZvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j1KcY+ZvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tjCLW4KbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tjCLW4KbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tjCLW4KbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XgSVwA+ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XgSVwA+ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XgSVwA+ZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71huSl-fvFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71huSl-fvFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71huSl-fvFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ooaGnFvmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ooaGnFvmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ooaGnFvmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07X6DWRG6,B07X6DWRG6,AGCQR2QLP3XWU64TBYFJCAZWQQKQ,1582070527471,1,True
5.0,"Easy to use and wash out, not for long hair",This product is actually really cool and just as easy to use in real life as it seems like in the pictures. Comes with a silvery tone putty type substance in a little container all you have to do is put your hands in kind of rub it around your hands and then run it through your hair. It was really the easy to do on someone else but takes a little bit more time to do on yourself though if you get some on your skin or ears or wherever you can just take a wet damp towel or a white or something like that and wipe it right off. In the picture that shows you doing it too long hair but I tried it on my long hair and absolutely did not work I could not pull a comb through it and it was hard and strange and it definitely works better on men's hair that is short. When it was dry it got kind of hard like a gel or something like that. It's really easy to make it look nice you just have to continue working it through the hair until you get the desired color and style that you want. We tried it on a beard as well and it didn't look as good on the beard it kind of looked better on the medium to short hair but not super super short like a beard. We even used it and my boyfriend's hair who is African-American and it came out pretty cool. Kind of makes you look like you have silver gray hair. It was really easy to wash out renting it out just with water gets a lot of it off but a little bit of shampoo get it out in just a second. I don't recommend going to bed with this in your hair as it will leave silver glimmery stuff on your pillowcase to make sure you wash before going to sleep or laying down on anything.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610OtbxuFqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610OtbxuFqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610OtbxuFqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611E8xr88fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611E8xr88fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611E8xr88fL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614+js6+eUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614+js6+eUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614+js6+eUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YdaeufZwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YdaeufZwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YdaeufZwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pL+Yj-3RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pL+Yj-3RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pL+Yj-3RL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rs1mmcAML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rs1mmcAML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rs1mmcAML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CiBFaelcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CiBFaelcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CiBFaelcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOHstYrqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOHstYrqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOHstYrqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gdjg7cV9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gdjg7cV9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gdjg7cV9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H0tuMKfgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H0tuMKfgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H0tuMKfgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NE4kafm2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NE4kafm2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NE4kafm2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-FqufmwgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-FqufmwgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-FqufmwgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B-EJYNg8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B-EJYNg8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B-EJYNg8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B073CW1R4T,B073CW1R4T,AGCQR2QLP3XWU64TBYFJCAZWQQKQ,1555975712037,1,True
4.0,Honestly couldnt get it into my routine long enough to see if it truely works.,"So far I couldn't get this product in my routine for long enough to see how well it works at all. I don't want to give it a bad review because of my lack of ambition with it, but I don't want to lie and say that its an amazing product either. This Biotin Infused Zenlash Eyelash Growth Serum is definitely easy to use. It comes in a little wrapped bottle similar to a mascara bottle, except the brush looks more like a detail nail polish brush. The idea is simple, you brush it on your lash line everyday and wait and watch. It was a bit hard for me to get my lid closed all the way and brush this one, but I am not one who uses make up much either. If you do use make up it will probably come a lot faster for ya. I did accidentally get a bit in my eye before and I was happy to see, though it doesn't feel good, it didn't irritate me much either. I really wish I could say that I saw a huge transformation, but after only managing to use it for one straight week, I didn't see much difference.<br /><br />~Thanx~","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31KAz76crPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31KAz76crPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31KAz76crPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jB8DGINQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jB8DGINQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jB8DGINQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31rEIlIuHfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31rEIlIuHfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31rEIlIuHfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Odd6mFyFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Odd6mFyFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Odd6mFyFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lFN25Pu5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lFN25Pu5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lFN25Pu5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XtFKC4hlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XtFKC4hlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XtFKC4hlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B014FE69WE,B014FE69WE,AGCQR2QLP3XWU64TBYFJCAZWQQKQ,1489888193000,0,False
5.0,Fit me well even though I am  plus size with a large head.,"This ShungHO Hairband Cap Woolen Braiding Knitted Headband is much better quality than I was even expecting. It came in just a clear plastic cover. The braiding and knit of the yarn is very nice, with no frayed or loose hanging ends that I could see. The braiding looks super cute, and would go well with some braided boot socks. It does feel like wool, so it is a bit scratchy but not uncomfortably so. It was thicker than I expected it to be and keeps your head nice and warm. I did notice it seems to ride up on the back of my head a bit which I do not like, but that is no problem of the product, just the nature of the design. It looks a bit strange with your hair down but looks pretty cute with it up in a messy bun. I think I would have liked it a bit more if it was a bit less wide, because it covers so much that it looks a bit strange. I do however, like the fact that it covers pretty much half of my ears as well, to keep them nice and cozy during cold evenings and frosty mornings.

5.0,"Great smell, I only wish it lasted longer.","This Black Intense For Men is so refreshing. A bit intense when first sprayed on, but very mellow shortly afterwards. It reminds me of a lot of scents that say &#34;refreshing&#34; or &#34;water.&#34; I absolutely love the smell. Its not even super manly either and could almost be worn by a woman without much notice. I definitely love this smell on my fiance and I think it is my most favorite of all the polo inspired scents by Watermark Beauty. Of course like most of the other ones my biggest issue is that they not not last all day long. They start puttering out about halfway through the day and will need to be re-applied, and also like most others it comes in a large 3.0 Fl. Oz./ 90 ml bottle, so it should last a while even with a second application every day. It is inspired by Black Cologne but I have not had the chance to smell it so I cant tell you how close they are, nor do I care because this scent is amazing. Recommended!

5.0,Manly sexy scent!,"The biggest issue with all of the colognes by Watermark Beauty is the fact that they do not last strong or long. You need to reapply to make sure you still smell good by the end of the night. That being said this leopard For Men, Eau De Parfum smells amazing. Its very manly and I love the scent of it on my fiance! It reminds me of a water fresh shaving cream or aftershave and is very nice smelling, sort of aspin-like, light and not too strong. The bottle is relatively large and at 3.3 Fl. Oz. / 100 ml even if you have to reapply during the afternoon it should last a while. The bottle is sleek and modern looking with its flat black matte surface. The black clear lid does not snap on well however and comes off easily. The spray pump makes it easy to apply, and its definitely one of my top 5 scents that my fiance owns.

3.0,Not for me.,"Wow. This Super Star For Women, Eau de Toilette by Watermark Beauty is strong. Not my favorite by far, but lasts well throughout the day. That being said when I spray myself it is so strong I have the need to want to wave away some of the scent it really invades your nostrils. The first whiff is overwhelming of alcohol, and needs some time to disperse to make it smell better. One spray should do just fine, so this 2.7 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml will last for a long time. The bottle is very cute, and the pink liquid in the clear glass makes it look very feminine. It even has a plastic top that looks like crystal, very cute. Inspired By Juicy Couture Perfume, but I cant imagine Juicy would smell like this.Overwhelmingly floral, its okay, but its more like something my grandmother would wear.

5.0,Very nice scent.,"At first I did not know if I really liked this  Diva Scent For Women, Eau De Parfum, but after a few days of wear it is really starting to grow on me. It is supposed to be inspired by Juicy, however I have not ever tried Juicy before so I cant tell you how close it is unfortunately. I can tell you, however, that it smells very fruity with a milk floral scent. Very sweet and refreshing and very hip for the younger women. Almost like a fruity dryer sheet, but in a good way. It comes in a rectangular clear bottle and the perfume itself is pink and very girly, it even has a pink bow around the spray nozzle. I think this 2.8 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml bottle should last quite a while, and after 3 good sprays in the morning I cold still smell it on my shirt at the end of the night. The only thing I did not like was that the golden cap was on so tight that I actually pulled off the bottom piece when trying to get the lid off, other than that I really like this perfume.

4.0,Fruity,"This Lady Passion For Women, Eau De Parfum is supposed to be inspired By Paris Hilton perfume, however i do not have that perfume so I really can not describe the difference. However, I can tell you that this Lady Passion perfume smells nice. It has a very distinct citrus smell, almost grapefruity type smell. Its nice on the nose but not really my favorite kind of scent when I want to wear a perfume. It comes in a very large 3.3 Fl. Oz./100 ml glass bottle that should last you a while, however I did notice that the scent dissipated quite dramatically from me as the day went on and if I wanted to keep the good smell to be continuously noticeable I would have to reapply, but its price is very affordable. It comes with an easy push squirt application nozzle.

5.0,Be careful with these tools if you dont know how to use them.,"Its one of the grossest things in the world, blackheads. But lets face it, some of us women are so fascinated by them! We love to pop and pull and squeeze and get all the gunk out of not only our faces, but our spouses. Eeeewww. Until not long ago I did not realize how much popping pimples is so bad for your skin! Leaves holes and scarring and no wonder I have such big pores... So after learning that I was so excited to try out this Deluxe Premium Blackhead & Blemish Remover Kit by Mac Professional. This set comes with so many different tools its hard to know where to start. There is one tool in particular that is the coolest, though a bit dangerous. It has two heads that screw into each side for safety and can be removed and screwed on the sides, and has a lancet and another head. Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece.

5.0,The best treatment I have found for my wiry beard to make it soft and manageable for hours,"I got this free and when they say a man sized bottle they were not kidding this is 10 times larger than the oil I bought to shave with and ounce for ounce this is less expensive and just as good.  I woke up this morning and even after a shower my beard was stiff and itchy.  I used about 4 drops of this oil massaged into my hands and then the beard and the beard became soft and the itching was gone.  Several hours later when I usually am getting an uncomfortable feeling from by beard, there is no discomfort the beard feels just as good as it did right after I used this oil.  If you have a short beard like me this is a great product and I would recommend it to even Uncle Si from Duck Commander with the big beard he and the rest of the family have.  This product can make an unmanageable beard manageable.  I am not getting paid for this review and I just believe in the product from using it.  I believe even my sons-in-law would benefit from this product especially when my granddaughter doesn't want to kiss me or her dad because our beards are scratchy.  With this product the scratchy beard is no longer a problem.  Women if you have a problem with your guy's beard I recommend that you buy this for him as a gift both of you will be pleased and if you want to make him really happy massage his beard with this and watch what he will do for you.",[],B01CUPHRQM,B01CUPHRQM,AGRS5QPP6ECAQUCGVGCL3CO3PFCQ,1466190866000,0,False

I tried it on with an old t-shirt on so it wouldn't matter. To get a good application, squeeze a nice amount out then smear it on. You then get the luxury of waiting at least 10 minutes. I waited 30 for it to dry. Then you get to peel. Before peeling, pat your lips to make sure it's dry. You can try to peek it off in one swoop but I didn't. Once it comes off, your lips are lighter than the original application. It looks nice.. Well some colors look nice. I am African American so not all colors look great on me. Pretty much the lighter the color, the less likely to really show up. It does last though. It's more matte to me.

5.0,"The ""Dirty Brown"" is good match for Ash Brown. If you like a messy look, this is a good choice","My natural hair color is light to medium Ash Brown, depending on how manufacturers label their colors.  (Unfortunately, there's not alot of uniformity in the industry when it comes to color labels).  I look for #8 if the color number is given.  Even then, you can NEVER be sure unless you see it in person, and Ash Brown is particulary hard to find.  The picture of the ""Dirty Brown"" bun looked to be a close match to my hair, but the pictures often lie, too,....and ""Dirty Brown""??  In all my searches for ash brown hair pieces, this is the first ""Dirty Brown"" color label I've come across. I took a chance, and it is ALMOST a perfect match to my hair color.  Even though it doesn't say that the Dirty Brown piece is ombre dyed, IT IS, and the lighter ends would not be my choice. Still, the darker ""roots"" of the piece are almost perfectly matched to mine, so I think I can pass it off as real.  I have very fine hair, and I do NOT like thick hair pieces. That's another hard thing to find,....hair pieces that aren't unrealistically thick and ""weighty""!  This piece is full, but not TOO full, not so thick that it looks fakey or heavy.  The ""messy"" feature is definitely very messy, the hair is completely straight and a bit spiky looking, yet very soft to the touch.  The center opening is too big, the elastic to loose for me to wear it over my own ponytail or bun without additional fasteners.  I use a couple hidden bobby pins at the top of the piece to secure it to my own hair.  It's easy to do and unnoticeable but can sometimes get a little heavy and ""pulling"" if worn for hours.  I change the position of the bobby pins, move them off to the sides, if it starts to bother me, so it's not a deal breaker.  This messy bun (more like a mess pony) is very well suited for around home, when running errands, or for any casual event with casual dress.  I don't think it would work well (and I would not choose it) for more formal events or dressier attire.  I really, really like this piece!  95% of my life is ""casual"", and I know I'll get alot of wear out it.  These things don't last forever, so when I find an affordable piece that matches my natural hair color and my life style, I usually go back and get a ""spare"".  That's a winner in my world, and this one got a medal, so I'm back to buy the spare!",[],B08B83H5NQ,B08B83H5NQ,AFBOHXRGHO3LQ2PYOB5URT5XESFQ,1596152497894,1,True

I should have listened to my instincts.<br /><br />Let me put it bluntly. This contraption does not work in ANY way as advertised.

The point of this toy is to not have to bend over to scrub the dirt or smooth out the calluses on your feet. But since it won't stay put, there is nothing easy about cleaning your feet with this thing.<br /><br />Since the suction cups didn't stick to the floor, I tried jamming the thing in a corner and holding it there with my other foot. But even if you can get it to stay still enough to rub your foot on the brush, the bristles are weak and cheap. They flattened out with the third attempted use. The stone is small and even more useless than the brush.<br /><br />This is the perfect example of a sucker product! Wouldn't it be great if this worked? But it doesn't.

I also use them to keep my hair drying bonnet from opening up due to the air pressure.  And, I use them to hold my towel closed.  BUT, oftentimes, the silicone breaks.  So, I wanted a large quantity to help make up for this.  So, I deducted a star due to the lack of durability of the silicone - once it breaks, the hold feels much, much firmer.

3.0,Does not feel like it can straighten hair at the roots but love the low heating temp.,"I have tried a number of these brushes.  What I like about this one is that it goes down to 80C (176F).  It was so cool that I was not sure it was on.  I have fine hair, high porosity that is 5 months post-straightening relaxer.  And, I find that light heat with a silicone-based glosser helps to gently close the cuticle and to keep my roots from tangling.  What I don’t like is that this brush design does not have the round guiding bristles around the edges that help to pull your hair into the hearing plate.  So, it feels like you are brushing your hair with your elbow and that it is not penetrating to the roots.  You have to grip the hair with your other hand so it feels like you are only getting the shaft of your hair.  So, the brush is best for people with longer hair who do not have curly roots or those who need the super low heat setting as an option.<br /><br />If you would like to be able to rake the brush over your roots to tame curls at 250 F and up, other bushes  to consider are https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FGV9NQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071HFQGJX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

5.0,Very Effective in Healing and Clearing Skin,"I cannot say enough good things about this Retinol Serum. I have tried several things from the Baebody line of products, and they have all been very high quality and very effective. I am a huge fan of Retinol and how it benefits the skin. I am at a crappy age where I still get breakouts, and I am starting to get wrinkles. I hate having the same gross skin as I did as a teenager. And I have tried everything! Prescription meds, prescription creams, ProActiv, micro-dermabrasion, chemical peels, etc,etc. Nothing seemed to help until I started using this Retinol Serum. Retinol is just a fancy word for Vitamin A and apparently me skin is in desperate need of it. It acts on DNA to promote healthy epidermal skin cells. It does a great job of moisturizing my skin, which helps with wrinkles. And it also does a great job of preventing breakouts. If I do break out because of hormones, it helps clear them up without drying out my skin. Sometimes it clears up my skin within a day or overnight. Vitamin A is a really potent antioxidant that protects your skin from free radicals, generates cell growth, and repairs damaged cells. Retinol belongs to a family called retinoids, and is one of the only substances that is small enough to penetrate the outer epidermal layer to the layer where collagen and elastin reside. It is really strong at first. It is really effective and it is tempting to want to use too much too often, but it can end up irritating the skin. I started using it every other day at first and then built up to using it every day. I also like to use a Vitamin C serum, but using Vitamin C and Retinol together tends to decrease their effectiveness. And sunlight decreased the effectiveness of Retinol, so I use the Vitaming C serum in the morning and the Retinol Serum at night. I let it work it's magic while I sleep. It has helped clear up my skin and help heal sun spots and acne scars. My only regret about it is that I didn't start using this years ago! I was able to try this Retinol Serum at a promotional discount for testing and reviewing purposes and in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",[],B01EJ3C5OM,B01EJ3C5OM,AFLTT7DDWVQXXNA6ASQLE3Z4RVTQ,1465132537000,12,False

1.0,"Deceptive, and cheap.","I am so very disappointed with this product line by Amorepacific. I love their other brands, IOPE and sulwhasoo. But I was in the search for a more affordable toner/emulsion/serum and was excited when they introduced this line and gave a discount. They really sold this beta-hyaluronic whatever that works 1.5x better and I thought it was a new patented technology. But no. Contrary to their marketing claim, there is no such thing as beta hyaluronic acid.  Yes I looked up patent registry and trademark registry and Amorepacific didn’t register anything new in the past few years related to hyaluronic acid. They just put a new spin on beta glucan, which according to some studies works 20% better, not 150% like they claim. Also beta glucan is toward the end of the ingredient list, meaning we have no idea how much of it is even in there. It’s so disappointing that Amorepacific decides to just flat out lie to customers about it. Makes me go wonder what else they are lying about.<br /><br />Now I would not have done all the research if the serum worked well in the first place. But it came with no safety seal which made me go um. The packaging felt cheap. The liquid felt cheap and diluted. My skin smelled like plastic. My skin didn’t stay hydrated like other serums and that’s when I knew something was up. I bought toner, emulsion and serum. The emulsion was sealed but the toner and serum was not. I didn’t even bother trying the emulsion. I’ll be returning these all. I will also be seeking new skincare products that are not made by Amorepacific.

3.0,"No difference after three weeks of consistent use, and product won't dispense through pump.","ANOTHER UPDATE:<br /><br />My dermatologist told me that unless a Vitamin C serum contained the L-ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C, I was wasting my money and doing little to improve my skin.  I found a serum here on Amazon that contains 17% L-ascorbic acid, and I've been using it for approx. 3 weeks.  What a difference!  I can definitely feel it working for one thing (it burns for about 5 seconds), but more importantly, I can SEE the difference in my skin already.  At first I thought my eyesight was going downhill, but then I realized my skin really did look smoother and had a new glow.  Do an Amazon search for L-ascorbic Vitamin C serum to get the good stuff.<br /><br />Having said all this, I have added a LOT more spinach to my daily regimen lately, so I'm sure that's contributing to my skin's appearance too.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finished the bottle which gave me about 5 weeks of use.  If it made any difference in my skin, it's at a microscopic level.  I'm buying another bottle - mainly because there's got to be SOME truth to all the 5-star reviews.  But if, after another month or so of use, I still don't see improvement in my skin, I'm asking a dermatologist for a Rx for Retin-A.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I've been using this product for three weeks, and I have yet to see any improvement in my skin.  I'm amazed (and not a little skeptical) about some people seeing results in two weeks.  I also wonder how many 5-star reviews were written by people who were given the product to try.<br /><br />I'm very methodical about using new products on my skin.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror, establish a &#34;baseline&#34; area of my skin to observe over time, and take close-up &#34;selfies&#34; of my skin to compare with photos taken a few weeks later.  No difference so far, but I'll continue to use this product until it's gone.<br /><br />I DO like that this retinol doesn't irritate my skin, which is highly unusual.  So unusual, it makes me wonder if it indeed contains any retinol.<br /><br />In conclusion, and not a critique of the product itself, but the product won't dispense through the pump.  It's too thick.  I'm having to pull the cap off and shake the serum on to my fingertips. I wish it came with a dropper instead.  I changed out out the pump with a dropper from another bottle of serum.  I'm surprised I haven't read about this problem in other reviews. Another reason I'm leery of all the glowing comments.<br /><br />I'll update with my progress, or lack thereof, at a later date.",[],B00NT0AR7E,B00NT0AR7E,AEAJBHE5KH74FQG2U4WJVGACT7PA,1428935935000,1,True

This has actually been confirmed by our doctor who then measured our heads and said it was genetic. :)  That being said, we have a hard time finding bows that actually fit her.  These are just now starting to get a bit tight and causing some indent marks. The colors are really wonderful and go with just about everything. We get a lot of complements on her bows. With her light hair, I will say that the black one tends to look like a pirate patch but other than that they are great.  Not to mention the price was phenomenal. I seem to not find single bows for under six bucks when at retail stores.<br /><br />Oh, in case anyone is wondering, they come with little felt backs, and they were packaged in a clear envelope of sorts with a little sticker from the seller.

4.0,It works.,"Depending on the saturation of your color it does the job well enough. I needed it to get out green. I'm on the 2nd treatment and will need one or two more. Green is the worst to get out it seems. But originally it was supposed to be a blue teal but it immediately went to green. I tried a lot of different things since the hair dressers near me have been booked solid for 2 months now.<br />So this stuff works, be patient, leave on more than 20min. The directions are sooo tiny. Mix both together, same amount each bottle. Mix into hair. Leave on 20 to 40minutes.

5.0,I am so in love 😍,"It was package d to perfection. I wanted to upgrade my vanity mirror on the vanity I already have, so I order (black). It is very sturdy. It does not slide off a my glass vanity, because of the non- skid material on the bottom of the mirror. I love that it comes with two extra replacement bulbs. I only took a picture of it without the lights on. Trust me, the lights are beautiful at each setting. The touch screen works great, make sure you 🔌 plug the mirror into a secure wall outlet and that it is in there nice and tight. I am telling you this because one bulb seemed to be on a different setting at one point. I am so glad they included a dust cloth and bonus magnifying mirror.

I've used Waterpiks off and on over the years and always had good results.  The downside was always the container that had to be stored on the counter top.<br /><br />After using this for several weeks I can say that it is very handy and works well.  The handle is fairly large and much bigger  and  heavier than a Waterpik handle which took a bit of getting used to.  In general I would say its a bit of a draw between the two with the edge going to the Sonicare for the ability to clean it and store it quickly without taking up any counter space.<br /><br />All in this kit is also less expensive than buying the pieces separately.

5.0,Fantastic competitor for clean chemical free hygiene!,"5 stars! Fantastic competitor for clean chemical free hygiene!<br /><br />Works great for me!<br /><br />The only gripe is the container/tube can be a little tricky to operate, but apparently i was doing it wrong so squeezing on the inner sleeve and pushing up better than inverting it and pushing it through the hole in the bottom of the outer sleeve (which I was doing). My incorrect way, could potentially make things easier if the packaging was slightly redesigned so the lip of  the outer sleeve could fully encompass the product as it's pushed out if like me it's kinda stiff to squeeze out without using the rest of the packaging as a tool. Secondly, the cap is not deep enough, just another 5mm would do.<br /><br />I now use this alternating with my [[ASIN:B000F8K8AE Earth Science Deodorant - Liken Plant Unscented 2.45 oz.]]. The best fragrance free deodorants I can find! There are some other pretty awesome brands out there, but they don't offer fragrance free / chemical free last I checked. Cleanest thing I could find! Thank you!<br /><br />Apparently, the  the sunflower oil IS expeller pressed (sweet!), and the product is no longer made with castor oil! Some packages apparently still have it on there however.<br /><br />I just looked it up and apparently castor not safe for the workers... unless of course you're sourcing it from somewhere with massive labor / workplace safety regulations and the manufacturer is supplying the necessary equipment... which of course not the way most castor oil is made in the world... so it's fantastic that Gaia Guy decided not to put it in here anymore!<br /><br />Cheers!",[],B072ZQK9ZP,B072ZQK9ZP,AGBJMRERY5NMQ75EDRKJ4TJQTR7Q,1531432689264,1,True

That is, they will stick to your face (I've had these while walking around), but won't have product dripping down your neck. The solution is scented but not overly, and is not slimy as most masks, but will definitely tone/tighten your skin. I use these for 10min and they will remain there for that amount of time, but the edges will start to peel off after about 5 to 7min. I use these every other day.

However, her toenails have lasted 2 or 3 days.  The polish is easily washed off of skin and I can also easily scrape it off with my finger nail.  I have not tried to take it off with alcohol like they have recommended.  After seeing the reviews about the cap and wand coming apart, I do make an effort to clean around the polish top and around the wand after each use.  The polish top can be cleaned just by picking off the old polish with your fingernail and the wand I just wipe a wet paper towel around it.

5.0,"Love this razer, just like I loved the previous model (same razer)","Summary: Nothing not to like!<br /><br />Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the ""Speed-XL"" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br /><br />Why this razer is good:<br />The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br /><br />Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br />The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br />The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br />Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br /><br />That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br />This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br /><br />All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.",[],B0009MFUOA,B0009MFUOA,AGJNM4JNLYNTT6N7VPOXUWM2PB4A,1221927204000,1,True

The 5 magnet type never worked after I tried to cut them to the right size because there was never a magnet on the end, which made it impossible to get them to stay on without using glue. I found these with 10 smaller magnets and thought I would give them a try! I was able to cut them to the right size and still have magnets on both ends, so they would stay on. I am not very good at applying liquid liner, but I was able to get this liner to work just fine. I used these for my wedding and they stayed on all day/evening and weren't too heavy feeling like some lashes. They really made my eyes pop and stand out beautifully in pictures!  In the photos, the close ups were before the wedding to try them out, and although the one end wouldn't stay on that time, I was able to get it to stay on the wedding day.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like (which is the same with all of these magnetic liners) is that the liner is difficult to remove. The lashes themselves came off fine, but the liner was not easy to remove (from my skin or the lashes). I don't like to use makeup removers, so I used coconut oil. It took some time to get it off. But I don't think that's anything specific to this liner, it's the magnetic liners in general.<br /><br />I recommend these lashes over all of those 5 magnet ones!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gnkPm+msL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gnkPm+msL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gnkPm+msL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jji+z7GtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jji+z7GtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jji+z7GtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFmN2apkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFmN2apkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFmN2apkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xH2hQhxnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xH2hQhxnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xH2hQhxnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08Q76S3MS,B08Q76S3MS,AEASREL4ZDAI7OAYLS7YOVJUXASA,1614968643433,3,True

It was a tough choice between the lesser model and the one with the vacuum/turbo.<br /><br />I exchanged the crappy one for this one and found its capabilities supersede my needs, and then some.  I could probably trim the hedges with this thing.  The vacuum is also very impressive.  I assumed I'd be sweeping half my body hair off the floor (yeah, ""bodyhair"" trimmers don't actually do what I want them to, so I use beard trimmers.  Most people that I know do, too).<br /><br />So, what's the drawback?  The setting doesn't stay put.  Unless you old it by the setting dial, it'll slip down with even the slightest pressure.  It's pathetic.  The box says something about setting ""lock"", but that's just a norelco company inside joke.",[],B000FEF1V4,B000FEF1V4,AEFRS7QNX3JELZQR5HKDZKZTFRCQ,1216868333000,1,False
4.0,Allowed me to stop using styling products,"I have fine hair and I've always had trouble with it getting frizzy and poofy.

Since I don't need to add any products it feels and looks better. The Tea Tree blend worked better on soothing my dry scalp than the Cucumber Aloe that I originally tried (got it as a gift).<br /><br />It's definitely worth the price, but I would give it 5 stars if it were a little more affordable.

5.0,"light, floral lavender","Lavender is my #1 go-to essential oil. I think I use it in 90% of my blends, whether in the diffuser or in topical blends (or sprays, etc). The only thing I definitely don’t use it for is my home-made cleaning products where citrus oils are the only essential oils.<br /><br />This particular oil is a very delicate scent – some lavender oils can pack quite a punch in terms of the scent. This is certainly floral and has a ‘high note’ to it. You can easily pick it out of a blend. It’s my first oil from New York Biology and I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I love blending lavender in particular with chamomile, as it has an almost instantaneous calming effect. Also love to blend it with bergamot, ylang ylang, mandarin, and a drop of lime.<br /><br />The bottle is very large, a dark brown color to protect the oil from UV rays which can damage the oils and decrease the shelf life. My favorite way to dispense oils is with the eye dropper (the euro droppers found in smaller bottles tend to gush several drops at once, so that’s definitely not my preference) – you can really control how many drops you dispense with these eye droppers.<br /><br />Arrived well protected in bubble wrap and there was no leaks.<br /><br />* I received the oil for evaluation and review",[],B01IG41ZG4,B01IG41ZG4,AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q,1474824730000,0,False
4.0,enjoying this - great in tandem with a thick skin cream,"My mother asked me to find her a moisturizer with matrixxyl and peptides. Very specific and she didn’t want anything that did not have at least those two ingredients.<br /><br />The reason is a conversation with her dermatologist. Matrixxyl is made of 2 peptides, palmitoyl-tripeptide and palmitoyl-oligopeptide, which stimulate collagen and elastin production in the skin. And peptides form a long chain of amino acids to become proteins, penetrating the top layer of skin cells and signaling the cells including collagen.<br /><br />The Cazbe serum works really nicely in tandem with my mom’s Ponds cream (she has used Ponds as long as I remember). The serum absorbs pretty rapidly and unlike other serums, doesn’t seem to leave her skin feeling sort of ‘tight’ or dry. After a few minutes (she will put the serum on before brushing her teeth, and then follow with moisturizer after teeth), she will apply the Ponds cream to completely moisturize her face. I’ve tried this a few times and find I can only really use it around my eyes – it dries out my cheeks and chin. If used just around my eyes, it feels a lot better.<br /><br />Her skin is looking beautiful. I think in combination with a really solid cream to sort of ‘seal in’ the benefits, after washing your face, and just before bed, it’s a great part of your beauty routine.<br /><br />* we received the serum for evaluation and review",[],B01699WMHO,B01699WMHO,AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q,1474743988000,0,False
5.0,Another winner from Majestic Pure,"I have many Majestic Pure products (from skin care products, to hair care, to essential oils), and have always been very satisfied. I am also pleased with the retinol cream. Having very sensitive skin, I tend to use products containing retinol quite sparingly (aka, every few days, vs. daily) as they tend to cause my skin to become quite irritated or scaly after a few days of daily use. I’ve been using this around just my eyes every evening (about 1 hour after applying a hyaluronic acid serum), as my skin is so sensitive that using anything with retinol on my entire face seems to really cause a lot of scaliness. And, this is where the fine lines are really beginning to show.<br /><br />The results – after using a cream with retinol in combination with hyaluronic acid serum for 3 weeks, I’ve been noticing a definite reduction in the fine lines. They are still there but they were becoming really noticeable.<br /><br />The cream has ingredients that are highly moisturizing (again, which I like to follow up on a serum with). The consistency is pretty thin (not thick and creamy like a lotion), and there is no noticeable fragrance. It seems to absorb quickly and is not oily.<br /><br />Some note on the ingredients:<br /><br />Retinol 2.5% - Retinol is another name for Vitamin A, which is an antioxidant (helps reverse the damage caused by free radicals, apparent in wrinkles and aging), encourages the production of collagen, and elastin.<br />Jojoba Oil - closely resembles sebum (a waxy substance produced by our skin glands), packed with vitamins and minerals - Vitamin E, B, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine and chromium.<br />Green Tea - Tea is high in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, whether ingested or applied topically. Green tea contains tannins which can reduce puffiness and inflammation of the skin. It also contains polyphenols, which can combat free radicals (which contribute to aging). The catechins in tea can combat the bacteria that contribute to acne.<br />Propolis - Propolis, “bee glue or bee penicillin” is the resinous material gathered by honeybees from flowers and leaf buds of various plants. It contains dozens of anti-oxidants,<br />Shea Butter - The moisturizers in shea butter are similar to those produced by the skin’s sebaceous glands, making it one of the best choices for super-dry or cracked skin. Shea butter also contains anti-inflammatory compounds – great for applying to inflamed or irritated skin (think eczema, chapped skin, bug bites)<br />Vitamin B5 - A humectant (a water-binding substance that attracts and retains water). Particularly good for the skin as it stabilizes the skin barrier, increasing hydration and improving softness and elasticity.<br />Vitamin E - A powerful antioxidant, that neutralizes the oxidant effect of free radicals, which are molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles<br /><br />*I received the retinol cream for evaluation and review","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mIjZcSuLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mIjZcSuLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mIjZcSuLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dj3zQYALL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dj3zQYALL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dj3zQYALL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00VXEQ0WO,B00VXEQ0WO,AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q,1463189525000,2,False

5.0,My skin feels good - not greasy. It's easy to dispense from the bottle. And 2 compliments from friends after using it for 1 week,"I bought this to begin (and win!) the fight against the wrinkles that are appearing around my eyes (crow's feet). I guess the best solution is not to laugh, but then what fun would life be...<br /><br />What is Hyaluronic acid? According to WebMD, &#34;Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues. In addition, it might affect the way the body responds to injury.&#34;<br /><br />(+) Does it work? I've used the Hyaluronic serum every night for a week now. Not sure if I can say 100% that I have noticed no fine lines around my eyes, but I've had 2 friends remark that my skin is looking great. As we women know, that's a good endorsement right there.<br /><br />(+) Texture: As you can see in the photo, the Derma-nu serum is a clear, slightly viscous consistency that goes on clear. You can feel it on your skin for quite a few minutes afterwards. It does NOT leave your skin feeling greasy (big pet peeve of mine) when you wake up in the morning.<br /><br />(+) Smell: This is not a scented beauty product. There is a very slight almost medicinal scent - that's the best way to describe it. It is not unpleasant, it is extremely mild, but it smells like it has some ingredients that 'have a purpose', vs. beauty products that have fragrances added.<br /><br />(+) Packaging and ease of use: The pump is well made - it dispenses a small amount of serum, which I am finding is enough for applying to the corners of both eyes. I'm having to &#34;prime&#34; the pump about 2-3 times before it dispenses the serum, so be careful, you don't want to double pump the serum unless you are OK putting possibly 2x the amount on your face than you might have intended.<br /><br />(+) A little goes a long way. I travel a lot, so the compact bottle and efficient dispensing from the pump are bonuses for me.<br /><br />(/) Organic. The bottle indicates that 72% of the ingredients are organic. It doesn't clarify which of the ingredients are/are not organic. It would be nice to see this get to 100%.<br /><br />Bottom line: So far, my skin has felt good, I've had a few compliments, and I'm pleased with the way Derma-nu packaged the Hyaluronic serum so that it is easy to dispense.<br /><br />*I received the serum for evaluation and review","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618SJecUtmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618SJecUtmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618SJecUtmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MQsQXdAwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MQsQXdAwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MQsQXdAwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QBA0TvLLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QBA0TvLLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QBA0TvLLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00OS9YWJY,B00OS9YWJY,AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q,1447624045000,9,False
4.0,"Great shave, great value - use with Letric Shave","I tried electric razors ten years ago with a Braun model but my skin was too sensitive and I received nicks and cuts and a poor shave.  Three years ago, I tried again with a Remington, and it worked great for my head -- not so great for my face.  Lots of nicks, and spread a rash. I was especially disappointed that it didn't get my neck very well. Both shavers were straight foil shavers, as I thought they would shave closer than round heads.<br /><br />Then, I purchased this Norelco over 2 months ago, and it has worked like a dream for me.  While the first week wasn't especially close, it was convenient as I was traveling for work.  By the third week, however, the shave was CLOSER than my regular Mach 3 blade shave!<br /><br />One huge difference: I bought some Letric Shave pre-shave liquid, which makes the whiskers stand up, and also disinfects the shaving heads. I haven't had one cut, and no rash, in over 60 shaves with this unit.  Since then, I have used the Norelco every morning, along with the Letric Shave, and have been thrilled with the results.  I have also wondered whether my previous experience with an electric would have been better had I $3.49 to get the pre-shave splash!<br /><br />I have to agree with one poster who complained about the plastic parts - the only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars.  I don't really know how long this unit will run.  I do know in 2 months, I have already saved more on this unit than disposable blades would have cost.  And, travel is a snap.

1.0,Literal Nightmare,"To preface my review this is my first attempt with at-home waxing & I'm Trans MTF. I've waxed plenty in my lifetime, but always at a salon by a professional. Now I'm sitting here typing this review with an incredibly thin layer of wax all way down my still very hairy left leg.<br /><br />I purchased the wax roughly 3 months ago, so I don't think the wax is expired, and it was stored in the original packaging in the meantime. I think the main issue is with the roller unit in general. I was literally pulling more hairs out just rolling the wax onto my leg than I was will the couple of strips I did manage to try. I don't have an issue with pulling hairs or anything. Tweezing nose hairs, or threading is WAY more painful and I don't have an issue with either of those.<br /><br />It took the unit forever to just warm up enough, instructions are laughable at best (broken unclear English), the included wax cleanup wipes are useless & dry (I'm about to google how to remove all this excess wax off my leg in a moment here). I feel if I could break open the unit and heat the wax over the stove it would work 100% better, but I don't want to risk my cookware.<br /><br />Update: #1: I was able to successfully microwave the cartridge for 3 mins in a bowl of water. 5 minutes would likely work better for you as my cartridge was still warm when I started. The wax rolled much nicer this time around, but still required some pulling, however it started to pool on one side of the roller resulting in the whole roller stopping again and even got a spot onto my bathroom rug that I had been carefully avoiding... The irritation from the wax is worse than using a depilatory cream (such as Nair)<br /><br />Update #2: After oven an hour of attempting to remove the wax with various products. (baby oil, oil-free makeup remover, acetone, rubbing alcohol, body wash, and finally olive oil in that order). The olive oil and now trashed white washcloth finally did the trick. I really can't recommend avoiding this product enough.

Battery is not included.<br /><br />I thought the ridges of the heating element would be longer to act as more of a comb. They are not.

Product was as described & shipped<br />quickly. I have used this product 3 x since receiving. Basically this is traditional pan make up in a tube. It's very thick & quite greasy on its own. I have tried to make good use of Dermacol, unfortunately no matter how I prep/prime/set/apply this make up broke down within in 3 hrs. My skin is normal with an occasional  break out. I have not experienced any break outs. I feel this product is truly for stage/photo use. The amount needed for &#34;full&#34; coverage would be akin to literally wearing a mask. The product did not blend & basically sat on top of the skin. As it breaks down it becomes a thin, speckled look. Primer, setting powder nor spray made a difference. Then it settles in ALL your fine lines & imperfections. It's a hard pass for me. I would like to also add, the promos with product covering tatoos etc is just hype.

5.0,Good Value for Your Money With Pleasing Results,"I bought this product, the Neutrogena Wave because I wanted to take my skincare regimin to the next level. I looked at the competetors but settled on this product due to the price of $12.97 at Walmart. It comes with the massager, pop-out attachment for the cleansing pad,(14) and a AA battery along with 14 cleansing pads. First, let me say I'm in my fifty's so skincare is important to me but I don't have the luxury of spending hundreds on skincare products. My skin is now starting to show signs of aging by fine lines and deep wrinkles and circles under my eyes. My main goal from this product is for my skin to improve in the following areas:<br /><br />more even skin texture<br />more radiance<br />more firmness<br />more softer, subtle feel<br />help with deep skin cleansing and exfoliation<br /><br />  I used this product today for the first time following the instructions carefully. The product is very well made so far as the size as it comfortably fits in your palm. The attachment which holds the cleanser pad comes of easily and the cleansing pad attachs to it with no problems. Simply wet the pad with some water and push the button to start.You can also re- wet the pad if more is needed later. The vibration is both somewhat quiet but not irritating on the skin at all. You don't need to push on the product while holding it as it does the massaging for you!! The cleansing pads have a nice smell to them- nothing too perfumy, just a nice clean smell. Simply guide the skin massager over your face concentrating on the areas that you feel need the most attention. You control how long you feel each area needs to be cleansed.<br />  I found my skin afterward to be more soft and brighter than before I used the Neutrogena Wave. It was easy to use and control and can ber used in the shower. The cleansing pads are available for about $6.49 for about 1-2 months worth depending on how often you use the product. It is gentle enough I feel you could use it every day depending on yourt skin type.<br />  Bottom line is, if you don't want to spend alot for a ""skin rejuvenator"" than consider the Neutrogena Wave! I think you'll like the results and for alot less too!!",[],B0011TI8TO,B0011TI8TO,AGYOYIHQZEWC4L7R3DW3NWTQIZGQ,1225753689000,4,False

5.0,Love this wand!,"I'm not going to lie and say using this particular wand was not time consuming...it definitely was, but the results are worth it.  I have very long hair, so wrapping was a bit of a struggle because the wand is only so long.  I was able to wrap around both the balls and the indents, giving a unique curl effect.  Works best to physically unwrap the strand of hair you're curling rather than pulling downward as with a traditional clipless wand.  Any reviews stating this wand does not give curl either has too short of hair, isn't using a high enough heat setting, or is completely doing it wrong.  You really need to use your right hand over your head to curl the left and vice versa for the right.  The black cool tip should be pointing downward as you curl.  There are some informative videos on YouTube for how to curl with this wand.  Anyhow, I'm pleased with this wand and look forward to many great looks from it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zbLnvgbIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zbLnvgbIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zbLnvgbIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D+LaweOeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D+LaweOeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71D+LaweOeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uAz+l9AML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uAz+l9AML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uAz+l9AML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0092MCQZ4,B01M1OFZOG,AGTTGCXJORUC2HZZKL2OSSBJEM3A,1505526979762,47,True

3.0,Skeptical,"Ok sooo I don’t know about this one. Clear vitamin C means it is 100% potent, but having an ingredient list that potency is no longer 100%. So upon seeing clear thick serum I was skeptical. Soon as I opened the bottle I added several drops to a small old bottle I own and left it open exposing to air, lights and anything else that causes oxidizing to the vitamin c. It stayed clear. After one week straight no changes. I even popped into the microwave for 8 seconds still clear. Had it contained ferulic acid I would have been less skeptic because FA is a Vitamin C stabilizer. On its own Vitamin C (L-absorbic acid) is unstable and begins to oxidize once the seal is broken. Yes even pure vitamin C in water it will turn a slight yellow and begin to darken.<br /><br />But my skin did not break out a good thing. Even if it doesn’t contain vitamin c the other ingredients are a plus especially glycerin as the second ingredient ... which is a natural humectant, anti microbial and antiviral all meaning moisturized skin that won’t get clogged and controls acne. I do get acne (thank the skin gurus) but I do chemical exfoliate with acids and use a retinol. Two things that cause dry skin. If I should break out from a product then it is pure trash and the PH is way off.<br /><br />So it has it pluses and minuses.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Vg2X77iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Vg2X77iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Vg2X77iL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GPMbRY7ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GPMbRY7ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GPMbRY7ML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JRFH7UsyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JRFH7UsyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JRFH7UsyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j64lBNEsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j64lBNEsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61j64lBNEsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07BJ2N1HY,B07BJ2N1HY,AGGCJJJDYV424QPQUJC6IX7RE4JA,1597294066263,3,True

Another reason why I won't buy them again is that it's difficult to get just one wipe at a time out of the container.

Also, for famillies, all you have to do is buy more heads because everyone can use this.

5.0,Equal to the expensive Salon brands,I normally use Salon shampoos because over the counter regular shampoos just dry out my hair. My hair has been colored and permed for years so if I use regular cheap shampoos my hair gets really dry and looks like straw. I decided to try this because I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion** This Argan Oil Shampoo has an amazing scent and is thick which allows you to use less of it at once even with long hair. I have long slightly curly hair which means I tend to use a lot of shampoo and as you may know leaves a nice hole in my pocketbook. This shampoo also has a pump dispenser which is much easier to use in the shower and allows you to get the right amount out. The shampoo is thicker than any shampoo I've used before and I really like the way it feels in my hair and because it's thicker you don't have to use as much of it; I only used about one squirt from the pump and it covered my entire hair. I would definitely recommend this Argan Oil Shampoo! My hair was really soft after use and feels good not dry.,[],B012Q9NGE4,B012Q9NGE4,AFZ5GFZD6KK5PQU5X5ER4AKMXPMQ,1450759496000,0,False

5.0,A Very Good Electric Shaver for Sensitive Skin,"As someone with very sensitive skin, I have always had problems with razor burn after shaving. Dry electric shavers tend to butcher my skin.  Traditional multi-blade razors (like the Mach 3) are easier on my skin, but as sensitive as my skin is, cuts are not uncommon.  A few months ago I received a Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive In/Out of Shower Shaver as a gift and gave it a try.  Thanks to the shaving gel that can be applied to the skin at the touch of a button while shaving, it provides a very close shave that doesn't cut my skin like a traditional razor, and there's very little skin irritation afterwards.  As for closeness, I'd say that it's almost as good as a Mach 3 razor.<br /><br />One aspect about this shaver that I like is that it operates from a rechargeable battery so that there's no electric cord to get in the way while shaving.  Also, the shaving gel packets are easy to replace, it comes with a charger stand, it's easy to clean the rotating blades and it takes up little bathroom counter space.  Further, it takes less time to shave and clean-up afterwards than with a traditional razor & shaving cream.<br /><br />Overall, I regard the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive In/Out of Shower Shaver as a very good shaver and rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  Granted, it is somewhat expensive, but if you have very sensitive skin like me, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was with its performance.",[],B0001HYKBM,B0001HYKBM,AF3O6MMTBRDPO2SVTSEK6YLZVHPQ,1129253143000,10,False

5.0,Nice set,"I have four daughters aged 6,5,4 and 11 months. So we can truly never have enough bows. Every chance I'm given to try new ones, I take it. So I of course ordered these when I seen them. Upon arrival I was very pleased with them. I absolutely loved the packaging especially the box the bows arrived in, which can be used for storage when not in use.  We took them out right away and couldn't have been happier. These bows are made very well and seem to be very sturdy. The colors/design are very nice and put together well. The colors are great and they should definitely match with anything you may need. The ribbon on these is of nice quality and it shows. They are infact the size mentioned in the add, which can sometimes be a surprise upon arrival. They are on alligator clips, which was exactly what we were wanting. These particular clips have grips on them which make them even easier. They stay in place with no problems, even during rough play. One of the best things about these is that they are very light weight. Lighter than most of our bows, especially for the size. These have a soft of silky-ness to them which I have found helps tremendously when trying to clean them. I use a baby wipe and have no issues wiping off anything that has managed to get on them. I'm so glad I found these and we were able to try them out. I have  no doubt that they will last a while to come, being they are made so well. I'm completely happy with my purchase and I will be recommending them to my friends and family.

5.0,"The Real ""Miracle In A Jar"" For Me!","I've been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!<br /><br />I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new ""Simply Radiant"" skin care system with fancy ""Soy Proteins"" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.<br /><br />I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch ""shine"" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared.

5.0,take good care of the internal battery,"I bought this trimmer two months ago.  I use it to keep my hair very short.  I have not gone to a barber ever since I bought this.  I simply turn the dial to set the guard to level 5 and cut all of my hair the same lenght.  Definitely easy to use.  On my short hair, I can probably get four complete haircuts in one charge.  This is a good trimmer for those men who like to keep their hair very short all the way around.  Use it two times and it would have paid for itself due to the fact that you were able to avoid going to a barber.<br />This is my second Norelco trimmer.  My first one was a T6000 that I bought back in February of 2001.  The battery stopped taking a charge four months ago, after almost 3 years of use.  I called Norelco to have the battery replaced, and I was then informed that they do not replace the batteries on these trimmers since replacing the battery would cost as much as buying a newer unit.  So, I ordered the newer T860 from Amazon.  The T860 functions just like the older T6000.  In addition, the T860 can also function as a corded trimmer, in the event the battery stops taking a charge.  The service life of the trimmer can extend beyond the life of the rechargeable battery by using the cord.  I am satisfied with it.<br />By the way, the reason why the battery got damaged in my older T6000 was that I kept the unit plugged in the charger stand for very long periods of time.  I later learned not to do that, as that practice will damage the battery over time.  Overcharging even a little seems to damage the battery over time.  It's best to read the directions so you will know how to properly care for the battery.  The battery basically will determine the life of the unit.  The cutters do not wear out, from what I can tell.  The motor seems durable.  So the life of the unit is really how long you can keep the internal rechargeable battery working.  Norelco's internal rechargeable Ni-Cad batteries can last a long time, if given proper care.  They seem to be of good quality.<br />I had a Norelco 885 razor, and the battery was still taking a charge after nine years.  The razor had the advantage of having a five level battery meter that tells you how much charge is left in the internal batteries.  Basically, you want to wait until there is only a little charge left before you put the unit in the charger.  It seems this trimmer is a bit different though.  The instructions on the T860 unit say to completely drain the battery.  Which would be a bit inconvenient.  With the T860 trimmer, it takes 10 hours for a full charge.  Recharge fully.  That way,  you can minimize the dreaded ""memory effect"" or voltage depression and extend the useful life of the rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeable batteries are permanently soldered inside the unit.  This trimmer unit, T860, does not have a charge meter.  I refrained from getting the pricier unit with a charge meter in order to economize.  However, my advice to you, if you're not too cost-sensitive, is to get a unit with a charge meter.  That way, you will know when to charge the unit and when to remove the unit from the charger.  That precise practice should help extend the life of the battery, and hence, the unit.",[],B000068PBR,B000068PBR,AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ,1077770771000,8,True
4.0,A Good Shaver from Norelco,"This is the latest shaver in Norelco's Quadra system.  The shaving heads are mounted in such a way that gives them the freedom to depress independently of one another, to better adapt to the unique contours of your face.  Another advantage to this razor is that the shaving heads can be washed under the faucet.  This is a feature that the Quadra system razors share with the more expensive Spectra system razors.<br />This razor is light-years better than my previous Norelco.  My last Norelco was the 885, bought back in 1991.  That razor always irritated my skin, especially the neck area.  Although it did last nine years.  Three years ago, I switched to the Braun Syncro system.  The Braun worked very well for me.  Anyway, I decided to give Norelco another try.  I was very surprised, and impressed, to say the least.  This Quadra shaves just as close and just as comfortable as the Braun Syncro.  And, it is very quiet.  So far, I am only getting 35 minutes of shaving time per charge.  But, I believe that the battery will reach its full capacity after a few more discharge and charge cycles.<br />For me, it is an even choice between this Norelco and the Braun.  I can readily recommend either one.  I suppose you just might have to try both and see which one will work better for you.  One thing is obvious though.  Either one will save you money in the long run, compared to using a blade shaver like the Mach 3, for example.  The long-term cost of periodically buying replacement blades for a Mach 3 or Sensor Excel can easily exceed the price of either one of the electrics.  I will admit, however, that neither of the electric razors can match the closeness of the Mach 3.",[],B000068PBL,B000068PBL,AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ,1075835579000,46,True

5.0,Foot Peel Mask,"I finally got around to using this.  I'm not sure why I was so scared of it.  Although, anything that's supposed to take the skin off your body should probably cause some trepidation.  That being said, test a little on your skin ahead of time to make sure you're not allergic, it's just good practice with new products.<br /><br />When using, it works exactly as intended and as described.  You follow the directions, put them on as instructed, and let them sit awhile.  Then, you wash your feet off and do your thing for a few days.  After that, you will gross yourself out with your nasty feet as the skin falls off in large, small, etc. pieces.  It takes a few days, but at the end it got most of my callouses off and my feet did feel smoother.  Now to just keep working at it.<br /><br />Review by M.

4.0,A Bit Difficult to Use but Produces Very Pretty Curls!,"For many years I've always straightened my hair because I cannot seem to get the hang of using curling irons to make pretty spiral curls. Wearing the same hairstyle all the time with long hair can get a bit boring so I decided to search on Amazon for styling tools that are easy to use. I initially ordered the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] and really loved the results so much that I also purchased this Rock 'n' Roller styling iron, which I affectionately call my &#34;bubble curler.&#34;<br /><br />The Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron comes with the iron itself along with a black protective glove to protect your hand from the heat of this iron since there is no clamp. The iron measures almost 15 inches in length, with the heating barrel measuring about 5 3/4 inches. The balls measure about one inch in diameter. The cord measures almost six feet so there is plenty of length to move around with it. The iron has a black ball at the top so you can hold it while using it, a safety stand that works well, an on/off switch, a temperature dial that allows you to choose among the low, medium, and high settings as well as the temperatures in between all of them, and a swivel cord so you can easily move the iron around as you use it. I found that it heats up quickly and cools off rapidly as well in case you need to pack it up in your suitcase soon after using it. The glove fits well but I didn't end up using it since it feels a bit awkward to use while trying to grip strands of hair so I took a chance and kept my hand bare, with no problems as long as I styled my hair in front of a mirror so I could watch closely what I was doing.<br /><br />I found this styling iron a bit difficult to use at first but it gets easier with practice. I just winged it and have included some pictures of my end result. There is a chart in the instructions as to what heat setting is most likely appropriate for your hair type but they recommend you start with the lowest setting and increase the heat as needed. I have wavy to medium hair so I started off using the low setting but ended up using the medium setting. I have long hair and it was fairly simple to wrap my hair around the barrel. When I got toward the end of the strands of hair, I carefully wrap them around the barrel, holding my fingers as close as I can to the styling iron without actually touching it. Then I roll the styling iron towards my head as close as I can so my hair gets curled as much as possible. I hold my hair in that position for about 40 seconds and then release it and curl my whole head. It probably took about a half hour to style all of my hair and then I finished by spraying it with hairspray. I didn't add any product to my hair before I started although you probably could if your hair works better that way.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this styling iron and really like the end result. Hopefully it will get easier to use with time. I found it a bit difficult to use because, without having a clamp on the iron, I had to hold both arms up in the air and my muscles got tired pretty quickly. I'm in fairly good shape but perhaps this will get easier with time. I actually prefer the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] because I feel it's easier to use and I love the beach waves I get from it so I will most likely use that one more but this one is still good to have. If you want spiral curls, I'd purchase the Rock 'n' Roller Styling Iron but if you prefer beach waves, I'd purchase the Deep Waver. The price is just what I wanted to spend and I like the fact that I can have more hairstyles than just straightened hair! I recommend purchasing this styling iron if you want to add some variety to your hairstyle and aren't comfortable using a regular curling iron to get spiral curls.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712CKS-OMvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712CKS-OMvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712CKS-OMvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eeQholzJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eeQholzJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eeQholzJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x3iRh91tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x3iRh91tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x3iRh91tL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813OwRZVm+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813OwRZVm+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813OwRZVm+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0092MCQZ4,B01M1OFZOG,AH4YBVO724V3BJUUFP4DBFQGNEHQ,1469053357000,92,True

5.0,Dry Brushing for Leaky Gut Detox,"I read, on a leaky gut blog, about dry brushing while doing detoxes so I ordered this brush to give it a try.  This thing is pretty cool to be honest and I am so glad I opted for the brush that can be modified as such.  I hate having “stuff” so anytime I can consolidate a product to be multi-use, especially living in a small space, it really helps.  So using the brush does not feel entirely unpleasant but I am sure it will be something to get used to.  It came wrapped in cellophane and really pretty tulle that it actually looked like a gift (a note for anyone ordering as a gift there is really no need to pay the extra fee for gift wrapping services).  Also there is a velour draw string bag that fits the brush when it is assembled.  The purple is gorgeous kind of reminds me of a Crown bag.  I tested the brush out on one arm at work (I have packages delivered to me at work) and my coworker said my arm feels softer than the other.  Oh and the TMI factor-I am calling it fairy dust for now but the white dust that flew off my arm, presumably dead skin, is kind of gross to see.  Makes me want to go home and brush every bit!  And so I will! I rarely give all 5 stars but I already love this thing<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  This is a required disclaimer per Amazon’s review guidelines.

5.0,"Eco friendly, healthier for baby, and fantastic?  Win, win, win!","As the mother of two young children, I have become increasingly concern about environmental chemicals and their effects on children.  I've spent hours reading about pesticides and commonly-used chemical components in cosmetics, and have ultimately decided to do whatever I can to eliminate chemicals from my home.  After doing a lot of research on The Good Guide, I decided to try Method's product, as it received one of the best scores on the site.<br /><br />First off, I want to say that I absolutely love the pump!  I've had two babies, and wrestling with the tube of cream has always annoyed me.  The pump is far neater and easier to handle.  Now that I've tried it, I don't intend to ever go back to one of those nasty tubes.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is how this cream is the only one I've tried that actually stays where it is put.  I've used Desitin and California Baby's cream, and this is the only one that sticks to the red areas on my son's bottom.  The other two had a tendency to slide right off the really red parts and onto the skin surrounding them.  Needless to say, that was very annoying, considering the point of using the cream was to try to eliminate the read sores.  This cream has a nice, thick consistency and spreads far more easily than the other two brands I've mentioned.<br /><br />The big advantage to buying this in bulk on Amazon is that it no costs me no more than the tubes of Desitin that I used to buy.  I've already used many other Method products for the home (French lavender all-purpose cleanser, hand soap, etc.), and this product has only strengthened my love for the Method brand.  I'd definitely recommend it to all parents.",[],B002Y26V46,B002Y26V46,AEHGCBDKAVKSK5UW6PJQL6JJWG7A,1282846604000,1,True

That being said, it really did enhance my C cup breasts and give me cleavage that I never had before unless I used one of those super padded push up bras. I'd also like to mention that I have very sensitive skin and because this cream is made out of 100% all natural herbs, I had no adverse reaction or side effects at all!<br /><br />I used this cream, which basically has no scent, twice a day and within a few days, I was seeing positive results. My 45 year old breasts are no longer on the saggy side. It really perked up the girls! All it took was 5 minutes to thoroughly massage this cream onto my breasts, being careful to avoid my nipples. This cream comes with a very detailed set of instructions on how to massage it onto your breasts, which actually felt very relaxing.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a slightly reduced price in exchange for honest evaluation and review. It is my honest opinion that this cream does indeed deliver the desired results that women my age want. I would most definitely recommend it to a friend and plan on continuing to use this cream myself.

5.0,Excellent Serum for all skin types,"I am a Product Tester and was offered this Anti-Aging Serum by Sublime at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback. I can honestly say that I love this product. It's a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams. (But that's just my personal opinion) I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.<br /><br />I have been using this wonderful serum 3 times a week and the results are astounding! It's nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent. It's worked wonders on minimizing those fine lines I've started to notice. It has also helped clear up my skin by unclogging my pores. Sublime contains glycolic acid and salicylic acid which are natural fruit ingredients with exfoliating properties that encourages the sloughing of dead skin cells improving the tone and texture of my skin. My skin looks radiant and more youthful.<br /><br />It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Sublime works very well and has become part of my skin care routine.

5.0,Get a spa quality treatment in 20 minutes.,"I love to pamper myself with deep hydrating/anti-aging facial masks.

I received this particular mask at a special price for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. Everything contained in this review is my own personal experience using this mask.<br />First I made sure my face was freshly washed and found a quiet area where I could apply the mask and lay back and relax for 20 minutes. By quiet area, I mean I made sure I was home alone so no one would bother me, I turned the television off and played some soft soothing music to relax myself and to really give myself that spa experience.<br />Applying the mask was super simple and it completely fit all the contours of my face evenly. Thereby giving my face all the wonderful benefits of this rich hydrating formula. Then I just relaxed and let the mask do all the work. I have sensitive skin and was pleased that the all natural ingredients in this mask did not irritate my sensitive skin what so ever. In fact, it actually helped improve the look and feel of my skin after just one use. After the 20 minutes were up, I was amazed at how soft and hydrated my skin felt. I had no idea I had let my skin get that dry. I plan on taking time out for myself at least once a week to give myself a deep hydrating, anti-aging mask. After all, the key to younger looking skin, is keeping it well hydrated. I love these masks and would also recommend them.

It is a clear gel that goes on smoothly when applied. I made sure to rub my skin in a circular motion for 60 seconds before rinsing it off. It has a cooling sensation when on my skin and has a nice fresh scent. My skin felt very, very soft when I rinsed off this gel. It also made the skin on my hands look renewed.

I have loved all of the Sublime Beauty products that I have used. All of their products are made with high quality ingredients. That is very important to me because I have sensitive skin that will break out easily. I really have to be careful with any products that I use on my face. I have used products with glycolic acid before with great results. I have also used salicylic acid, but it was always in my acne products. I have never used a serum containing both. This serum is truly amazing and I just can't get over how well it works on my face. My acne totally dried up and my pores looked so small and clear, especially all of the pores around my nose. I have very oily skin, so I started using it everyday. I noticed though, that my skin really started to get dry when using it everyday, so I started using it every other day. I still get the same great results, but now I don't have any dryness on my face. This serum is pretty thin and goes on easily. I didn't need to use much to cover my entire face.

I have very sensitive skin and break out easily, so I have be careful what products I use. I had no breakouts or irritation with this serum. I really like the consistency of this serum. It's not too thick or too thin and it's nice that it has a pump instead of an eye dropper. I find that easier to use. One pump was more than enough to cover my entire face. I love how hydrated and youthful my face looks after using this for 2 weeks. It also makes my face feel so smooth. I did not put a moisturizer on after the serum, because I wanted to see how my skin reacted to the serum alone.

4.0,Powerful Age Fighting Eye Gel...,"I've been using this eye gel for over three weeks now. I've tried and tested several eye gels in the past. I'd rate this one some where in the middle of the pack. I'm glad to see that the price has come down from the $40 price tag it was when I was initially sent a bottle at a discounted price simply to provide my experience and opinion about this product. It does have some wonderful ingredients and I appreciate the generous size bottle and the fact that the print isn't too small to read both on the box and the bottle. Thank you for that. I also like that it's paraben free, not tested on animals, contains no dyes or fragrances and is made in America. I don't like that it contains Alcohol. It is on the bottom of the ingredient list but I'm thinking that it's needed to combat the stickiness. It does a great job at waking up tired eyes. Within minutes, fine lines fill in as this product seems to plump up your skin. Where I find it to be a problem is that I have to follow it up with another eye cream to lose the stickiness before applying makeup. On days when I don't wear makeup, it's not a problem. Probably because it has more time to penetrate the skin. Overall, it's a nice product that is now priced right.",[],B016FLEZH6,B016FLEZH6,AFW5YHQFWEQK7PF7PD7ZSBITHHKQ,1449419612000,0,False
4.0,Great for your legs!,"They say the cure for cancer will be found in the sea. I've long been a fan of Dead Sea Mineral products so I was excited when LeliaSea sent me a sample to try and test as a consumer for the purpose of this review. Here's my opinion:<br /><br />It's packaged quite nicely. I don't detect much of a scent at all which is nice so it won't compete with my fragrances. However, I think it's quite small for a body lotion. It's the size of a hand cream. So given it's size, I feel like it's a bit pricey but it is a nice lotion. It soaks in quickly to dry skin and is highly moisturizing. It works well on my legs but on my hands it feels a little greasy. It's best to use on the driest parts of your body.

The cap snaps on and off firmly like it should. There's a pretty rose design on it as well. The serum has a pleasant scent, it's clear and just the right consistency. Some others are runnier than I like. Best of all, this serum is non drying yet firming. I put it all over my face and neck twice a day and followup with a quality moisturizer. I've been using a variety of Vitamin C Serums as a avid product tester for the past 6 months with excellent results. This one ranks in my top five and not as pricey as others I've tried.

I have combination skin and it caters to whatever your skin needs. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks and my age spots are faded, my lines are minimized and it doesn't my forehead oily like others do.

5.0,HOT PINK!!!!!,I actually purchased the Aneomne Wind Flower Hair Dryer by XTAVA but was sent the Peony by mistake. However when I opened the package I just fell in love with the bright pink dryer!  Pink is after all my favorite color!  The Peony is compact and will fit in a suitcase with ease for traveling. I love the multiple speeds and the different heat settings. I have fairly short hair and this dried my hair in a matter of minutes on medium speed. It would have taken less time if I didn't have to use brushes to style with.  It does come with two concentrator nozzles one for long hair and one for short.  I love these because I use a round brush and this allows me to direct heat to the area I'm working on and the rest of my hair isn't blowing around all over the place. It is a bit loud but that doesn't bother me and I don't find any any heavier than other dryers I've had that are made by XTAVA. All in all I love the dryer and expect to have years of use from it as long as my nieces don't steal it just because of the girly color. I was offered the Aneomme Wind Flower Dryer at a substantial discount for testing and providing feedback. Please know that Amazon offered me a mailing label to return the dryer so I wouldn't be out any money for returning.

5.0,Fragrance and Performance Both Surprising,"I admit I’m a shaving hobbyist. Soaps are like Pokémon, gotta catch ‘me all.<br /><br />But we hobby shavers end up using these soaps once or twice and if they aren’t in our top 20 we put them up on the Reddit shaver trading boards. This way we can try ten soaps for the price of two, keep the ones we like and trade the rest looking for more winners.<br /><br />Ladies and germs, this is a winner. My first Ogallalla product, I tried it on the recommendation of a guy I frequently trade with whose tastes are similar in many ways and who likes and demands the same performance characteristics of his shaving soaps. When he recommends one I sit up and listen.<br /><br />So let’s talk performance. This soap, with my 26mm synthetic shaving brush, makes a ton of lather. A surprising amount. I kept adding water to get it down from “cake batter” to “pancake batter” to the soft whipped peaks and glossy sheen that lets me know it’s hydrated enough for maximum slickness. A nice thirsty shaving stick. Hooray. The ingredient list is vegan. I generally prefer soaps with tallow bases and added lanolin but I’m open minded about it. There are some vegan soaps in my keeper drawer.<br /><br />Slickness was very good. Not quite what you can get from B&M’s “Reserve” line or good old Mitchell’s Wool Fat but very close. Lather, once worked to a good sheen and soft peaks, did not dissipate on the brush or dry on my skin. Maintains hydration well. Once again, B&M does it better, but for over $4 an ounce it ought to. For $1.50/oz. this stuff performs very well indeed. And as a bonus they include the plastic stick dispenser you won’t get from Arko or Speick. I just found my go-to travel shaving soap.<br /><br />Scent: clovey but not as clovey as Ogallala’s matching aftershave, particularly the double strength. I found following my shave with Ogallala Bay Rum + Sweet Orange aftershave, regular strength, left my face smooth, disinfected, hydrated, and smelling like a Christmas tree but in a good way. The traditional clove top note fades on the dry down, leaving you with a really good scent for the rest of the day.<br /><br />Some guys hate cloves. They get their bay rum fix from B&M, which uses no clove in its bay rum products. I like that too.<br /><br />But this is a fantastic shaving experience for a shockingly low price, with added travel benefits. I’ll especially use it as the weather cools. I’m not keeping it because it performs well relative to price. I’m keeping it because it performs well regardless of price. The low price and portability are bonuses.<br /><br />If you are a spice aficionado like me I recommend you try this shaving stick and don’t skimp on the water.",[],B0042R25KU,B0042R25KU,AENKIQKMMLDWZ5G26DESZDAC7BOQ,1528822566585,1,False
5.0,One Of My Favorite Shave Soaps.,"Of the traditional great shaving soaps, MWF is the postshave king. Barrister & Mann, L&L, Wholly Kaw, A&E, Italian Extro, there are wonderful soaps out there. They all have great scents and most can match MWF in slickness, cushion and glide. And they’re really close on the post shave. But good old MWF still rules the post shave roost. I love Mitchell’s Wool Fat. I have a Simpson’s Emperor badger brush that was very expensive. Tried and tried to get it to work with MWF, couldn’t get a lather no matter what I tried. I liked the stuff anyway. Then I got a $20 synthetic Plisson knockoff brush. It is the missing link. Loads in 30 seconds, face lathers wonderfully.<br /><br />If you are having trouble lathering MWF do what I did and get a fat synthetic brush. It transforms the Mitchell’s experience.<br /><br />Combined with my favorite razor, the Rockwell 6s set to “3” with a Feather blade, a good aftershave lotion and cologne, I’ve got an awesome shave here.<br /><br />Provides plenty of slickness and cushion like any traditional tallow soap. But the addition of unsaponified lanolin (which also makes it hard to lather) gives this stuff its unparalleled post-shave feel. You will love your soft face after shaving with Mitchell’s and so will your wife, girlfriend or both.<br /><br />Clean off with a hot damp washcloth, then pat dry and hit with a generous amount of Speick aftershave splash. Your pores will immediately tighten up, whiskers will retract, and you will have a perfectly smooth face.<br /><br />If you are going to use Feathers, the samurai sword of DE blades, you need a slick soap like Mitchell’s to keep from cutting yourself. Mitchell’s does its job well.<br /><br />Get some. It might be your favorite too. I will always keep it in my rotation.",[],B06XRZ6Q4Z,B06XRZ6Q4Z,AENKIQKMMLDWZ5G26DESZDAC7BOQ,1508208707523,0,False

3.0,Fine for Special Occasions,"Overall, this works okay. I cannot do winged eyeliner for the life of me, so this pen was very appealing. I liked that it had eyeliner on the other end, so the two colors/sheens of the eyeliner and stamp are uniform. I did have to try the stamp a few times, as my eyes are big and every now and then, the stamp did not get my whole eye (so there were spaces it did not get to). I'd recommend stamping it with your eye closed. You also have to practice so both sides are at the right angle. I thought the end of the eyeliner brush was pretty thick (making the line more dramatic than usual) but it easily glided on and was very easy to apply. The stamp also was fairly light at times, so I had to go over it again (but it was helpful to have an outline). It looks nice overall and will be good to use during fancier events where I want my eyeliner to be more dramatic. Still helpful overall and makes the winged look more attainable, just not ideal for my everyday look.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H2u0yPZ6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H2u0yPZ6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H2u0yPZ6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B077KQRS49,B077KQRS49,AHD5ORSHM3N5VCG4ICHZH3DEA3QQ,1518228621666,6,True

5.0,Wow. This is really nice stuff.,"Two things drew me to ordering this product. The rose scent and the name ""Manilla."" I assumed it was made in the Philippines, and I'm half Filipino. To my surprise, it's made in Lithuania! It is, however, really quite nice. It's a moisturizer with a scent - not something too often seen these days - but the primary aroma is definitely rose. And I just can't resist that. The scent doesn't linger and follow you around. I really only noticed it until after the cream had been absorbed. The cream itself is very sheer and feels lovely going on. It's absorbed quickly and leaves no greasy residue behind. My skin is quite sensitive and I've experienced no breakout issues. All in all, using this product has been a genuine pleasure, both tactile and sensory. I really just enjoy using it, and my skin feels soft and moist, even in our dry winter air.

5.0,My new favorite thing! I'm obsessed with it.,"This is really wonderful stuff. The application directions are unusual. Following them, I put four drops (that's what works for me) in my palm, then rub my palms together until they feel warm. Then I pat my face with them, applying the serum all over. I spread it gently afterwards to make sure I haven't missed any areas. The solution is very quickly absorbed and leaves my skin feeling as soft as a baby's bottom, as the old expression says. I'm mean it's reeeealy soft, and not oily or greasy at all. It's AMAZING. What really has me addicted is the smell. It's not floral or citrus, or really like anything I can put my finger on. If I had to, I'd say it's faintly sweet… possibly herbal? Well, whatever it is, it's intoxicating to me. It lingers just a while after the serum dries and I thoroughly enjoy it. I'd wear this scent as a perfume if it were available. It's not strong or offensive; it's just unique and pleasant. I recommend this with enthusiasm!!",[],B07NPCT6L5,B07NPCT6L5,AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,1607704149561,0,False
5.0,Better than the loofa one I have.,"I recently started using one of these with loofa on it. It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it. It's great, and I'm really glad I gave this a try!",[],B08FD2KP9R,B08FD2KP9R,AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,1599144493171,2,False

This is just too oversized for me. It's difficult to hold and control. It's also overstuffed with a very convex surface, so only the center of the raised area actually touches my body. It doesn't mold itself to the surface of my skin, so I feel like I'm scrubbing in thin lines, and it doesn't really do the job in the dips and grooves a human body has because of that. It does dries quickly, even though I don't have anything to hang it off of. I'm pretty disappointed with this order and I can't recommend this product.",[],B08B5FJMHM,B08B5FJMHM,AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,1598622810104,1,False
5.0,Quite happy with this! A great find.,"I had some reservations... I’ve seen the round wood ones around, but never made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too heavy and bulky, but it does not. It’s quite lightweight and because it’s vertical, saves some space. It comes with extensive directions - a nice change - but is really very easy to use and set up. It’s very hot and humid where I live, so I was also worried that adding more humidity to the air would be a bad thing, however, the air that comes out is quite cool, which seems to cool down the area around it (and by “it”, I mean me). I found it very comfortable.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I love it! You can choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can choose to have your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It’s quite restful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It doesn’t hold a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be inconvenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT’S easy to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn’t be happier with this unit! It checks all the boxes and I can enjoy my essential oils in an peaceful, comforting environment.

4.0,Great results from this wax!,"I had a leg and bikini wax with this product and liked it a great deal.  In the past, I've used soy wax (Nufree) in salons and this is also a great product because it doesn't bond to the skin making it much less painful and more to the point doesn't cause near the amount of skin irritation.  The Plum Smooth wax does the same thing but with the added bonus of having a more pleasant smell.  I also found that I had even less post-wax irritation with this than with any other wax I've used.  For my at-home waxing I've used consumer available wax strips like Veet, etc.  but these universally are low quality and, in addition to being more painful (even to an experienced waxer like me), cause irritation and sometimes even bruising/broken skin in the more sensitive areas where the skin it thinner.  This product is better than anything else I've tried and here's hoping that the results continue to be as good as the first couple times of use.  As a side note - the other reviewer had negative results and correctly stated that what works for some people may not work with others - in my experience people that have not had good results with soy wax or the Plum Smooth due to irritation it has been because of allergies or incorrect use of the product, but these are generally considered to be much gentler on the skin than any sugar waxes or products you can purchase as a consumer.",[],B00KM5K4DG,B00KM5K4DG,AFM4MZPOUOGMP6ZSDH2ZJD6SJG5Q,1441606307000,0,False

5.0,"Works great, lots of features and really holds a charge!","I've used electric razors for years and yet I've never considered Wahl as an option. I have to say I've been pleasantly surprised.  I've been using a much more expensive rotary shaver and this one beats it on so many fronts.  This one shaves as close as the more expensive model and has a built-in trimmer. That seems like it should be standard feature and yet my other razor requires me to pop on a different head.  This shaver lasts much longer on a charge and, if the spec is to be believed, can last 90 minutes on continuous use. That's incredible and means you'll likely never need to charge it away from home.  One less charger to carry and one fewer thing to worry about while packing are good things!  And if it does run out on you, there's a quick charge feature that let's you get one shave in with only a min. or two charge. Impressive. Lastly, like many electrics, it's a wet/dry shaver so for those needing that feature it's as versatile as competitive brands.  I doubt that any electric razor really will shave as close as a (good) blade and no product is every going to please everyone but I'm impressed that I don't see any reviews below three stars.

The problem with me is that I have been using the Oral B Cross Action battery operated brush for years and in comparing this new brush to the battery operated, I believe the battery operated Cross Action brush did a better job. My mouth felt cleaner after using the battery operated brush.  Perhaps if I buy the Cross action brush heads for the Vitality Precision, I will be more positive.

I watched every video I could find on how to use these clips and they all used the following steps:  (1) Start with clean dry hair.  Move the top layer of hair out of the way and take a section of hair from underneath.  Put the clips in with some looseness against the scalp.  They should not be tight against your scalp.  Make sure the clip part is turned to the outside and the hair is pulled straight away from scalp.  (2) apply heat gently to hair using medium to high heat and low air flow (3) apply cold air using hair dryer or wait for hair to cool naturally.  Do not leave the clip in too long if you are letting it cool naturally or it may leave kinks.  (3) Take out the clips and comb through with fingers, ruffling slightly to break up any visible kinks.  Blend in top layer so any kinks still visible will be hidden underneath.  Good luck!",[],B08GF8L6BK,B08GF8L6BK,AFGJVCNJFXFJI34NNAUMUWQ5IOVA,1614414309523,2,True

5.0,Easy for novices,"I never had luscious lashes. They are also very short. I had to use a lot of mascara in order for them to even be seen. As I matured, those problems became more pronounced. So one day I decided that I was going to be brave and try false lashes. That day came in my 64th year. I struggled with putting them on so much! I put on too much glue or not enough glue or it wasn't tacky enough or I put them on incorrectly-so many ways to fail, and I seemed skilled at every one of those failures. The few times that I did venture out wearing them I felt like Carol Burnett in her comedy show portraying Marlena Dietrich. Then I stumbled upon these . Not only do these go on easily but they've taught me how to put on eyelashes. So now I can use glue and position other types of lashes and so forth due to the practice I was allowed with these pre-glued ones.

5.0,Definitely recommend for the beard in your life!,"My husband and I are so in love with his Wild Willie’s Beard Elixir, so we were incredibly excited for his Wild Willie’s Beard Wash and Beard Rinse.  My husband was reluctant at first to add another step to his morning routine, until he tried the product.  First off, the wash and rinse smell so much better than the generic men’s 3 in 1 he had been using from Target.  Oftentimes men’s products have a tendency to smell overpoweringly chemically, but these just smell fresh and clean, while still imparting a masculine scent in general.  The essential oils used are peppermint, eucalyptus, and lemongrass, and do not smell like a cheap cologne, which is usually typical for a mens wash.  I, as the wife, have noticed a change in the positive in my husband’s beard since using the Wild Willie’s products.  I have always loved his beard, but it smells better and is more manageable with the introduction of these products into his regular wash routine.  Before it was super rough and unruly, and now it feels softer and lays flatter.  I love that the Beard Wash and Beard Rinse are sulfate free, as this is a priority in our household.  They are also 75% and 80% certified organic, which is important to me, and I feel they are affordable as far as organic toiletries go.

Most lash serums suggest putting on before bed at night.  I can never remember when I go to bed, so I put mine on in the morning when I'm applying my makeup.  For me, this works fine.  I just let it dry for a minute and put my eye liner over it.  I have done that routine with this product and it has done fine.  As with the other ones I've tried, I will also be using it in my eye brows.  In three days I have not noticed a huge difference in the length (I have long lashes anyway), but I have also not noticed any irritation or loss of lashes like I've seen in some.

2.0,Great variety but they dont stay in for long.,"Updated review: I've changed my rating from a 4 to a 2 and the only reason it's not a 1 is because I love the variety. These peices dont stay in their hair. Not 1 piece has made it threw naptime or even a 10 minute car ride. I constantly have to redo or tighten them because they just slip out, no matter how tight. My daughter is 2 with hair passed her shoulders so Its not like im grasping at fuzz either. Definitely not worth the price.<br /><br />Ive been so excited for these and am not disappointed at all. I do have to say that I think the price is a bit steep for hair ties but i have yet to experience a break which is a huge plus.  I hate getting my 2 year olds hair just right and when i go to tie it up, the dang tie snaps. Iv used about 6 different ones so far and they've all kept their hold and didnt stretch out either.

5.0,Only deodorant that works for me.,"Love this. This is the only deodorant I've found in all my life (I'm only 27 though) that works. Before this, deodorants did not work for me. My natural scent and the fake fragrance makes me smell horrible and would accentuate any BO I might have. My best bet was to go deodorant-less and just wash my armpits when they got stinky. Then I started using natural salt products. Those irritated my skin due to the dryness (so I basically had itchy armpits). Then I came across a coupon for Soft & Dri, it would come out to $2 so I figured what the heck, I'll try something new. Well it works. I'm still surprised it works. It's been three months and I think I still have half a can left.<br />I only spray it very shortly. I don't spray it enough to leave any white residue. Do be careful when putting on clothes right after spraying it. Also, the scent is kind of strong - a powdery smell. It's not the kind of scent I'd prefer, but at this point, I don't mind smelling a little grandma-y when no deodorant has ever worked for me.",[],B00E4MOFJ2,B00E4MOFJ2,AFQUXYCRXFGFQPQCIYXGNHKVOFBQ,1406127002000,0,False

5.0,Cute scrunchi!,I’m a long time scrunchi gal and I always have one in my hair or around my wrist. The invisibobbi scrunchi isn’t your ordinary elastic band covered in fabric; it is one of those swirly-do/keyring spirally things inside of the fabric. Is there much difference? In my opinion no not really but I like the fabrics these come in as they’re all super cute. I personally LOVE the black velvet as it matches most everything. I like using these over standard rubber bands as they don’t kink my hair like a rubber band would. I have thick and long hair (hangs to the middle of my bra)  and these hold my hair up in a top knot or ponytail pretty well. I have tested using it while doing Pilates and I had to adjust it a couple of times but for normal activity it holds up great. Finally it does stretch out to accommodate thick hair and wrap a couple times around but it returns to<br />its original shape and doesn’t stay stretched out (I’ve had that issue with elastic band scrunchi where they get stretched out and unusable).

4.0,The power of peppermint! (And other natural stuff thats cool i guess),"I've had a beard for 3 years.  It's pretty thick and heavy and tends to grow in thickness/volume and not length.  It's more like a face afro, if you will.  Overall it's a pretty healthy beard but I decided to give Wild Willie's a shot since I like their beard butter so much.<br /><br />First off I when the bottle arrived i really thought they werr small.  So for $30 i wasnt sure if it was money well spent.  Time will tell.<br />Second I love the peppermint smell.  I don't feel it's overpowering at all and find it refreshing in the morning.  The shampoo lathers really well and a dime size goes a long way, even in my thick beard.  We do have soft water FYI, so that usually helps any soap/shampoo lathers better.  It feels like it cleans really well with out drying my beard out.<br /><br />The conditioner goes a long way as well. About a dime to penny size drop is all I need depending on how thick my beard has gotten.  I let the conditioner sit for about 5 minutes to let it really work in.  It leaves a nice cool tingling feeling on my face and has the great peppermint smell.  When I rinse it, it doesn't leave a heavy conditioner feel and rinses cleanly.<br /><br />Overall I think it does a good job.  It leaves my beard moisturized and not dried out and somewhat soft.  Definitely keeps my beard looking healthy and shiny.  In fact, while I actually get a lot of compliments on having a really great beard; once I started using these products I got so many more compliments. Now, that may just be a coincidence.<br /><br />Overall I'm so far satisfied.  Both shampoo and conditioner have lasted about a month with less than half used.

5.0,"Works really well, although don't delude yourself that it won't hurt.","I'm a tweezing/waxing maniac. Although it does hurt to wax, it doesn't suck as much as having to shave all the time, so I prefer it over shaving. The downside to that is that it is so expensive. In my town, an underarm wax can cost $22 plus tip, and since the hair will grow back at different times you may end up wishing for another wax just a week later. You also have to wait until it's long enough too. Since I was tired of the cost of waxing and I don't mind the pain of waxing or plucking, I thought an epilator would be a good buy. I did a lot of research on each type and finally settled on this one about 6 months ago based on the positive reviews. I made the right choice, for sure, and it has paid for itself at least 5 times over by now.<br />Pros:<br />*It is actually better not to let the hair grow long, so that means you don't have to be hairy for long periods of time<br />*You can do it at any given time, if there is anything to pull, which is way better than a once-per month trip to the waxer's shop.<br />*It doesn't hurt as bad once you are consistent with it, just like with waxing.<br />*It is fairly easy to clean and easy to recharge<br />*The flashlight is a great tool to help see those hairs you would miss just off the ceiling lights.<br />*You can use it almost anywhere, or anywhere you have help from another pair of unwary hands. Bikini line, chin, upper lip, underarm, leg, arm, you name it. My underarms and bikini line are my favorite places to use it.<br />*You can use it in the shower<br />*The battery lasts pretty long, like an hour<br />Cons:<br />*If you try to give yourself a brazilian wax with it by yourself, you are gonna have a bad time. I tried and failed. Luckily, the top part came off before it could do any damage, so it was really just a bit scary. It jammed when that happened, and wouldn't turn back on, but I just plugged it in for a charge and it was back to normal.<br />*It hurts pretty bad. As opposed to waxing, which takes it all off in one go, it pulls hairs one at a time like tweezing, but at a fast pace. That means there is a lot of breath holding and holding of skin to keep it all tight because you don't know when or how many hairs it will find and pull out. I suggest taking 600mg of Ibuprofen a half hour before you intend to do it... or maybe a few glasses of wine if you'd rather not use traditional drugs.<br />*The hair will fly EVERYWHERE, but where else would it go, I guess?",[],B00AX3YNPC,B00AX3YNPC,AFDPEVHIDXDRQB2GWK44IR3ZCVPA,1388386083000,10,True

5.0,Very easy way to add volume and bold color,"Very Juicy and very easy to create thick beautiful brows.  I eyebrows with a nice shape but they are very thin from years of plucking, and very light from sun exposure and my natural coloring.  So I am always paying to have them dyed and even that only helps darken them a little, it does not bring up the fullness.  This product adds both color and fullness, it goes on with only one or two bold juicy strokes. These must be properly placed, it takes a couple tries to get the right angle. I found that the first stroke should be the very outside third of my brow, where I need the most volume. Next I do one more half brush on the middle of my brow and it is done.  Once it dries, I have thick, dark and dramatic brows.<br />This product create volume once it dries, so if you get it on properly, you end up with more eyebrow. It can be tricky and the first couple applications were messy for me, because I had never worked with such a juicy product.  The dry time is slow, not the kind of thing you can do just before you run out the door.<br />Using this brow gel eliminates the need for me to get my brows dyed at the salon, so I am very happy with it.  It is very solid and does not smudge or run.  It washes off with cleanser and I recommend it for anyone who wants more volume.",[],B072JX98Y6,B072JX98Y6,AH2ATN3JHDNX6VQBCS3UXCC55IRQ,1511290240383,0,True

5.0,First (almost) electric razor,"Just had my first shave with this. I've used two electric razors in my life. One was an already ancient one that my dad had, about 40 years ago. Ripped each of the few hairs in my face out one by one. Then an early Norelco 3-head circular job, about 30 years ago that either sucked or I didn't know how to use. Very even stubble was the result of that. Hence my refusal to try one until my memories have faded.<br /><br />This review reflects one shave - not a long term review.<br /><br />I'm impressed. It's slower than I expected, I half-thought I could activate an app on my phone or something and I would be shaved (I'm joking!). It's pretty darn close to a manual 5-blade fresh razor.<br /><br />Here are the conditions under which I'm reporting:<br />- I'm 62, so my skin isn't exactly taut on my face.<br />- Not a heavy beard, I need to shave every day now, but not until I was about 35.<br />- This shave was with 2 days of stubble.<br />- I usually shave in the shower, using Braille to tell when a patch is smooth.<br /><br />I used the razor dry. The manual said to charge the razor before first use, but it came out of the box showing 100% charge so I went for it. The manual also says not to apply too much pressure, so I was tentative at first. It helps to apply fair pressure while moving the razor SLOWLY through that fungus that seems to grow constantly on our faces.<br /><br />Stretching my skin with other-handed fingers in most spots helped. I used a mirror just to watch the progress, but you can use your sonic sensors, AKA ears, to tell when the blades are and aren't removing stubble. I don't think a mirror is at all necessary, YMMV.<br /><br />While I've been writing this, I've used Braille again to check on the usual trouble spots - I can just grab the mower and run it over the rough bits while I'm doing this. You could do this easily while driving somewhere - no risk of a small knick, and the aural attention that it takes doesn't really distract from driving.<br /><br />I didn't notice when I ordered this razor that it came with an extra foil. Nice detail, since the foil is easy to damage being thin (as it should be). The kit comes with a carrying bag, which is nice to keep everything together while traveling. I would find a small rigid container for the extra foil if I were to travel with that - it could easily get bent in the carrying bag knocking around with all the bits. The foil is too long for the old canisters from film cameras, but a cut-off from a roll of Xmas paper would suffice.<br /><br />The grip is comfortable and makes the shaving head easy to maneuver. The carrying bag contains everything in a small package - I'm a Cardinal (Archbishops and above don't shave) in the Church of Small Luggage and I will happily carry this instead of a couple of manual razors on any trip.<br /><br />Finally (applause erupts from the crowd),  very nearly close shave as a manual razor, a little slower than a manual razor, works very well dry (absolutely unlike a manual razor, though I've tried that also and it does sort of work).<br /><br />Buy it. Try it.",[],B07KRJB3FF,B07KRJB3FF,AFXVCEEIAVRQV4HHOUFBKDPD747Q,1547505486496,23,True

3.0,Did not shave close for me,"This unit is well designed, quiet; feels good in the hand and super-easy to clean. The shave was comfortable and did not irritate my face. The price is quite reasonable. Unfortunately it didn't shave close enough for me. If I made many passes I could get a close shave but would find that by 4pm I would need to shave again(not that my beard is so heavy). Like all electrics I've used it does a sub-par job under the chin and on the neck. I've decided to send it back and go back to my Braun. Right now I've used the Norelco and then finished with the Braun, which even with year-old blades is much closer and just as fast.<br /><br />This is electric shaver number five for me (4 bought thru Amazon). I started ~15 years ago with a norelco 5xxx series, and was satified for a few years. Despite changing the blades (perhaps my beard got tougher)I became dissatisfied with the shave. I switched to a Braun 5000 series which was noticably closer with the exception of the neck which required many passes to shave adequately.<br /><br />The Braun lost it's edge after about a year or two, and I decided to try one of the Panasonic ultra-high speed, wet-dry units (10,000)strokes/min. I got a good deal on a close-out  unit. I liked the build and the wet-dry feature, and the ease of cleaning, but I found that this shaver irritated my skin. I went back to the braun, and later upgraded to a Braun 7526, which I bought refurbished without the cleaning unit. It does a superior job and next time I upgrade I may buy the unit with the cleaner. It needs new blades yearly for best results, and it too doesn't do a great job with on my neck; but everything else is excellent.",[],B000068PBN,B000068PBN,AEZA3IMRXF2SGW3Y7E4ZNT4TQBPQ,1097890943000,14,True

After it dries use some tweezers to remove the glue from the very tip of the stillet.

5.0,Pefect well made little bows!,"I bought these bows to sew on soft cat collars that I purchase for my chihuahua.  They are very well made.  There was not a defective bow in the package.  They were all perfect well made bows.  The bows came in a plastic reusable zip storage bag.  I cut the rubber band portion off or either peel back the center part of the bow to remove the rubber band so that I can then stitch the bow onto the cat collars.  My dog has about 20 different cat collars with bows & flowers that I have sewn onto the collars.  Some of the Blueberry brand cat collars came with bows already on them.  I put cat collars on her because she stalks creatures in the yard like a cat.  The bell will alert birds & also the breakaway collar will prevent her from getting chocked if she becomes tangled in vegetation.  She is a very sweet dog in the house, but she becomes a bloodthirsty killer in the yard.  She must have some terrier in her bloodline.  She creeps across the yard on her belly like a cat stalking prey.  My Jack Russell Terrier killed anything that moved.  I hardly have any lizards or green frogs (they make her ill for 24hrs after she bites them, but she can't resist mauling them again & again) left in my yard.  I try to rescue the creatures, but she is very fast in order to catch a frog or a lizard.  She now has taken to stalking the house geckos (invasive species in the southeast) at night that live in my garage, but they stay up high on the walls where she can't reach them.  Anyway, the bows are perfect & work very well for sewing onto pet collars.  I am sure that they would work just as well in a small child's hair. They are small.  Just under 2 inches in length.  There is pretty much every basic color, but white.",[],B07C46B793,B07C46B793,AFMHNVOICR3B6HLRGV3D3LN3L3MA,1527720945836,0,True

You also get a small brush for cleaning the trimmer and a charging cable which strangely is a USB to Mini-USB even though at the bottom of the trimmer is your standard two prong charging connector.<br /><br />Being able to charge this via USB however is great for when you need to go on holiday/vacation as you always have some kind of USB charging device with yourself (usually for your phone).  On a full charge the clippers will roughly 2 hours and are small enough to just throw in your toiletry bag.<br /><br />The trimmer itself has a nice shape to it and is comfortable to hold in your hand.  It also has a fairly nice heft to it, not too light but not heavy.  It feels like you are really holding on to something though.<br /><br />The head is fairly wide which can be a plus in that it doesn't take long at all to trim an area but can also be a bit of a minus depending on the shape of your face if you are trimming your beard.  The action is smooth and has a nice gliding feel to it, even if you don't use any attachments and just use the trimmer head itself.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the Maybuy came with some sort of carrying case to put it, the attachments and the charging cord in but it doesn't unfortunately.

5.0,AWESOME PRODUCT! EASY TO USE! NO BURNS!,"I just received this KINDOMCARES hair straightening comb today and I was so excited I could not wait to try it. The comb itself is of high quality and comes packaged very nicely. It has an on/off button and six heat settings depending on the weight, curl and thickness of your hair. My hair is color treated, slightly wavy with medium thickness so I used the middle setting (3 to 4). The device heated up in under a minute and is cool to the touch as the heating element is not exposed to the outer edge of the comb. I found that starting from the underside of my hair gave me more control than just combing it down my head. I was able to straighten my whole head in under 5 minutes. I love that I cannot burn myself which is my main complaint about hair straightening irons. Also, I was able to get my hair straight without hearing it sizzle as I did not need as much heat. I am posting picture of the device, my blown dry hair before and my straight hair afterwards. I really like this comb better than the many other methods I have tried. I did receive the KINDOMCARES ceramic heating comb at a discount or at no charge for the purpose of providing the company with my honest and unbiased feedback. I would highly recommend it to you!!!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LNY0tAnSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LNY0tAnSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LNY0tAnSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0+cIIQ3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0+cIIQ3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0+cIIQ3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XJ1HJPy0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XJ1HJPy0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XJ1HJPy0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01G1F7HAS,B01G1F7HAS,AFRTKIPKZVBK4LQ6VTD7NE5UQUEQ,1465588533000,1,False

I have been trying to take better care of my skin to age gracefully so I jumped at the chance to try this mask heater. Immediately, I loved how upscale the packaging was as was the unit itself. It also comes with a two year manufacturers warranty, which is amazing.  Certainly, it would make a very thoughtful and elegant gift. The unit heats up any saturated paper mask. You can purchase them on Amazon or very inexpensively buy the unsaturated masks and whip up your own ingredients. I loved how quickly the mask heats up, yet the unit does not get dangerously hot. Not only does a warm mask open your pores and absorb better but it feels amazing! It really made me feel pampered and relaxed, which most of us don't do often enough. I would highly recommend this mask heater. I want to thank the manufacturer, Kindom Cares, for providing me this electric mask heater at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

5.0,Perfect wig for Lucy cosplay,"I’m so used to ordering wigs from Arda; I was anxious getting one from Amazon. But, my fellow cosplaying peoples- this wig is amazing.<br /><br />My takeaways:<br />-the blonde color is a pretty and more natural blend of yellows. It’s a beautiful color, not crazily oversaturated like some blonde cosplay wigs turn out. It has a very natural vibe.<br />-My picture comes from AFTERa cut and styled it. I should have taken a photo from the get-go but the wig is actually pretty long. The hair fell nearly tiny abdomen and so I had to take about 5-7 inches off. With this wig, I decided to cut it whilst wearing it (rather than put it on a wig head stand) and I used my sharpest pair of scissors to shear it up to where I wanted it. This technique worked PERFECTLY. Since there is already wave in the wig, shearing helped keep the movement and avoided that choppy look you can sometimes get when you lop off length.<br />-ponytail piece is hair attached to a clip. It is incredibly easy to attach to the wig and isn’t incredibly heavy either. I had to take off quite a bit of length on the ponytail piece because it nearly touched my shoulder. I decided not to take it too too short simply because I wanted to ensure the clip kept good coverage and I wanted to make sure there was enough hair to hide the purple bow piece that I made.<br />-the bangs are a perfect length; no crazy eye pokeage and they held really easy after a spritz of hair spray<br />-the wig itself seems sometimes like, “oh no it’s statidlc and maybe tangling” but you can literally just run your fingers through it and it returns to form.<br /><br />This was a great purchase. Really really good quality for the price; highly recommended.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619U2DJ-lvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619U2DJ-lvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619U2DJ-lvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00CYKAIQK,B00CYKAIQK,AGK3J22UQO5HY7SIWKFZBYCQMV6Q,1559786715130,2,True

4.0,Purchased this item in Marshall's for $6.99,"So as I have stated in previous skin care  product reviews, I am EXTREMELY vain. That is probably due to the fact that I suffer with Adult Acne. Never had acne until I reached my mid 20's. So as a fair skin woman in her mid 30's my focus is to lessen the severity of my outbreaks, and to keep my skin looking youthful and CLEAR! Like other women in my predicament I have spend loads of money on what seems like millions of products sometimes they work, then after a couple of months they cease to have any effect. So besides incorporating multivitamins into my life (B complex, Flaxseed oil, MSM, DMAE, etc) which I take pretty consistently, I drink plenty of water or as much as I can take, eat fairly healthy (no soda, no juice, no candy, no chips, little to no fast food) and of course I exercise. All these things will play into how healthy your skin will and can be! So on a recent trip to South Carolina, I ran into a Marshall's and I always check out the skincare section. Now within the last couple of months my skin will begin to clear up completely then BAM I will get a medium red nodule, or inflamed whitehead.... UGH! And though you are not suppose too I always pop mine to relieve the pain and pressure. I always do it with clean hands, and typical wash my face with my 10% sulfur soap I purchased here on Amazon. So when I ran into this Brightening product for $6.99 it caught my eye. With all the sulfur and scrubs and acne drying products my skin was looking pretty dull and kinda flaky. I needed something to help diminish my acne scars, moisturize and smooth out my skin... and the fact that this product claimed to help with anti aging was the icing on the cake... so I took it home and gave it a whirl.... its been about 2 1/2 weeks I have used this product 2x a day each day as it is not heavy and provides the extra moisture I need. I have noticed significant difference in the color and size of my scars. my skin feels smooth and soft. I feel good about this product sofar I have had no adverse reactions to this serum. With any product it takes a keen eye and diligence to becoming successful in your skincare goals. I will see how I feel about this product once I finish the bottle. If this product continues to show me positive gradual results I might purchase another product as this is cheap and effective.

They of course came in the super cute burlap looking drawstring sac like bag.<br /><br />It is very easy to use and self-explanatory you just spray the product into the palm of your hand and then rub your hands together until it is all absorbed.

I've had it now for two weeks and here's what I think...<br /><br />* The vacuum is great, period. When shaving with my Norelco T900, the shavings would fly all over the place --- in the sink, behind the faucet, in between the handles of the faucet, and on the floor. With the vacuum set on low, I barely see any clippings now! Now, my wife doesn't get mad any more!<br /><br />* The height adjustment can be easily set, and unlike other reviews mention, I haven't accidentally changed the setting without knowing.<br /><br />* The clipper works great and easily cuts/trims without any effort. This is an upgrade from my T900.<br /><br />* Battery holds its charge pretty well. You can use it with a power cord also when the battery is low.<br /><br />* The smaller trimmer is a now a separate attachment. My T900 has it attached to the trimmer, and it can be popped up or down when needed. To me, this is a downgrade as it is not as convenient.<br /><br />* The parts seem somewhat delicate. I try to be careful as to not cause damage.<br /><br />Overall, the price is good, it works well, and I'm glad I purchased it, and would recommend it to all.",[],B000FEF1V4,B000FEF1V4,AGJJRF6REVHJ4MNHG6AMCRBYYNZA,1194864647000,2,True

I don't have to worry about thicker compacts or powder boxes tripping up the drawer.<br /><br />This organizer is made of very durable and substantial material. It feels substantial as well and it holds a lot more than the other organizer. Now I can have a drawer for each type of makeup.

5.0,For now...Norelco's top of the line model,"I bought this electric razor about a year ago. I've been very happy with it's performance. I've never had any problems with it. The main reason I bought this was the battery life. It's rated @ 100 minutes, but mine charges to 110! This is also the quietest razor I've ever owned. (This spectra model replaced another norelco I had for about 10 years) Very solid stainless steel housing. You can rinse the heads off under hot tap water. The floating heads fits all of the curves of my face great. I like the cool polymer LED display. This razor is also fairly small in size, yet fits my hand well. It features a recessed steel on/off button. The one thing I don't like here is the pop- up trimmer, doesn't really cut effectively. Doesn't matter to me because I use another norelco cordless trimmer for close touch up work anyways. This model comes w/ a leather travel case.  You can't go wrong w/ the 8894XL, I recommend it.

4.0,Ehhh... they’re pretty good.,"There’s a learning curve. I’m relatively good with liquid liner, but the applicator brush for the magnetic eyeliner is junk. Next time I’ll try capping some product on glass and using my own brush to apply. The lashes are pretty good compared to other brands. The 5 magnets as opposed to 4 is nice. I had some trouble with the corners staying down. It’s a little tedious to get the liner timing and placement of the lashes just right.  Not the most comfortable, but what falsies are? The eyeliner is really difficult to remove even with eye makeup remover. A dab of coconut oil on a Qtip worked the best but did not entirely remove the product., which is why I took of a star. Last think I want when I remove makeup is any residue stuck on my face.<br /><br />To be fair, these are decent. They are not as nice as MoxieLashes, but they are also 1/3 of price. Compared to MoxieLash I’d rate them a solid three stars, but based on the price point, I’d say they are four stars.<br /><br />Sidenote: if you are ever needing a heavy duty waterproof eyeliner, you could use the magnetic liner with or withojr the lashes because it does not budge. Was surprised my to exit the shower after deep cleaning my face to find my eyeliner exactly perfect still. Not what I wanted at the time, but worth noting for when I need that kind of staying power.",[],B07W91RCLV,B07W91RCLV,AGNZCNXCQNWLSFEYWWWV4EHQZ6RA,1567463922595,3,True

5.0,My Favourite Product,"The first two or three days I used it all over my face I had a very MILD breakout and corner of my nose was a bit sensitive.  For this reason I started to use Niacinamide only the areas with enlarged pores, being my nose and top area of cheeks.  I did try using on my entire face and neck after a few days again and had no problem, I believe my skin just needed to get use to this product.  After applying Niacinamide over face and neck I apply Cerave Moisturizing Cream.  I use every night sometimes during the day,<br /><br />After a few days of using this product my skin looked the same but felt very soft and smooth.  After about a week skin still felt soft and smooth and began looking brighter…just healthier looking.  After just over 2 weeks my enlarged pored stared to look a little tighter.  After a month I decided I loved this product.  My pores never looked better and I don’t have that dry stinging feeling you get with Retionol.  A little goes a long way with this product.<br /><br />The product itself is water bases so it absorbs well and further blurs any blemishes including pores when on the skin. A little goes a long way, you only need a few drops. The reason I purchased this product was to use for my enlarged pores but I am very happy for the additional benefits.",[],B01MDTVZTZ,B01MDTVZTZ,AFLRNRBPSD46EYEYQN3UFW5C6DOQ,1628004496866,3,True

5.0,"Wake up to the sound of a clean, close shave.","I was shopping for replacement cutters and combs for a Norelco Micro Action (formerly Lift & Cut [formerly Rotatract]) shaver and noticed that for less than $10 more I could have a whole new  Norelco shaver. I was sold.<br /><br />Norelco Reflex Plus shavers combine 4 features pioneered by Norelco and improved over time. Rotary heads reduce the vibration common to reciprocating shavers. Floating heads individually hug the skin. Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave. Everything rides on a set of pivoting platforms that bulge slightly at the center of the head assembly.  The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.<br /><br />I've been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn't a surprise for my skin. It was as close and comfy as I'd expect from a Norelco.<br /><br />The real revelation was the sound. The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black & Decker DustBuster. The Reflex Plus is so quiet, you can actually hear the cutters slice off the whiskers and then fall silent on the next pass over the same area. This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn't nearby. You could actually shave by the sound alone!<br /><br />A somewhat poignant note: Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind. When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie. Still, I miss seeing the words ""MADE IN HOLLAND"" on the bottom of every Norelco I've owned.<br /><br />Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.",[],B00009RB0X,B00009RB0X,AHCTG4AAR44R5GL7O7HOMMLMRHCQ,1123160622000,117,False

5.0,A+ Great item. Used daily not always as a steamer but works great for stick straight hair.,"A+ Recommended. My family member uses it, not personally. She uses it daily for mainly combing and straightening her hair. Gets hot quick, less than 30 secs. Used on long around 12-18 inch black, thick, full set of hair. Used after showering with damp hair mostly and works fine. Uses it as a brush/comb. Steam is used when her hair is dry. We had a hard time finding distilled water with all the shortages. So this review took us a month to complete. Normal everyday use is great on her thick rebellious hair. We don't use the steam as often but works great when hair is dry and needs moisture to brush. Great accessory or upgrade to your regular combing/brushing. Some parts are hard to get too, without a mirror or hard reach areas, like behind your head. Hope this helps. If you buy a gallon of distilled water its plenty for occasional use.",[],B09P9HMMLM,B09P9HMMLM,AH7SOGZTXCMBIC5RAKF2U6TPF33A,1650562149936,0,True

2.0,This is not the miracle you want it to be.,"I really loved this product for the first two days... after that... not so much. I had really high hopes for it so I went into it with a positive attitude. I've been using it for weeks now so I feel like I can write an accurate review. First of all, it tells you to use 30 pumps on your hair if you have long hair. That is basically the whole bottle... so if you can afford to spend $30 on every shampoo, maybe it will work better for you. I used one pump on the top of my hair, one pump on the bottom and then after I rinsed it out, one more pump to leave on my ends. The first two days it made my hair look supermodel perfect... after that, it was so disgustingly greasy that I couldn't handle it. I started to work back a shampoo into my routine here and there to help with that- but now every single time I use it, its nothing but grease and weighed down matted down hair. Also, my hair is back to frizzy and not shiney... I would not recommend spending the money on this.

4.0,"A beautiful, natural, dewy finish..","Let me start by saying, I did NOT order this from Amazon.  I ordered it from Sephora.  The reviews here regarding whether this product was a fake or not made me a little leery.  So, I'm reviewing the real Josie Maran Vibrancy foundation and not the Amazon version, real or not.<br /><br />As usual, I ordered the lightest shade, RG5.  It's a nearly perfect match.  It's described as being for fair skin with neutral undertones.  I typically prefer foundations with pink undertones, but this actually worked really well for me.<br /><br />The consistency is on the thin, runny side, which isn't surprising since oil is an ingredient.  Having said that, this foundation sits on the skin so beautifully.  It looks like real skin.  It's definitely not a matte foundation, so if that's your preference, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation gives you more luminous, dewy-looking skin.  I don't typically care for dewy foundations, but again, I was surprised to like this one.  It just made my skin look healthy and plump.  It didn't look at all heavy, which is great because it didn't settle into my fine lines.  I did notice it took a while to set.  Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.

3.0,Takes a lot of work to look good...,"3.5 stars<br /><br />I have many thoughts on this wig.  We ordered this to compliment my daughter's Mad Hatter Halloween costume and honestly, it looked like a hot mess when it arrived.  The bangs were going everywhere, the curls were tangled, there was no part...it was awful.<br /><br />My daughter, who is 12, has long, VERY thick blonde hair.  When the wig arrived, we tried it on with her hair down to make sure it fit.  It did.  Fast forward to Halloween...I braided her hair and pulled it into a knot at the back of her head.  Lo and behold, the wig wouldn't fit...it just kept sliding off her head.  That was my mistake...I should have tested it with a bun when it arrived.  Having said that, my daughter is incredibly petite...her doctor predicts she won't surpass 5' when she's full grown  Obviously, her head isn't that large.  My point?  If you're an adult or are purchasing this for a teen or big child, it likely won't fit.  I finally had to put her hair in a low bun at the nape of her neck to make it work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because her natural hair was so low, we couldn't do the up-do we had planned because her bun showed if we did.  We ended up leaving it down, brushing it out, putting bobby pins in strategic places to help it frame her face and to contain it, and then I hair sprayed it in place.  Styling was especially difficult because the wig is sparse.  It's a lot of work to hide the netting underneath.  The netting is a yellow-beige color and stands out like bright white against the purple and teal.  We finally got it looking decent though, and she actually got many compliments on it throughout the evening, hence the higher star rating despite all the complaints.<br /><br />Once the wig was brushed and styled, the waves looked beautiful.  Just don't buy this expecting it to look great out of the box.  It won't.  It takes work.",[],B00UHEK7UW,B00UHEK7UW,AGFHHZIEFIIXJZKWRCLKISPPFGWQ,1509559362409,1,True

I usually buy it from the salons or from trusted sellers on Ebay for a much more reasonable price.  Having said that, I really like this shampoo.  It smells amazing, the lather is plentiful and silky, and I can genuinely say that my hair does feel a bit thicker.  While I don't think this shampoo has caused new hair growth, I do feel as if it's strengthened each individual strand to give my hair a slightly fuller look.  Don't get me wrong...it's not an Earth-shattering change, but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars is because every single shampoo bottle I have ever purchased has been faulty.  They leak, the pump either breaks or doesn't work from the start, and the plastic is flimsy.  If it's been mailed to me, it inevitably leaks all over the package and I lose a substantial amount of product, which is pretty frustrating.<br /><br />Overall though, a great product!",[],B000NHZSKC,B000NHZSKC,AGFHHZIEFIIXJZKWRCLKISPPFGWQ,1497805761359,2,False

Don't purchase extra cases from ScentBird, buy these instead.<br /><br />--- --- ---<br />These cases fit my ScentBird purfumes PERFECTLY. I actually prefer the bottle and mister that comes with these cases to the ones I get in my subscription.<br /><br />Do not put your case near things that can scratch it up.

Then gently took the lace mask out of the package and peeled the backing off. The mask is loaded with product on it and I didn't waste a bit and put excess from the bag on my hands and arms as well. I padded the mask down on my face and attached the part for you ears to secure it on your face. Then went to relax for the next 15-20min and enjoyed the feeling. When you take the mask off do not wash off the serum instead run it into your face.<br /><br />I've never used this brand before but I'm officially hooked! I've just turned 30 so I'm taking my skin care more seriously these days and very happy I found these masks. It's been a week since I've used it and my face is still feeling and looking great. I've started to purchase their other masks to see what I like best. I have nothing bad to say about this product it worked very well for me and I did notice a difference in my face.

The edges of the teeth are cut a whole lot sharper than is entirely necessary. This makes this particular comb catch more than it would have otherwise. The wood is nicely finished and it’s generally well made. Just went a bit too far with the milling.<br />Also, while the case is a nice gesture, it’s really on the cheesy side. As far as storage goes, it’s not much help. The velveteen sleeve is adequate for throwing it in a drawer or bag.<br />I considered getting another and sending this back, but really didn’t want to go through the whole process again.

4.0,"Better then most at this price point, depends on which one you get","So it's honestly not bad at this price point. It sheds a bit but all units have some shedding. For the mix brown I give 4 stars.The face front is about 2 inches and is meant to be cut and plucked for a natural look. I did neither in the photo. I just folded it under the the front as I'm afraid that cutting will make it look lifted in the front and obviously show it's a wig without some glue to put it down. The color is not exactly what I wanted. I was hoping it would be a darker brown. It's kinda a mousey brown and alittle strange in my opinion. It will need to be restyle in the front as some waves/curls flattened out by how it was packed in transport. The part is both a plastic fake skin and a mesh on top. You can see the mesh upon close examination. Makeup might help to conceal this.... Or make it worse. What I did like was the fullness and length. The weft was not too easy to be seen even when pulling hair apart. This is good compared to other brands where the wefts are often very visible, especially in the back and crown of a unit. Because the simulated scalp is narrow, you won't be able to change the part. It's also a bit flat near the part so it's gonna take some work to give a bit of volume. I would have enjoyed this much more had the color been a rich brown and if the scalp was a bit more realistic. Would I wear in public? Probably not. Would this be good for photo shoots or costumes ? yes. Would I buy other colors from this brand? Yes and I haven't done that with other brands on Amazon. For the purple ombre: I give 3 stars. It doesn't have the lace in front. This is more pure costume. The black is very shiney and the front of wig where the part is shows a bit of the black backing for construction. If it laid more flat and had the lace I would have given the purple ombre 4 stars. Dull the shiney with some powder like dry shampoo or maybe even dark eyeshadow. The fake scalp is actually better on the purple ombre compared to the brown mix. The ombre for the blonde is also a 4 star. Hair at the crown is a bit flat but the rest of the style is beautiful. The brown to blonde has the 2 inch lace like the long brown one. It's not as full on the head but you don't see the wefts unless you pull it apart a bit.  I feel the color is much more realistic. Hair feels pretty good for a synthetic. Note if you play too much , it will get a knotty feel. Again, good for photos. Some people might actually wear it daily but I don't know if it took take daily abuse. Length is great.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ILx3h4CrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url':

3.0,Very flat top. Some fried pieces under the wig.,"So I felt they did a good job of hiding the weft and had alot of hair. The unit shed pretty bad just by touching it though. The hair was shiney but powder should control that. The length was there. It had one spot near the bangs that looked like someone fried it. And that would be hard to conceal. The bangs looked nicer then most but it just wasn't for me. Fake scalp also not best I've seen but concealer would probably fix that. The top had no volume and I don't mean amount of hair. It was slicked down really tight. I tried to shake it a bit with my fingers to see if it would gain some life but it didn't, plus a bunch of hair fell out.  This super flat look near the fake scalp and with a mid part that cannot be moved is just gonna make me look like the Amish. I would look at this company again if they had a unit without the bangs and maybe a more flexible part. A mini front lace would probably help.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1XhCuPw+6S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1XhCuPw+6S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1XhCuPw+6S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YNvQSajTS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YNvQSajTS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YNvQSajTS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1f3K+ACWqS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1f3K+ACWqS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1f3K+ACWqS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1nkAEpwqBS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1nkAEpwqBS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1nkAEpwqBS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C10MVo3Av8S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C10MVo3Av8S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C10MVo3Av8S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B095LS4NR5,B095LS4NR5,AFUBMCVI5J6G4F2RFQGTDRXLE6VQ,1623495007235,0,True

The magnetic is strong so I'm sure it won't fall off, but it's so strong that when you start to move the under lash toward your eye with the upper lash laying on top of your lashes, the magnetic pulls and moves is soil quickly that it always ends up locked half way through your natural lashes. And I'm a contact wearer...so it's not like I have  fear of putting stuff near my eyes. These probably will work well with lash liners. The lashes themselves look nicely constructed. It's just the application as intended is impossible.",[],B089XX8C33,B089XX8C33,AFUBMCVI5J6G4F2RFQGTDRXLE6VQ,1600261524361,1,True

Which might work for some but didn't create the look I wanted for my Halloween costume.<br /><br />Overall not a bad product. I wasn't impressed with the magnet cat eye effect - it's very minimal and barely noticeable. The glow in the dark feature is pretty cool and works well.<br /><br />Pro Tip- after looking through the photo reviews: keep your layers thinner.

5.0,Recommended by my dentist!,"My dentist recommended I purchased a water flosser but the one he was selling in his office was almost $100! I looked them up and found that they were all considerably cheaper online. I’m extremely happy with this one! The best feature is that it’s cordless (with the exception of when it’s charging, of course). I’ve had mine for a few weeks and I’ve only had to plug it in once so the charge is lasting. For those of you who’ve never used a water flosser before, they can be powerful and messy (with water getting everywhere) so it’s best to keep and use them in the shower so that the water is confined/contained inside the shower during use. This was actually my dentists recommendation – so this being a cordless flosser was very important! I usually get about 3 flosses in before having to refill the water reservoir (which is very simple). This one does come with several tips so I tried them all after settling on one. I think having several different options is nice so that you can find the pressure and kind of tip that works best for you and meets your own unique needs. Overall, I think this water flosser is great. It does exactly what I need it to do and I got it for a fraction of the price from the dentists office. I would confidently recommend it to others! For anyone looking to buy water flossers, I hope my review is helpful to you!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlaAOSKnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlaAOSKnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlaAOSKnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pyf9YZO6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pyf9YZO6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pyf9YZO6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pIWfj104L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pIWfj104L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pIWfj104L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qoAB0sAEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qoAB0sAEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qoAB0sAEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07W11NLFS,B07W11NLFS,AGZM7K3XER7QIXHLUUZ62Q47DN4Q,1576421263652,32,True

I have been going to a professional for months now and when the 2020 pandemic began and all service providers closed up shop,  I wasn't sure how I would deal with unwanted facial hair.  Where other methods of hair removal can encourage stronger hair regrowth I did not want to regress.  Then I found this!  I have had this product several weeks now and am very happy with it.  I wish I had found this earlier.  Not only can I do a treatment whenever I want, I am able to target hairs when they first appear as opposed to waiting for an appointment.  It is very easy to use.  I was afraid I would be unable to target the follicle in the right spot but that has not been a problem.  It has a high pitch buzz when the current is delivered to the follicle.  Most of the time the sound is my only indication that anything is happening.  I do not find this painful.  I can tell it is working because when I go to remove the hair it comes out with no effort.  I do keep the power at the highest setting except for the delicate area above the upper lip.  That can be a painful area at home or at the salon.<br /><br />My only complaint with the product is that the tweezers included are useless.  Just use your own.<br />I bent the stylist at first so I did order extras to have in case that happens again... so far so good as I haven't ruined another.  I don't think that is a product flaw as it must be very delicate to do the job right... just be careful.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with electrolysis, do not expect that one shot will forever kill a hair.  I suggest reading articles on the subject as this can be a long term process.  But considering other methods are a FOREVER process... go for it !",[],B00011JN5G,B00011JN5G,AEFIS7PTIVLTRM4CLEZEPJJHC5SQ,1586700039887,8,True

4.0,My hubby likes his new shaver,"My husband has complained about shaving irritating his skin, so when I saw this shaver I ordered one for him. Here is what he had to say after using it:<br /><br />I've used Norelco shavers for years, but never a ""wet"" system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver. When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner. This was no problem following the easy to read instruction manual.<br /><br />To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button. This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads. Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver. I found that I use three pumps of conditioner while shaving: one for each side of my face and one for my neck.<br /><br />Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin. Because of this, in recent years I've starting shaving every other day. So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men's would normally be. The shaver has no problem coping with this. It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs. However, it begins to have problems with three days of growth.<br /><br />I also have a mustache and goatee, which has always caused me to use a razor to shave along its edge. The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry skin.<br /><br />The shaver also comes with a beard trimming device. Just snap off the triple shave head and replace it with the trimmer. (Conditioner cannot be used when the trimmer is installed.) The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless. It just doesn't want to cut any hairs. But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.<br /><br />I also find the conditioner application button is in a position that I want to place my fingers when using the shaver, so occasionally I'll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner. A pretty minor issue.<br /><br />The Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I'm blind as a bat without my glasses on.<br /><br />I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception: ­ there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.

I took the leap because I had previously tried soap from this company, that I purchased first from a National Park.  I loved it!  It worked wonderfully and smelled great, not soapy.  I then moved on to try a hair shampoo from this company.  I love the natural clean from this as well.  So, to the tooth soap, it cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling clean for a long time.  The clean feels more real than some other pastes that cover a grimy feeling with strong essential oils.  Another way this soap exceeds my expectations is that in reading the description and reviews I anticipated that what i was getting would last about a month, brushing 2-3 times a day.  There is far more in the small jar than I knew.  And a small piece goes a long way.  I break each piece in half before using.",[],B00XRUBGZ8,B00XRUBGZ8,AEBFWXLPRG3MPWJXFDWMLOPJ4BLQ,1497639263884,0,True

Even when hair ties don't pull my hair they end up with hair stuck on them so they must have even if I didn't feel it.  These did not do that.  They also are not too tight to wear on your wrist.  They don't stretch a ton which seems weird that they'd stay in your hair but they coil in.

I know some brands aren’t and that’s probably fine in a store (though I still prefer sealed in this day and age) but the screw cap was just taped to keep it from unscrewing in travel.  Taping worked fine but some still leaked and the box smelled of nail polish remover.

4.0,"Light, daily primer","I was a little leary about a spray but it feels so refreshing to spray on.  It also makes it much easier to use a light amount.  Considering the light amount you use, the size of this bottle is going to last FOREVER.  This really makes me more likely to use it daily vs just when going out.  It really does make a nice smooth surface to apply makeup to and reduces the powdering or blotchy look of your makeup.<br /><br />Do not let “moisturizing” fool you though, this isn’t like a bb cream, you do still need a separate moisturizer.  Also keep in mind it is “minimizing”, it doesn’t make your pores magically and completely disappear, especially if you have any enlarged pores.  It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn’t touch.<br /><br />I’ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.  I think this makes a good every day primer.  And since I still use a separate moisturizer that has spf I don’t have to worry about this not having it.  Between the affordable cost and the refreshing feel and scent this has definitely converted me to a daily primer user.",[],B07QN8CGPL,B07QN8CGPL,AFUKCEULW4KYMWRQCVGI6K3WTVUA,1563388273645,12,False

5.0,Best Nails I've Tried- Very Good Fit For Me,"Having tried many fake nail tops, I know they fit differently for everyone. I feel very lucky that this particular set fits my nail bed very well- so much so that I barely have to file them to fit, and they conform to the curvature of my nail as well. These are on the slightly thinner side, which I prefer, because they feel and look a lot more natural on top. The length is perfect too- not too long.<br /><br />I lightly buffed the top of these and painted them w regular nail polish. If I polish without buffing, they can crinkle a bit - I have not tried gel yet tho, and that probably will work out w a clear top if I want to keep the white tip look. Even without polish, the buffed look just looks like a beautiful pink matte polish, as if I had painted them that way on purpose. Some commenters have said the white part scratches off somewhat easily. This is true. But, I love these for the natural look and great fit, and am buying another set now, so I never run out.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7124A1M1H8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7124A1M1H8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7124A1M1H8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Z938SD2,B07Z938SD2,AFATNFWGYVVMEZWGDNLDUXRBRFLQ,1581649393075,0,True
5.0,"Very Good For Some Purposes, Difficult For Others","I have about 5 different colors of this Mofajang Hair Color Wax Temporary Hairstyle Cream, and I purchased them before I got this gray sample to try. what I like about these products is that they add a temporary color to my already light grey hair- such as a pink or purple tinge or even a darker gray or darker blue gray...you get the picture. This easily adds a pastel color to my lighter hair with a smallish amount of product.  I could see that to change up dark hair or to get a strong/intense color tone, you'd need to pile this stuff on, and I think that's where this gets a bad rap. Yes, you can glob this on to higher opacity and change your dark colored hair to the color shown in the jar. BUT, you need a lot to do this, and you may not like the sticky, waxy result -it is wax, after all. If you are using a little bit (about a quarter sized blob) and adding this through your washed and wet hair and then blow dry, your hair will still move naturally and have the lighter tone of the product, provided your hair was fairly light to begin with-- just my two cents.",[],B07HHZBH4X,B07HHZBH4X,AFATNFWGYVVMEZWGDNLDUXRBRFLQ,1579681462222,2,False

This has a pressurized lever that provides a longer spray with one squeeze. The mist is fine, but not quite as fine as I was hoping- it's more granular than a steamer or vibration dispenser (like cool mist vaporizers), but this is manual, so I guess I'm complaining for no reason. For a hand pump spray, this is a very good (fine) spray overall.  They recommend that you not put anything but water in the device, and I'm guessing that may be due to it being easy to clog.

5.0,OMG! I'm in LOVE!!!,"Ok...I'm going to try to not write a novel here, but I am sooo in love with these polishes!!!  I read a ton on reviews on these peel off polishes and finally chose these not expecting a whole lot. I have 100% no complaints!!! But I will say that I guess it all depends on what you are wanting out of your nail polish. If you are wanting it to last like it lasts on artificial nails... this is not for you. If you are wanting options and to not have to deal with nail polish remover...THIS IS FOR YOU!!!<br /><br />I have loved painting my nails and having polished nails since a kid. I've always hated nail polish remover. I have thin nails and can't change my polish often because nail polish remover dries my nails out and makes them even weaker and it stinks...even nail polish stinks for that matter.<br />To make the polish last I've always added a top coat about every day or two and I've learned how to do touch ups that hardly show when the polish on tip of the nail (natural nails) chipped or wore away, so that I didn't have to use acetone any more often than necessary. But it was really self defeating because the more polish I had on, the more acetone I had to use to remove it.<br />So anyway...I got these little gems in...they are small....but then again, when you compare the price to buying regular polish ( I buy OPI normally ) and the fact that you are getting several colors of these for the price you'd pay for 1 or 2 bottles of decent regular polish, it's not a bad deal at all.<br />I tried them right away and<br />#1...they are hardly smell at all! I don't smell them unless I actually hold my nails or the bottle to my nose to smell them.<br />#2...the polish went on fine. It's a little thick, but it settles down smooth as it dries.<br />#3 I love some of the colors and some will be just for having fun, but they are fun t play with. 5 colors are opaque and 4 are transparent, so they are fun mixing and matching. I like using the transparent ones as top coats on the opaque ones.<br />#4 They lasted about 3 days with no chips and very very little edge wear (with the daily addition of a top coat for shine) until I couldn't stand it any longer and had to try to peel them off. Some of the reviews said they were hard to peel off, but I had no problem at all. And all but one came off in one full piece! Amazing!!! So easy and NO ACETONE!!! And the other thing I like is that with regular polish, I would sometimes try and peel of as much as I could before using the acetone and some would come off but my nail always seemed super dry under the polish even when it was peeled off. That is not the case with these at all. My nails were not dry at all. They were still healthy and not dry at all!!!<br />Oh and the BONUS ....since they peel off, any polish that gets on to your skin peels off easy too after it dries. :)",[],B07N36NMKJ,B07N36NMKJ,AGQXE4KNPXLJG22Q2FQZJVW3JE6A,1583624197300,6,True

Anyways, I tried turning it on, where I assumed was the correct way going off of the photo, well, it worked, but it took great force to work. If my roommate didn’t show me how to turn it in, I would’ve kept turning it on that way, without being the wiser.<br /><br />Now that I’ve finally figured out how to turn it on correctly I put it to use.

I don't know if the pictures actually do them justice, but they're very sparkly and look like 'real' nail polish.<br /><br />They're extremely easy to apply but are very stretchy and can tear easily, if you don't take your time. Just be careful when you apply them. Once in place, I smoothed the polish strip down with my thumb and then gently slid a soft tipped orange stick over it to make sure that all the air bubbles were out and that the polish strip was securely in place. The package also includes a mini nail file so that you can file off the excess and get into the corners of your nails, which may be hard to do with a larger nail file.

4.0,"Great eye pillow for relaxation, headaches and puffy eyes!","I've been looking for something just like this, so when I was given the opportunity to review it, at a discounted cost, I jumped at it.<br /><br />First off, I wouldn't really consider this an eye mask for sleeping. It's great to place over your eyes or forehead for relaxing, headaches, itchy/watery/puffy eyes but without a strap to keep it on your face, I wouldn't sleep with it on.<br /><br />When I first took it out of the package, I was met with a powerful smell of lavender, so I knew that this definitely had enough potency to last for a while.<br /><br />Heat: After it was heated, the smell was initially little overpowering but after a while, it faded. It says to lightly spritz the mask and then heat it for 30 seconds in the microwave, which I did, but since it didn't feel hot enough, I put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds and, for me, that was the perfect temperature.<br /><br />Cold: I tried freezing it to use on my eyes, since my allergies have been killing me this season and my eyes have been quite puffy and itchy, and I must say that I was rather pleased. It was cool, but definitely not too cold to place directly on my skin/eyes to soothe them. This time around, I could barely smell the lavender.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product but I wish the company had also enclosed a nice bag to seal the eye mask in when you're done using it. In the directions, it says to keep it in a sealed bag to help keep the lavender smell last longer so I had assumed that they would have included one with it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but it does not change my opinion of the product.",[],B00X04M31C,B00X04M31C,AEFEPQYRCUM5EIE32QEMG6UJPVUQ,1448291220000,1,False

5.0,Fabulous Product/Especially W/ Chemo Hair Changes,"I have tons of other brands & products in<br />my linen closet/toiletries closet, but this is all I use now; been fighting terminal cancer for eight years as of 1/2023 (had hair/didn’t have hair/had completely different texture & color afterward several different types of hair, back to kind of smooth hair???). My hair has repeatedly changed during my many medications & various treatments & a bone marrow transplant. My college senior daughter♥️ (Let’s Go Mountaineeeeeers!💙💛💙) found this, loved it, & brought some home for me. I was skeptical because of the ridiculous price. However, I tried it & have used nothing else since. I’ve purchased it repeatedly. If you have fine or thinning hair, this may not be for you as it might weight it down? My hair has always been thick, but straight & soft & medium brown with highlights (W/F). Not now. It grew back a different color, totally different VERY coarse texture, dry, super dark & unruly, some very wiry gray, not to mention frizzy-curly like Bozo the Clown. Not pretty curls. Fuzzy, wiry uncontrollable uneven tight curls. It was terrible looking, but the least of my worries. I wore it proudly through my hair stages…completely bald, “prickly just starting to grow” hair about a millimeter long, “mange dog patches” of baldness hair combined with clumps of downy soft hair, &, of course, my Bozo uneven curls. This is the only thing that keeps it soft, but doesn’t leave it feeling dry OR greasy (like that ‘not rinsed out all of the way’ feeling). Yes, it’s absurdly expensive, but I will keep buying it because it hydrates great & smells nice. I will get my joy wherever I can find it these days because life’s too short not to! My daughter is awesome & I thank her for finding this!!! (PS: This was the shampoo/conditioner small combo pack).",[],B0BL8L74P6,B0BL8L74P6,AEXVFV7S2UEDK3WVCHWMQLEYH3ZQ,1675225017655,2,True

Consistanly bad, or consistantly good, but always be consistant.&#34;  This product, so far is NOT consistant and at this price people are going to expect to receive the same product for the money spent.<br />Another thing that bothers me about this company besides the inconsistant product line is with every product you order they send a card stating &#34;contact us&#34; - Tell us what you think and we will respond with a coupon code for 10%-50% off your next Amazon order.  I have 4 products, 2 More Than Clean and 2 - 100% Confident (I have not yet opened the 2nd bottle of this, so I don't know if it is the same as the first.

Anyone who has had a previous Norelco product points this out.<br /><br />2)  a ridiculously designed sideburn trimmer - It is so hard to get the trimmer set-up!  a poor design<br /><br />3)  A terrible cut - if you have even a medium beard, the trimmer is very uneven. you can certainly do better.<br /><br />The items above are enough to walk away from this device.  The reviews that critique the vaccuum are probably being unrealistic.  It is in part Norelco's fault - they set you up to expect more from the vaccuum than you get.

I never thought I would even consider something light weight or sheer. But now as a mom, barely have time for my glam makeup, & wanted something to protect my aging skin this stuff is great! IM 26 but want to start taking care of my skin better. I’m usually the color porcelain but wanted something with color. The natural glow gave me that sun kissed glow without looking orange. Non shimmery what-so ever. Matt but non drying, no oily texture. Gave me such a natural glow. GORG! I wore this all day for Easter at the park (never thought I wouldn’t wear foundation to a family event!) & got tons of compliments how I look refreshed. I’m glowing & my skin hasn’t looked better! I will 100% be buying this for as long as they continue this product!<br /><br />2 MONTH UPDATE: Still am amazing product! Use it almost everyday now.

5.0,the BEST for anything from subtle shimmer to hard chrome,"This palette has become one of my favorite nail tools. I've been using it mostly on acrylic dip powder, but have also used it on top of traditional polish with a clear coat on top. if you apply a light/thin layer (or on dip powder base that has NOT been buffed), it adds a subtle shimmer. If you apply it more thickly AND buff it with the eyeshadow-type applicator, you can achieve a solid chrome look that's really fun as well. I enjoy putting it on all my nails, or just on one nail for a fun accent look that still matches my overall color scheme. I've also enjoyed using it on a relatively plain nail for a fine-textured glitter look while other nails have full-texture glitter. It's really a lot of fun and goes a super long way (basically as far as a comparable eyeshadow palette would go). Strongly recommended<br /><br />UPDATE: I've ditched my acrylic powders (long story - I kayak too much) but couldn't let go of this shimmer. Turns out it works on traditional nail polish as well. You can apply it directly on top for a chrome effect, or BUFF (not file) the surface gently then apply for a soft shimmer. In both cases top with clearcoat.

I love wiping my face off with this warm cloth each day, and am always surprised how it even removes 95% of my waterproof mascara. I've compared eyemakeup removal by using this on one side and my liquid ""eye makeup remover"" on the other, and the two sides typically look nearly the same, though I look a teensy bit better on this side... so if I follow up by removing the rest of the mascara the usual way, I usually only get a teensy bit of grey on the Q-tip (rather than the usual solid black I get when I haven't pre-treated with this cloth). So it's not 100%, but I'm astonished that it gets more than 3% of the waterproof stuff off, since usually that won't budge.

4.0,another solid epilator from Braun (plus no more underarm bumps!),"Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:<br />* Removes smaller hairs (0.5mm) than older models, so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back<br />* The ""massagers"" on the epilation head really do help<br />* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won't work)... and I must say that using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort, although it's a bit harder to notice stray hairs<br />* You can't use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower!) but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you'll have to toss the unit)<br />* I wish this included a trimming head like other models, for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack (they have to be 7 mm or shorter before this will really pull them out)<br />* This doesn't include an attachment for facial hair like some do (which is OK)... just make sure that your epilator is clean if you're going to use it on your face, because otherwise it will make you break out<br />* The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed<br />* The exfoliating brush is a nice touch, because epilating frequently leads to ingrown hairs. It says to use it a day or two before epilating, and it's super-gentle... almost feels like it's not doing anything, but I found it's more effective and more comfortable (if more slow) than just using a loofah. The ""wait 2 days"" advice is good because otherwise your skin gets sensitive<br /><br />And some thoughts on epilation in general:<br />* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it's very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren't bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.)<br />* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you'll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back but are still too small to get. It's less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren't really visible. So if you think someone's going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don't bother doing anything for a month or so, you'll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.<br />* Remember that the exfoliation is important to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don't turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you'll have to do that anyway. And this unit's exfoliator is more gentle than a loofah<br />* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they'll banish them but don't? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it's fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time",[],B00AX3YNPC,B00AX3YNPC,AEGZUGS74AIXKND3LQEAZAS4NVNA,1366578528000,65,False

5.0,Great job.  Feels solid and sturdy.  Not too noisy.,"Long ago I went with Sonicare at my dentist's suggestion.  Got this Oral B and have to say it is giving my Sonicare a run for the money.  I like the feel of it.  I like the red light that flashes when you are applying too much pressure.<br /><br />The 30 second alert is similar in both units.<br /><br />The one thing I really like is that this brush keeps on going once you reach the two minute mark.  The Sonicare stops.  So if I want to spend a few more seconds on a couple of back teeth just to make sure I don't have to turn this on again.  I just continue.  I like that.<br /><br />They probably do a similar job in cleaning.  Over the years I have benefitted from using this type of brush.  One plus is that you need to do the 2 minute cleaning.

It sits in the corner of my bathroom and mocks me. Everything that could break on these ""things"" does and there is no recourse. The entire thing is made in China and it is crap. The manual is literally translated probably by a Chinese person and it makes no sense what so ever. It started breaking in less than a year and nothing is operational. The steam generator has a hole in it and is not repairable, I spent many $100's trying to figure out what was wrong with it. The sauna stove broke and only one element worked, it took forever to heat and the new stove they sent me flips my breaker within 5 minutes of turning it on. This is the worst purchase on the internet, all of these units are. I am not alon. Many many unhappy customers out there. A lot of these companies just disappear after awhile and start new under a different name. Don't be sucked into the sleekness of these things.

The formula advertises to be sweat proof/waterproof, but that is definitely not the case. I wore this and sweated when I wrote my initial review, but after getting wet in the rain, this product seemed to disappear (my reason for removing a star). It has a natural look to it with a 4-fork tip head that lets you create more realistic looking brows. This gets 3 stars for its wearability and durability and application. The formula goes on quite dry so you really have to work in applying yet so it looks even on both brows. However, I like the color and the fork applicator.

Pros: Will not weigh fine/thin lashes down or flatten them like some super wet mascaras will do. It is also buildable. Cons:  If takes multiple applications to add real volume and thickness to your lashes.<br /><br />This mascara did not cause any irritation or sensitivity and it stayed put all day long (even when sweating). It’s also easy to remove with a waterproof eye makeup remover.<br /><br />I didn’t notice this mascara helping curl my lashes.

The shaver also comes with a pop-up trimmer. Simply push a button on the back of the shaver and a trimmer pops up so that you can shave your neck and around ears.

It'd be the perfect thing to chill and use at night to soothe redness in your face, or even to help relieve sinus pressure.<br /><br />This roller has the perfect shape to smoothly roll across the contours of your face. Overall, construction seems sturdy, but this one does make some noise while rolling due to the metal on the rock. If it's important that your jade roller is silent, this isn't the one with you.

Whether using the deep clean mode or the one for sensitive teeth both have improved my oral hygiene greatly.  I was very impressed that the deep clean mode wasn't too intense.  My dentist is thrilled.  My gums have come back to new life a healthy pink and are no longer sensitive.  And my teeth?  The plaque removal here is superb and my sensitive teeth have improved more with this brush than with any desensitizing paste I have used.  My dentist said it is because the brush is doing what it needs to do and not stressing the teeth by using a faster speed that is just not necessary.<br /><br />Everything else about this electric toothbrush I found to be very user friendly as well.

4.0,Heats up quickly.,"[[VIDEOID:1998f82c98c1bbb520f99c753a936492]] The latest hair craze if the hair straightening brush, and I will admit to having one, using it, and loving it. The only thing that I have disliked about it is that it is a little heavy, and since my hair is super curly, I have to run it through my hair a lot, and my hand does get tired. Even if I'm rotating hands, it still takes a really long time. Even though my hair is short, it's just really thick and curly. So I don't love straightening it, and my go-to when I am straightening my hair had been the straightening brush. But I actually like this one better.<br />The LED screen is very easy to read, even while in use. The hair brush bristles are very nice, and seemingly durable as none of them broke off while I was straightening my hair. And again, it's not as heavy as the hair straightening brushes that has been the latest craze.<br />Its very user friendly, and it heats up super fast. The rotating cord is a nice feature, I don't think that I would ever straighten my hair if I had to constantly untangle the cord. That's just another frustration that doesn't even need to be added on, in my opinion. But that's a nice design.<br />When you are curling your hair, keep the black piece on the curler facing your head, otherwise it will be a MESS. If you have super curly hair like I do, it will be PERFECT for taming down your curls, which is exactly how I use it.<br />Also, don't use this on your hair if its wet. Just wait until it's dry, I get an eye twitch when I see somebody or hear somebody straightening their hair when it's wet. It does nothing but kill your hair, causes split ends, and you can't come back from something like that. So, just wait until your hair is dry.<br />Make sure your hair also has ZERO tangles otherwise it WILL get stuck and THAT is no fun at all. Tiny strands will also be best, unless you like untangling your hair...<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review.",[],B01DVH07YM,B01DVH07YM,AHKCM6JME3JF3MNM5QSTAZEGHKVA,1461973603000,1,False

5.0,"Great, sheer sunscreen for super sensitive skin","Some people think they have sensitive skin - they just don't know what sensitive skin really is. I have SENSITIVE skin - I was sensitized to certain ingredients by a medical saga and, hoo boy, if you put the wrong thing on me I will break out in a rash so thick you'd think my face was made of napa leather. This ""Kid Cream"" is one of the only sunscreens I've found that I can use consistently without having a horrible reaction. Bonus points: it spreads on totally sheer, has a dry touch, and it stays on. It works on my face without breakouts, it works on my body without being seen. Indeed, the only downside is that it stays on so well it takes some scrubbing to get it all the way off!

4.0,It does a better job than brushing with regular tooth brush.,"Although I never had good experiences with Philips' products, and with other electric toothbrush brand like Braun oral B, and recently I found 20 bucks on the ground , so I don't really care if it does not last long, after reading some bad reviews that water gets inside the battery compartment, which I see is happening, but still I'm sure I'll find the way around it after the 2 years warranty expires.<br /><br />Now, for the intended job, cleaning your teeth, is much better than the moving action from Oral B Braun, the 2 minutes limit bothered me a bit, but it takes seconds to turn on again and back to the job. And I do feel my teeth more slippery after using it.<br /><br />The included batteries lasted for 3 weeks and the unit won't operate as powerful as with a new fresh set of batteries, this thing is really powerful. So , don't judge the unit's power with the batteries supplied.<br /><br />The handle is one of the reason I took one star off, it becomes very slippery and when you need to turn around the toothbrush you need to use both hand, so it does not fall from my hand, unless you are not like me, that I realized that I use my other hand to lean on the sink, probably won't find it awkward, but otherwise is not big deal.<br /><br />If it fail, I will update this review and let you know how not surprised I was.",[],B000FEIOHW,B000FEIOHW,AE6PPMN2FGEOPFEQ3WWDPK4JFPYA,1348873336000,0,True

5.0,Amazing product - for thick hair too,"OK, let me say that I was very skeptical at first, and here's why:  I saw that someone mentioned a lot of people were given a free product for their review and I was worried a lot of the good reviews were biased.  Then I saw this one review mentioning that it doesn't work on thick hair.  But I thought there were thousands of good reviews, and at least majority of those would be true.  So I ordered it to give it a try.  I have thick hair, and let me say that it works great on mine!  It suds up nicely, and has the best aroma I have ever smelled (not too strong, but memorable).  If your hair is dirty and greasy, it works better if you put a little bit of shampoo and wash/rinse quickly first before putting more for a more thorough wash.  I think I am convinced and might be one of those lifers for the product from now on.

Perfjohn Anti Aging Snail Extract is full of good things, though I have no idea what snail extract is all about, but the serum is not sticky so I'm not worried.<br /><br /> I've been a fan of Vitamin C products for a while now and I really love how they make my skin feel.  This serum is just as lovely.  It goes on light, and I do have to be careful not to use more than a few drops because this serum really goes a long ways.  Normally I steer away from the department store beauty products because of their heavy scents, and this product does have a light scent, but it goes away almost immediately so it didn't affect my sinuses.<br /><br />I'm only in my first week of use, but it does moisturize well, goes on beautifully, and keeps my skin feeling perfect all day(I tend towards dry skin).

The tubes are TINY but a little dab goes a long way, so they seem to be a fair price. These whips add a nice glow to my cheeks that is great for date night with my hubby or going to a party or other event, but I would not use them on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the product separates in the container, so you have to shake it up REALLY well before you squeeze a little out onto your fingertip or makeup sponge. If you don't shake it (and even when you do half the time), you end up with a gush of shimmery liquid dripping over your finger before any of the actual color squirts out. Most of the &#34;shimmer&#34; in these shimmering facial whips has ended up in my sink rather than on my face.

5.0,Yes the Hair Grip Works,"I first saw this concept, Grip wrap for Wigs on Youtube. I searching on Amazon, I found many different makers, sellers.<br />I chose this one by the embroidered Logo (on the side) hoping for quality. They all resemble each other, quality didn't appear to be<br />the same, as you can find many of these for sale, names vary.<br /><br />My (Brown) Hair Grip arrived today. I have tried it with two different Wigs.<br />1. Outre Dominican Blow Out Color #2  Half Wig with back and front combs and adjustable strap<br />2. FreeTress Equal Evyln lace front in Taffy. 2 side temple combs, back comb and adjustable strap<br /><br />1. Outre: I did not need to use the front comb at all. I did apply the back comb, it's not necessary though.<br />I did it out of habit. The Half Wig is in it's natural place, snug, it's moveable yes, it's not going anywhere,<br />The Grip actually makes the wig look more natural upon my head, it pulls it inward as natural hair looks.<br /><br />The Hair Grip wrap works as intended, no combs required to keep the wig in place, snug.<br /><br />2. FreeTress Evyln Color Taffy. I did not use either side temple combs.<br />The Hair Grip I chose is dark brown.<br /><br />Taffy Evyln is a dark root, darkest brown, blonde ombre,<br />if you really stare hard you can slightly see the grip/wrap in the part.<br />You would have to know it's there to detect it. I do not believe anyone would see it outright.<br /><br />Again same result, The Hair Grip works as intended. The wig fit is snug, no way is it coming off.<br />Whatever the magic is with this The Hair Grip, it does enhance the actual fit of your wig in the positive.<br /><br />I am glad I chose the Dark Brown Hair Grip vs the Beige, the Black, my natural hair is Darkest Brunette.<br />The brown color for me will be the most versatile for longevity of use and wear.<br /><br />The actual fabric is very light, it's nearly weightless, it is not a velvet material.<br />The Velcro is soft to touch. I do not foresee it damaging my wig interiors, nor the hair either.<br /><br />The Hair Grip is Firm &#34; in place&#34; there is not a feeling that I am wearing a headband..<br />No ring around the head feel. It's adjustable too, you can lighten or pull tighter, the velcro is ample.<br />The attach part of Velcro is about 2 inches, the connect side of the Velcro is several inches, this<br />will fit all heads, I can't see how it wouldnt.<br /><br />Remember if you are wearing &#34; wide' part lace fronts,<br />Color will come into play, the Grip is going to be visible depending on Wig color nearest the part.<br /><br />I hope my review helps out, as it's a bit confusing with so many nearly same, yet not alike.<br /><br /> I am satisfied with my purchase, it is a worthy investment.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jn7Uxl5uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jn7Uxl5uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Jn7Uxl5uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XoY0AmgZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XoY0AmgZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XoY0AmgZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qQvwSjuZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qQvwSjuZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qQvwSjuZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00DUGZBH8,B00DUGZBH8,AHDJUR7I7UY3RFDNFGGQCUQBVRFA,1497468138846,8,True

You will have perfect eyebrows for one day and after that the hair stays dyed for about 5 days.<br /><br />For the price I'm very happy and will buy this again.

5.0,Good work at an incredible price,"I was pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied with this brush. First a note on the pics. I took the before pic on the left after hair had been washed, dried, brushed with a regular brush, with no product (oil, conditioner, balm, etc.) put into the beard. I then used the brush and took the pic before applying any product to style it. For something to straighten your beard quickly on days you don't wash it, this was very easy to use. It heats up fast (about a min) and within about 1-2 minutes, I was done.<br /><br />As you will notice, my beard is shorter on the sides and even my chin area isn't super long. I found the shorter bristles on this brush compared to bigger brushes meant for women's hair to work better for my beard. Also, I found it did a great job if you go slowly and comb UP from under the chin first. Then go back and brush it slowly down the other side. The extension cord is plenty long. The only downside of that is that it can make storage a challenge. I don't like wrapping the cord around the brush itself. So I had picked up some cheap velcro cord wraps from Amazon a few years ago and added one to the cord to make it easier to put away.<br /><br />I bought this to keep at the office. But for the price, I think I'll go back and pick up one more for the house and another to keep in my gym bag. I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to any guy with a short to medium beard.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dIxW7fA-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dIxW7fA-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dIxW7fA-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Le3erYwRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Le3erYwRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Le3erYwRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mNF5+hblL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mNF5+hblL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mNF5+hblL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sHsv-6gbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sHsv-6gbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sHsv-6gbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RLY4FTC,B07RLY4FTC,AGSKNLPIR7JGTZK6EKED2RURNSQQ,1581432209311,10,False

5.0,"Brilliant Idea, Great Clips, Needs More Colors","These are wonderful little containers for travel. They are very easy to fill and dispense from, when you are ready to use your lotion or shampoo or facial cleanser, but they are also the right size to give you enough for a trip. The bottles come in different colors, so you can sort of color-code your products, however, they don't include enough colors. As a result, there are really only four bottles that can be used for travel, without labeling. Given that three are the white color, all of those will be for hand lotion. They are really convenient for attaching to a hook on a bag, which is great for me because my hands dry out so easily. Since I know what color the original bottles are, for my products, I love that they are different colors, but, again, they need more colors. My shampoo is blue. My body wash is white. My facial cleanser is green. My lotion is orange. The list goes on. I am giving these five stars because they work very well, have a nice thick top portion to hold that clip, so that they don't break off, and the clips themselves are nice medium-duty clips that really hold the little bottles in place. These are high quality for a great price and made with food-grade silicone, so they are non-toxic and won't leach any chemicals into my products, which means I won't be putting anything bad on my skin. Even though you might have to separate them out, unless you use products with color additives like pink-colored strawberry scented shampoo, and only use four for travel, while the other two are for different use, they are still really well made and easy to fill and dispense and attach and carry around. I highly recommend these. I look forward to seeing more colors and more multi-color sets. That's basically what we all need isn't it, for everything to come in different sets with more choices as to customizing the variations in the sets that we purchase. Some would want all pink.  Some would want all blue. Some would want a rainbow.

4.0,"Smear-proof and long lasting, I love it!","I've bought three of these now, the Baby Brown, Greige, and Burgundy colors. One thing to note is that the actual colors are WAY darker and more saturated than they appear in the example photos: brown is more of a dark brown, greige is near-black, and burgundy is very dark reddish pink (not brown at all!) Nevertheless, they are amazing. I have pretty sensitive eyes that tear up with cheap eyeliners, but these don't hurt me at all. They dry quickly and do not budge, smear, crack, or disappear even with all-day wear or when sweating. I would say these liners are even better than Stila's liquid liner and Kat von D tattoo liner in lasting power, except Love Liner is not as hard to remove as those two. The applicator also has a great shape for getting the perfect sharp wing, and doesn't separate or break apart like other liquid liners.

All sponges collect bacteria.<br /><br />Now on to the product review, this showed up really fast with prime and comes with two cases, one to carry a single one and the second to store the rest. Having them as two different colors helps a lot and makes it fun to change. They are soft but not too porous, the makeup will sink in a bit but not too much. These are better suited for applying makeup but not blending them together.

5.0,Great For Clean Up When The Area Is A Little Injured,"I normally use witch hazel for back door clean up. It helps sooth tissues & reduces uncomfortable problems. When clean up takes overly long due to pasty movements, the delicate tissue can get tiny tears that sting like nobodies business when cleaning up with witch hazel. This is where this cleansing lotion shines.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is weird putting lotion in that particular location, but it does make pasty clean up more comfortable.<br /><br />To assist healing & other minor back door problems, I recommend finishing up with WholeNest Less Than A Day - Hemorrhoid Relief Essential Oil Serum ( https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7LYFBDR ). I was skeptical, but it does really work.<br /><br />Regarding my Lady Garden, I haven't used this product for cleaning my Lady Garden.

4.0,Nice Brush | Similar To We Love Doodles & Chris Christensen | Cats Love It | Easily Removes Hair,"If I didn't already own & love my ""We Love Doodles"" brand of big slicker brush, I would have rated this brush at a full 5 stars. Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />🐱For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />🐰I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />🐰Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />🐇Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />🐇I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GU7NKWW<br /><br />Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure. So far I like all three.<br /><br />Chris Christensen: Made in Germany $75.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product//B00KAJTPZ2<br /><br />We Love Doodles: Made in USA $29.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09G981NXV<br /><br />Rita's: Made in China $36.99","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719WrxKYrkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719WrxKYrkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719WrxKYrkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Aj2Qy2npL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Aj2Qy2npL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Aj2Qy2npL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qJGSEri6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qJGSEri6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qJGSEri6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09NJDTJQK,B0BTTRRH98,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1656002296946,1,False
4.0,"Attractive Comb, Works On My Long & Short Haired Cats (Long sparse teeth comb)","I ordered the "" Long sparse teeth comb"" with my long haired cat in mind. I was worried the teeth would be too far apart, they're not. What is surprising is that this even works on my short haired cats. It pulls out loose fur just fine & my cats enjoy the way it feels. It does pull my long haired cats fur. She doesn't put up a fuss. Just purrs, cries at me if it hurts & continues to purr & reaches for me when I stop.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is attractive & looks nice left out on my coffee table. The downside is that the handle is very thin & is pretty short. I have very small fine boned hands (I'm a wee Irish lass) & need to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have large hands, I'm not sure this will work. Also, because it's not ergonomic it's really only good for short periods of use esp. if you have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I like the comb even though the quality could be better. A wider, longer more comfortable handle made with a stronger wood would have been pawsome. But for a casual grab to comb a visiting fur baby while I'm on the couch - it's purrfect!<br /><br />Made in China.",[],B09QHMJFDB,B0B5X48DZR,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1650219651737,0,False

3.0,"Heavy, Greasy, Doesn't Absorb - Will Retry In The Winter","I was fully prepared to fall in love with this USDA Certified Organic eye cream. I never use conventional products & am always thrilled to find new organic products. Sadly, as of right now (summer), this cream is no good to me. I am hoping that it will serve me better in the winter.<br /><br />It is very heavy, greasy, & sticky and it doesn't absorb. It just sits on my skin. My hair & pillow stick to it. I only use a teeny dab, I'm talking teeny tiny, & it is way more than enough to put around both of my sensitive middle aged eyes. This 2 oz. pot will last forever (or at least until it goes bad).<br /><br />I am a full time eco farmer who lives in a historic late 1700's log cabin. I don't have air conditioning. This means that where I live in the summer the humidity is very very high & it is very hot. This also means that in the winter, my air is very very very dry because I heat my home solely with a wood stove.<br /><br />I am telling you this because I am hoping that this eye cream will serve me well in the winter when my skin is screaming for hydration. Right now though with humidity & heat is high as it is, this stuff is total overkill. It just feels gross. I put this in the refrigerator in hopes that it will keep long enough for me to try it come winter. Normally, I'd wait to review, but I have reviewer time requirements, so here I am.

4.0,Need To Be Packaged Better 🤬 Look So Flippin' Cute On My Angora Bunnies 🥰,"I ordered these to put in my English Angora rabbits (from Running Bug Farm) wool after grooming. The clips work fine on my junior bunnies, but on my adult bunnies, they are not able to catch all of the bunnies bangs to get the wool out of their eyes. After some humorous trial & error I found that these work beautifully as a side clip on my adult bunnies. 🦋 A reviewer stated they held a lot of hair; they don't. I'm sure they are fine for kids as advertised, but not a lot of adult hair (or bunny wool) as was implied in the review.<br /><br />The clip part feels very strong, like it is made of metal. You pinch one end & it opens up so you can slide it into the hair, then let go. Really simple to use.<br /><br />I docked a star because of the packaging 🤬 These came in the cello bag pictured. This means they slid all around & bunched on each other causing 3 of the 12 to become permanently disfigured. I have been trying to get the wings corrected, but they just want to stay like they are.

3.0,"Unscented, Seems Decent, Not 100% Sure About Ingredients","I looked up the ingredients for this product at the Environmental Working Groups (EWG) Skin Deep data base & the following ingredients either rated as not green or I couldn't find them (0=green or safe, 10=red or dangerous):<br /><br />CYCLOPENTASILOXANE (3) - Persistent, bioaccumulative in wildlife, classified as expected to be toxic or harmful, uterine tumors in female rats, increased anogenital distance observed in rats at a moderate dose, moderate dose in rate suggested dopamine D2-receptor behavior on pituitary cells, suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative.<br />POLYSORBATE-60 (3)<br />DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br />ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br /><br />I looked up DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE on DuckDuckGo & I guess it's a new skin ingredient. It might be why it & ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN are not on EWG as they haven't been evaluated for safety. I really don't know though, it's just speculation on my part. As for safety, who knows? I rely on EWG to let me know. This is frustrating.<br /><br />I've used this several evenings as a night cream & I like it, but I don't love it. I heat my home exclusively with a wood stove. Even running humidifiers & essential oil diffusers 24/7, the air is painfully dry. So far this cream seems pretty good on my middle aged skin. The funny thing is, out of all the various brands I've tried on my face, a little known handmade brand has by far served me best. It's a brand called Eruzile or Progress in Health. They have two names. I don't know why. It's really annoying. They are on Etsy & last I checked, have their own website but for some foolish reason, it seems to be more expensive to shop at their website. And to be clear, I am not affiliated with them, I'm just a long time customer. Another brand I like but it is ridiculously expensive, so I hardly ever buy it is Juice Beauty Stem Cellular. You can get it right here on amazon.<br /><br />Okay, back to this brand. It is a light/thin feeling cream. Not greasy. It seems to absorb well. My skin does feel a tiny bit tight when I get up in the morning. I find a few spritz with rose water helps. This is packaged in a glass pot that you use your fingers to apply. A little plastic in the lid, so not Zero Waste, but not bad. It is not scented. It does have a smell as is normal because the ingredients will have their own smell to them, but when applying I don't notice the smell, so calling it unscented or fragrance free is more than reasonable. I only notice its smell if I'm practically sticking my nose in the pot & inhaling deeply.<br /><br />For me, this isn't moisturizing enough for the dead of winter, but for spring & fall I expect it will serve me fine.<br /><br />Overall, I would have rated this higher if not for the ingredient concerns.",[],B07W1WJZFG,B07W1WJZFG,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1612028329379,0,False
4.0,"Pretty Set, One Brush Frayed After First Use, The Rest Are Holding Up Well","I ordered this in the #6 set to use for watercolors. I know these are nail brushes, but I have found some nail brush products to not only be prettier in the hand, but also to last longer than standard watercolor brushes so I will order brushes like this on occasion.<br /><br />This set has it's pros & cons. The blue colored brush has a very disappointing brush head. After only one use the bristles started to fray.  The amber colored detail brush works great with no issues, same with the pink colored blunt brush. None of the heads are particularly large. The light blue is nice for little details.<br /><br />Knowing that watercolor is much more gentle to use, the fact that one of these brushes frays makes me wonder how well they will hold up to much more rough chemical nail use. Something you might want to keep in mind when considering your brush options.<br /><br />The overall look of the brushes is very nice.

It works.<br /><br />I hang these to dry on a copper rod that is just small enough to accommodate the little hanging loop that these have on them. This then hangs in front of a window which gets a lot of sun. It's a great way to get them to dry & to help fight bacteria.<br /><br />I hope they are 100% natural. I read in one of the questions that it has a foam core. I'm not too sure what to think of that. Really, with all the Chinglish & poor spelling, what should one think aside from, ""Oh, it's yet another made in China item being sold on amazon."" For the record, these loofah's will not ""remove horniness"" OMG, they really need to get someone to clean up their listings LOL!<br /><br />Overall, I'm really surprised by the quality & the size of these esp. after the lack of quality control in the listing. When you order stuff online, you never know what you're going to get. Time will tell how long they hold up for. I expect/hope they last a long time.",[],B08B5FJMHM,B08B5FJMHM,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1598564182499,0,False
5.0,Beautiful Upgrade for DIY from Polluting Plastic Bottles,"This is the second set of spray bottles of this type that I have ordered. Each set has been from a different brand/seller. They both perform exactly the same. I use them to make my own household cleaners, room sprays, toilet sprays, etc. I'm not a fan of our cultures plastic addiction & try to reduce my impact on the planet when I can. Running my own eco family farm full time helps considerably ;)<br /><br />I like everything about these bottles except for the same exact thing I don't like about my other set of bottles, the spray head rotates easily. It doesn't unscrew, that's not what I'm talking about. It's the spray head itself. I think if the bottle wasn't so heavy this wouldn't be an issue, but when spraying downward, the bottle will move due to the weight. If I hold the bottle with one hand, while spraying with the other, all is well.<br /><br />A possible solution to this might be to purchase these 16 oz amber glass bottles separately, then purchase a separate pack of very highly rated, top quality spray nozzles & a sheet of labels to see if that helps. Perhaps these sets are being sold with lower quality spray nozzles. I really cannot say. I currently don't have a need to order a bunch of bottles in this size & enjoy the convenience of having a ready made kit of 2, so for now, I'm happy enough with what I have.",[],B089CSF11Y,B089CSF11Y,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1598199782505,0,False
4.0,Nice Bamboo Brush but Bass Brush Is Better,"I like everything about this brush except for the handle which is much too short in my very petite hands. I cannot even imagine someone with average or large hands trying to hold onto this. Perhaps the issue is that I have very long, nearly to my butt straight hair, but I somehow doubt it. While this is a nice brush, Bass Brush is still the winner (link: https://amzn.to/2Y72DVJ)<br />The comb that comes with this is plastic. Not my thing at all. I wont be keeping it.<br />I'm keeping this brush in my vehicle, using my Bass in my home where my hair is brushed most often.<br />Overall, would have been a great brush if the handle was longer.",[],B08BY9P4HR,B08BY9P4HR,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1597761631849,0,False
2.0,Very Pretty Victorian BUT Need To Off Gas - Wont Order Again,"These are so pretty & very nicely made. The big problem is the horrible toxic chemical odor. These need to off gas outdoors for at least a week. If the weather holds, even longer is better. I let them sit in my hay barn for 2 weeks before using them. They hold my very long straight hair well & do not tangle. They are even packaged in a tidy little round plastic case with a screw top lid. There are 2 of each of five different subtle & soft colors. The smell though, OMG, for that, I wouldn't order these again.",[],B081D2R47W,B081D2R47W,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1597622537174,0,False

Obviously the brushes wont last as long, but right now, I'm not using them, LOL! I just wanted them, because you know, Harry Potter & therefore I had to have them.

5.0,Great For Men's Blends,"Cajeput Essential Oil (EO) is great in blends for men. My men's milk shaving soap is one of my best sellers at the farmers market.<br /><br />I've been using EO's for well over a decade. I use them in my own skin care products such as lip balms & creams plus my own milk soaps, bathroom sprays, fungal salves, & even blends for treating my farm animals. I never use toxic fragrance oils or perfumes. When I switched to an organic natural lifestyle, my health improved dramatically. I highly recommend essential oils over the toxic man made crapola.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.",[],B07WS2XQQM,B07WS2XQQM,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1595289695296,0,False
5.0,They Work Great,"These perform very well. I use them to make my own essential oil (EO) bug sprays, after sun sprays, room refreshers, etc. They are small, spray well & don't leak.<br /><br />The small size is great for portability. I take one of my bug spray formulas outside with me for while I work on my farm. Because I only use EO's the effectiveness wears off much faster than synthetic products. I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a slow processes but it keeps me from accidentally over filling the bottles. The tube that goes into the bottle is plenty long. It actually curls up in a C on the very bottom of the bottle. You can cut it if you want, but I leave it as is, I think they function better with the long tube. The stickers are a bit of a joke. I can't really fit ""Bug Spray"" on one tiny label. I'd have to write ""BS"" so I write ""Bug"" instead or ""Sun"" for example. It just barely fits.<br /><br />Overall, great little spray bottles that suit my farm girl needs.",[],B0876L7BWM,B0876L7BWM,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1594063246762,0,False
5.0,Great For Guests,"I ordered these for when I have guests on my eco farm. I'm not a fan of plastic toothbrushes & have been using bamboo toothbrushes for many years now.

5.0,Eco Farm Girl Approved,"This is a really nice tinted moisturizer. I run my own eco farm full time & need a lot of sun protection. I always wear a wide brimmed Sloggers brand hat along with a natural tinted moisturizer with SPF.<br /><br />Lesentia with a SPF of 31, provides natural looking coverage & helps to keep my skin tone more even looking. It adds a nice warm touch of color that is perfect for summer wear. It performs exactly as described. It does leave a shine, so I touch it up with Organic Wear pressed powder. There are no weird ingredients or fragrances.<br /><br />Another natural tinted moisturizer I like is by Organic Wear. Organic Wear provides a very thin, light coverage that requires a little bit of pressed powder to tone down the shine.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I decided to try this. I hope they decide to offer other coverage options besides medium. I'd like to get it in a lighter version for winter use.",[],B0855L611L,B0855L611L,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1593730289984,0,False
5.0,Beautiful - Using It In Promotional Photos,"I run my own eco farm full time. I ordered this because I thought it would work really great in some photo props & it does. The ""leather"" sections are synthetic but still look good. The beads are wooden. There are two dyed green pheasant feathers & some really excellent quality rooster saddle feathers. The two silver beads that you use to adjust the size of the headpiece are plastic. The dream catcher section feels like cotton, it is a pretty blue color that compliments the peacock feather perfectly.<br /><br />It's very earthy & very natural, just what this dirt loving tree hugger farm girl loves.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased.",[],B08532CNY7,B08532CNY7,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1592682389378,0,False
4.0,Very Nice But Not As Wide As I'd Expected,"I ordered these because the similar hair bands I bought from Walmart were pretty well worn. These appeared to function pretty much the same way, so I went ahead & ordered them. While I do like them & they will work for my purposes, they are not as wide as they appear in the product photos (my Walmart ones are double the width). I took off a star for that & only that. Otherwise they are great. I love the variety of prints, they are comfortable, & look good.<br />If it helps, I have long straight hair that goes past my bra line. I don't have bangs. I work outdoors everyday for my full time job which is running my eco family farm. Keeping my hair out of the way is a necessity, but I also want to feel as pretty as possible in a very dirty job.",[],B0885W8GCL,B0885W8GCL,AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,1592411848527,0,False

2.0,Save your Money,I am really big on Organic & safe products.  I was very excited about this lip amplifier having given up on them when I discovered how toxic they were.  Sadly this product turned out to be a big disappointment & I will not purchase again.<br /><br />The only thing to like about this product is it's good safety rating in the EWG Cosmetics Database & it provides a nice shine.  That's where it ends.<br /><br />It smells unpleasant.  It is very very watery & thin.  It says to apply generously.  If you try to do that it will be all over your face.  It does not last long & it is not moisturizing.  It does not plump the lips(I have yet to find a product that does) & it is not the best tasting.<br /><br />Save your money.

3.0,1/4 and 3/4,"I was so excited to get these.  I opened the bag, counted them to make sure there were 30.  I also separated them from what I would use and what I probably won't and while doing that, I found that roughly 3/4 of them are in good shape and the other 1/4 are not cut deep enough to get a mold piece.  (And yes, the ones that don't look cut well, I tried them out to make sure they just weren't suppose to be cut deep enough.  Well, those ARE suppose to be cut deeper than they are.)  Because of this I don't think they're really worth the price of $15.  It's a shame the seller doesn't make sure their product is top notch.  The designs are cute, the material is easy to release the mold designs and vey easy to clean.  Therefore, if not for the ones that aren't cut well, this would be well worth the price.<br /><br />Because of the positive things I mentioned, I gave this review 3 stars.

4.0,"Not ideal for very pale skin, but usable","For the record, I am a longtime Physicians Formula wearer, and their products can be hit or miss. I am not being paid to leave a review, or representing anyone but myself here. This is the first time I tried PF's countouring powder, and I've used it for about three seasons. I like it. I don't love it.<br /><br />I have very pale skin with pink undertones that is uber-sensitive and I have to be very careful about sun exposure. Anything can make me break out in hives or eczema, at any time, even if I used it daily for years. Thankfully, PF products have never done that to me, in almost a decade.<br /><br />As for this product, the shades are where I take some issue. They worked best for my tone in summer, but now, in winter -- I'm shopping for a different product.<br /><br />* The dark shade is really mahogany-like, so I have to blend, blend, blend in daylight or risk looking like I smeared mud on my face. It's good for shading jawline and cheekbones with a light touch at temples if you need it. Beware, though. If you are very pale, you want a very light touch with this one.<br /><br />*The medium shade is very subtle and helps blend and soften the dark. It also works well as a matte bronzer, around sides of the nose, and wherever you need just a little definition. This is the best shade of the bunch, honestly. At least for my skin tone.<br /><br />* The light shade is, frankly, worthless to me. It gives my skin a pasty, chalky look and looks heavy. Yuck. I occasionally use it in tiny spots as a concealer, but as a contour powder, it just looks like I put on way too much setting powder or something. Instead, I use my lightest shade of matte eyeshadow (also a PF product) and a higher-end illuminator for highlighting. Those results are beautiful, frankly, even on my 38 year old skin.<br /><br />All in all, PF's contour colors are suitable for pale skin, but may be better on other slightly darker or warmer skin tones, or on summer tanned skin.",[],B01N9LC44Q,B09Q3X5YWR,AEWX7O6MFJHZBAJGD53YKT26N3XQ,1543530726276,10,True

I can sanitize them better than any other rests I've used. The problems I've had with most of the gel neck rests, is they are only good until they get wet, then they slip off. I've tried the gel rests with the built in suction cups before. They are better than the ones without, but they eventually give way when wet as well. The major pro with this item is the suction cups are made of material that are not gel. They adhere terrifically. They are built around the gel and attached that way. I'm assuming one would want to keep that area dry in between uses so it doesn't eventually break down there.<br />The only problem I have is the single cup does not reach to the outside under the sink. Not sure if my sink has too thick of a rest? Either way, it is not made for universal use. Nevertheless, it still stays on, the single one just stays un attached. It does get caught on the chair sometimes if I am not careful when I bring the client up from the bowl.

5.0,"You can stop looking--THIS is ""The One""!!!!","This Eyelash Curler is the BOMB!  I'm over 40 and have long eyelashes enhanced by several years of using Latisse.  The only issue is, while my lashes ARE long, they are ""Unruly"".  They stick out in multiple directions and if I don't use a curler, they look horrible.  Over three years ago I purchased a Shu Uemura online from their site.  I was happy with it and it performed well, but the pads wore out and when I went online to purchase another one, I was disappointed to see that not only were they purchased by L'Oreal, they were completely out of stock on eyelash curlers on their own website!  The internet is FLOODED with counterfeit Shu Uemuras and frankly I didn't want that either.  So I went in search of an alternative.<br /><br />I purchased another high rated curler, the Billy B Eyelash curler online hoping that it would do the trick.  The Billy B one is ""different"" from the Uemura--it has a more rounded shape and I was hoping it would do a fabulous job.  Unfortunately I found that I had a harder time getting the rounded Billy B up next to my eyelash base, and inevitably it would miss my corner lashes entirely.  I'm sure the Billy B works well for people with smaller, more rounded eyes, and in all honesty the pads on it were great.  It just wasn't the right fit for me.<br /><br />So again I went searching and that's when I stumbled across the Bella & Bear.  This thing is awesome and with a single coat of mascara for work, my eyelashes look a mile long and very well separated.  I can't say enough good things about how easy this was to put up against my eyeline and get a good curl.  The handle fits my hand well and the spring loaded mechanism on this means you don't have to press all that hard to achieve a good curl.  It's flatter and not as rounded as the Billy B, so if your eyes are longer and flatter, this one should be able to easy grab from corner to corner without missing any lashes.  In fact, when I lined up my curlers side by side, you can see the shape of this one is more like the Uemura than the Billy B.<br /><br />The curler arrives packaged in a box, so you won't have to worry about it being broken in shipment.<br /><br />In all, I'm so happy with this eyelash curler that I will never go back to another brand.  So long as this one never gets broken I should be in business for a very long time.  I've already recommended it to a friend to use on her daughter's long eyelashes during dance recitals.  My search for the perfect curler is over!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515oSJrWuPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515oSJrWuPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515oSJrWuPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qnTEO6Y8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qnTEO6Y8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qnTEO6Y8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00JNI1DZQ,B00JNI1DZQ,AGGOR633N6ZQBUIKY6A5BY6LRPBQ,1404998299000,71,False

4.0,Good replacement for the extinct Bullfrog Surfer Formula,"I was a long-time user of Bullfrog's Surfer Formula.

None to be found, but I saw a reference to Doc Martin's Nextgen. Hmm.<br /><br />I decided to buy it. The product arrived. My first reaction was a little skeptical: 2 ounces isn't much!<br /><br />I gave it a try the next day on a hot, sunny day. A little bit goes a LONG way, so 2 ounces should last a while. It is very easy to apply, and even has a pleasant scent. I was out in the sun 5 hours with one application, and didn't have any burn. It didn't run until I got a surprise face bath, and then I had some run-off in my eyes. But I haven't had any eye run-off otherwise, even on long, hot, sweaty, muggy days.<br /><br />Doc Martin's Nextgen is a good substitute for the late Bullfrog Surfer Formula: it's easy to apply, it works for hours and hours, it stays put, but it's easy to remove when you want to remove it.

4.0,Adult acne sufferer is super pleased!!!,"The active ingredient in this set is the Benzoyl Peroxide at 4.25%. Which, if I am not mistaken is a pretty good amount. The packaging on this product says &quot;Step 2&quot; treatment. I am not entirely sure what that means unless it means there is a clearer to use first? I have also used the the cleanser made by this company and it really helps get rid of oiliness. I was super happy with that product so it seemed logic for me to jump all over this spot treatment product when I was provided the opportunity to purchase it at a discount in exchange for my honest review. So, I use the cleanser morning and night, pat dry and then apply this spot treatment to the breakout areas (usually my chin) and the fast acting treatment dries out the acne. I was able to tell a marked difference in how the acne dried out after the very first night. Also, it did not appear to dry out the skin around the breakout like some other harsher products have. As a longtime sufferer of adult acne, I think I have finally found a one, two punch to help knock out my acne problems once and for all!",[],B00MXQ918Q,B00MXQ918Q,AE5X4CYG3KEFQFBVN24H6YWTWDLQ,1457799570000,4,False

It won't get your hair as straight as flat-ironing, but this is better in a way, it just gently relaxes frizz and curls for a shiny, slightly wavy look, and it not as harsh on the hair.

5.0,99.9% Natural Eye Cream that works great!,"Being as close to “all natural” is a requirement for all my skin care products. Over the years I’ve experienced the good, the bad and the awful when purchasing skin care products.  I’m happy to report that Jillaroo Luxury Natural Eye Cream by Y Not Natural is a GREAT product. It is a nourishing eye cream containing certified organic avocado oil, shea butter, vitamins, minerals and amino acids and retinol. I posted a photo with the full ingredient list.<br /><br />The Jillaroo Eye Cream spreads easily and quickly absorbs into the skin. I’ve been applying the cream to my eyelids and below the eyes. It does not leave the eye area feeling or looking greasy. It has no detectable fragrance and it also does not sting my eyes. I let the Jillaroo Eye Cream absorb for about 2-3 minutes before applying any additional cosmetics to my eye area (mascara, eye line, etc.).  Only a very small amount of the Jillaroo Eye Cream is needed and I anticipate the bottle will at least two months or more.<br /><br />I’ve been using the Jillaroo Eye Cream for 5 days, twice a day (morning & evening) to give the product a good test. I’m really happy with the results. It definitely helps smooth away the fine lines around my eyes. I’m seeing small improvements to my eye area. I’m planning on repurchasing this product when the bottle starts getting low.<br /><br />The bottle is contains 15 grams of eye cream (about ½ an ounce). The 3.5 inch bottle is also a great size for traveling. The eye cream comes with a snap in place clear travel cap.<br /><br />Y-Not Natural is a Western Australian owned and operated family company. The Jillaroo Luxury, Natural Eye Cream is just one of many products they make. The company has a full line of high quality natural products. I’m hoping more Y-Not Natural products become available on Amazon.<br /><br />On a final note - I receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I am not affiliated with the manufacturer or seller of the product. I do not receive any type of compensation for positive or negative reviews.  I only purchase items I truly want to use for myself.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fyy3EIJIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fyy3EIJIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Fyy3EIJIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hoGDEx8zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hoGDEx8zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hoGDEx8zL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lhI3VkZGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lhI3VkZGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lhI3VkZGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00O4D92ZI,B00O4D92ZI,AEHIDXDI2JOONWP44NA4II2FCR5A,1466346803000,3,False

3.0,"Meh as a primer but great for added hydration for sensitive, dry skin; OK for Normal, NOT FOR OILY","I have sensitive, combination skin. My forehead is dry, my cheeks are normal, and my nose and chin are oily. Talk about a headache... Over the years, I've been searching high and low for a &#34;one size fits all&#34; primer that can smooth out any dry patches, keep my natural oils at bay, and of course, be grippy so that my makeup can actually be long lasting! Unfortunately, I've yet to find one that can cater towards all of my skin's needs...this primer included.<br />As a primer, the product is honestly so-so. A primer, to me, needs to provide a great base for your makeup but also let your makeup be long lasting. This primer is great for sensitive, dry skin as a BASE. First off, it has the loveliest of scents and a very lightweight texture that seems to make your skin feel very fresh and bouncy. It smooths over dry patches and seems to fill it in to the point that your texture is nice and smooth. On it's own, it provides a beautiful layer of hydration and glow.<br />Though the hydration is nice for normal skin, I don't find it good as a primer as it can make you feel borderline oily, and that's something that I simply don't like.<br />For oily skin, BEWARE! This will make you look as if you have spent the day running a marathon as it has the ability to pull out all of your natural oils, even if you do set your makeup with powder!",[],B06XFMZMS7,B06XFMZMS7,AEFYCLLJL62P6MJNBZH73BSEUQRA,1519955876232,3,False

4.0,i wish i knew how to use ALL the brushes...,"I was so excited to receive this set.  I already had a brush set from Mary Kay, that I love; but, I it only has 5 brushes.<br />Since I like to contour and highlight (subtly), I mostly needed brushes for this.<br />Researching sets produced a huge price range.  One could spend upwards of $70.00, with comparable brush sets.  Yikes!!  This set is much more affordable.  The brush handles are solid and bristles are firmly attached.  Some brushes are softer than others.<br /><br />So, if they are quality brushes and the price is reasonable, why am I only rating them 4 stars?  I had no clue what each brush was for, and the internet wasn't very helpful:(<br />If the brushes had been labeled, or there had been an insert explaining the function/functions of each brush--it would have received 5 stars.  Add pictures/diagrams for tips on use, even better.  I would be willing to pay a little extra for an easy to clean roll-up case for the brushes.  A girl needs to keep her brushes clean.  That is a feature, I believe many look for.  I travel a lot, so my roll up bag (for my other set) is essential.<br />As it is, Cosmopolitan magazine's website has an article on how to use different makeup brushes.  It was helpful for a few of the brushes, which I now use everyday.<br /><br />What I love:<br />*The sponges are fabulous for applying foundation and blending after you contour/highlight.<br />*The large, angled brush is great for applying blush, so it looks more natural.<br />*The large, pointed brush does a nice job, when adding bronzer to contour.<br />*The large, round brush is what I rely on for swirling on powder.<br />*The small, pointed brush is phenomenal at applying color at applying contour eye shadow.<br />* I use the small, tall bristled, rounded brush to blend the areas of shadow on my eyes that need softening.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />*Obviously, not knowing what each brush is for.<br />*The eyeshadow? brushes use too much product and application is sparse.  I believe it's because the bristles are stiffer than what I usually use.<br />*No case to keep them clean, which leads me to look for alternative solutions.  Leaving them out in the air, exposed, is a bad idea.  Think of the germs in the air, especially if you keep them on the bathroom sink.  Eww!  Bacteria grows quickly and can cause infections, such as pink eye.<br />User Tip: I use baby shampoo to wash my brushes.

Other waterproof eyeliners either are so dry that they don’t go on easily or it’s going to smear or come off before I want it to, especially since I have oily skin. But this actually stays on for the longest time! It doesn’t come off until you use warm water or make up remover, and then it comes off very fast without a problem. It might not be waterproof in the sense of going swimming or taking a shower and expecting it to stay on, but if you are like me and use waterproof eyeliner because other eyeliners tend to smear or fade by the end of the day then you will love this.<br />By the way, I have several Canmake cosmetics now and the ones I have so far are just as good as department store/high end cosmetics but cost much less.",[],B06WVBPFPF,B06WVBPFPF,AFQNGFDB3PD4EHNLFJM2HWXUPM5Q,1566678461824,3,True

2.0,Won’t buy again!,"I do not recommend this kind of hair for passion twist. Freetress is way more softer and this is rough and way more kinky.

It’s difficult to find Freetress Water Wave because it’s that good!. I thought this was going to be something like it but NOT!. I wish I would’ve looked at the 1-2 star reviews before I purchased this hair because those reviews holds truth to this hair. When I buy Freetress water wave people can’t believe it’s crochet hair because of its quality. This hair, I can definitely tell. This hair is not for Passion Twist the title is misleading you because passion twist is the thing right now so they want sales. I give this hair a 2 star because I love the length of the hair.

I used white at the base color on all my test nails, except for the gold nail that uses a nude base color.  These powders are super easy to use, a tiny amount goes a long ways, and the colors are just lovely.  A few tricks I discovered:  less powder is better than more...if you use to much it get's clumpy and can't be easily fixed.  Apply a base coat, a colored base color, AND a top coat before adding the chrome...this creates a wonderfully smooth and durable surface for the powder.

5.0,"Great, versatile builder’s gel!","I was concerned this builder gel would be difficult to work with based only on how runny it looks in the product pix.  In real life it looks runny and sticky, but is surprisingly easy to work with.  After applying a long bead of the gel with the included brush, I pushed the gel to my desired shape, and then let it self level to smooth itself out.  On both thick and thin layers very little effort was required on my part.  In fact, if I tried to get the shape perfect with the brush, the gel got stickier and messier, so I quickly learned to let the gel smooth itself out.  Tip: once you get your shape all smoothed out, turn your nail upside down and let gravity create a natural apex before popping it under the lamp. So far I’ve only used the clear gel.  I created on extension (not shown), attached rhinestones to several pride nails, and fully encapsulated a fully covered rhinestone nail.  1 thick layer of this hard gel and a have encased rhinestones that fully cured in just over 2 minutes!  I also plan to use this for simple overlays when my nail need additional support.  The sticker nail forms work well, the slip solution is good for clean up work (not shaping the gel), and the brush/spatula tool work as expected.

3.0,"Mostly good results, wasteful packaging...","I had mixed results with these 3 products.  The eye patches are gel patches and not meant to be wet with serum - the serum is released by the gel when it's in contact with skin.  The patches easily stayed in place, but resulted in no visible improvements, and left my undereye area feeling a little dehydrated.  The lip patch is also a gel patch.  It was odd to wear, but it stayed on while I moved around and almost seemed to form a suction seal around my mouth after 10 minutes.  I liked this patch - it left my lips smooth and soft for a day and a half...nice!  The foot booties are for moisturizing only...these are NOT exfoliating booties that take days to work and lead to skin peeling.  They were easy to use and comfortable to wear.  I wore them for 30 minutes and was quite pleased with how soft my feet still felt after 2 days.  My only issue was that after removing the booties I had to spend a good amount of time massaging in the lotion left on my feet...seriously, even after trying to dry them with a towel my feet felt greasy.  Be sure to allow time for the product to absorb afterwards and don't plan to run out the door like I did.  For all of this, I would give the set 4 stars.  However, there's an EXCESSIVE amount of packaging.  The patches all have plastic protectors on both sides, are enclosed in plastic clam shells, and are sealed in the final package.

One of the main reasons I ordered this was because I expected a pleasant scent, so this was disappointing.  The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn’t fully dry or pull my skin, and it’s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don’t care for.  They’re aren’t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn’t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can’t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn’t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.

5.0,"Nice masks, nice results!","I’ve tried several different Karuna masks...they’re all good, but some are better than others.  This particular set is a great mix of masks designed to help with different needs, including hydrating, soothing and brightening.  The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They’re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they’re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there’s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it’s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I’ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.

4.0,"Super soft skin, but oh so messy to use!!","This coffee scrub smells divine while dry, and leaves my skin smelling ever so subtly like coffee and cinnamon.  Oddly, I don’t really notice the smell in the shower.  I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body.  Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don’t care for.  Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I’m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don’t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what’s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it’s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn’t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it’s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I’m constantly concerned it’s going to stain my floor grout.

5.0,My favorite Karuna mask!,"I’ve used various Karuna masks, but this is defiantly my favorite.  The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn’t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn’t overwhelming.  TIP:  I’ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn’t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.

1.0,"Great idea, but...no.","I had heard about these mask frames and was so excited to see them available on Amazon.  I was hoping they’d help keep my mask drier while at the gym.  Unfortunately, they’re simply too small for an adult face...I’m not even sure they’d work for a child.  The frame is surprisingly comfortable against the face, and it did indeed create a pocket/bubble around my nose and mouth.  However, the frames are so small, I literally can’t open my mouth to talk without my lower lip slipping uncomfortably out of the frame...and I have a pretty average sized face!  If you don’t talk to anyone while wearing a mask, this is a cool little find.  If you do talk, or just breathe heavily (like at the gym), this will never, ever work for you...not even close.

4.0,Comparable to the basic Waterpik portable with a few improvements and extras,"This unit is comparable to my very basic travel Waterpik flosser. In fact it has several features that the basic model lacks for around the same price. This unit has three speeds, whereas the entry level Waterpik only has one. The fastest speed is comparable with the one speed on my Waterpik, and it’s the only speed I need. This unit has a charge light (blinks until charged) while there is no such light on the comparably priced Waterpik. This device has about the same sized reservoir as the Waterpik, but because of the design, it’s on the bottom as opposed to along the sides of the unit, the result being that it makes it a lot bulkier, which is unfortunate in a travel water flosser. Unfortunately, there is no advantage to this design as like the Waterpik, it begins to stop pumping water as the tank gets lower, forcing the user to keep the unit vertical in order to get to the water at the very bottom of the reservoir, which can become quite awkward while trying to get around the teeth and gums. I’ve owned several of these, and to be fair, they all suffer from this same problem.<br /><br />One more thing: this unit comes with a nice case and a stash of attachments (which are usually found in home units and don’t generally come with portable units ,) none of which I have much use for, but I guess it’s good to know they’re there. It does include two of the standard water flosser adaptors, so two people can use it.<br /><br />The only thing that remains to be seen is how long this puppy will last. This is my 3rd travel water flosser. I’ll report back should something ontoward occur, or if it continues to work well.",[],B07JCYGJC3,B07JCYGJC3,AGNVHS4AY4B7UMI67FO3WLRTELPQ,1544427395230,0,False

5.0,Kojic Acid May Help Lighten The Skin,"I became interested in kojic acid because it has the ability to remove iron from the skin. Excess iron in the body is a cause of heart disease and cancer (in men, who often have excess iron, giving blood regularly reduces the risk of these two diseases). Some people (myself included) suspect that excess iron can also age the skin more quickly.<br /><br />Kojic acid is also known to lighten the skin to a degree, so can be useful to treat scars and excessive pigmentation. This is the main reason people use it.<br /><br />That being said, it won't work miracles with your skin in this area. It may have a minor effect, and did so on my skin. However, I believe it is a part of an overall healthy skin routine.<br /><br />This kojic acid cream seems good.

I was curious just because I figured if you absolutely wanted to take it orally, you could.<br /><br />My main issue with this is the dropper. It's a very inconvenient way to deliver cream. A lot of it gets stuck up in the dropper.<br /><br />Another slight drawback is that it does smell like hemp. A friend jokingly said my face smells like a fig newton after I apply it.

If you're expecting your hair to look like it does after you use your flat iron, it will not and you will be disappointed. It left a good amount of the natural body in my hair so that it looked like a natural straight.<br />The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the rubber that is used to line the outside of the brush, protecting your scalp and hands, is great--it does just that.

The (aqua) color is cute, the zippered compartments allow you to easily view what is inside while providing easy assess via the zippers and the soft outside conforms more easily to my packed luggage while still holding a large amount of items.

5.0,Tiny bottle - Great for Gua Sha massage,[[VIDEOID:9dead00b25249e454e9ac285069262fb]] To my surprise- This is a tiny bottle of Jasmine Vital Oil.

This particular oil I use for my gua sha routine every other night.<br /><br />It absorbs very well into the skin & the gua sha easily glides on my facial skin.

I had some product build up on my hair and scalp and didn't want to do a full shampoo. With this cowash, I made sure to thoroughly wet my hair doing some massaging to move the buildup. Then, I lathered with the cowash, massaged it in, and left it on for 15 minutes. During that time, I could easily finger comb my hair with no problem. After rinsing, my hair was very clean, soft, and easy to manage. My scalp felt clean as well. I only used a leave-in conditioner afterwards. When my hair dried, it was still soft.

It does seem to add a bit of volume to our hair.  We tried this on dry and wet hair and noticed more volume to dry hair (which makes sense because there less weight to dry hair).  I LOVE the colors and that it's padded.  The s-shaped design of the bristles are a new thing for me but it does seem to help with detangling - it doesn't pull to hard, very gentle.  The padding is not excessive but really helps with snarled hair.  I think this works BETTER than some of the detangle wet brushes you see in stores.<br /><br />The handle is a nice silicone grip, the bristles feel light weight but solid - not breakable.  Another plus - when brushing my daughters hair (she's 5) if I accidently snag her ear, she said it doesn't hurt as bad as the other brushes we've used before!  I don't brush hard but some of the other brushes I've used before have been so rough on her ear that she has cried.  :(  This one does not!  No more crying!!!

I couldn’t believe it and thought my immune system was compromised. (I haven’t had one since 5 years old, now 50)<br />I iced it when feeling the onset, took 4,000 mg of Lysine, put DSMO rose on it( never read anything about it concerning this but figured why not, I have it, no side effects besides tasting garlic in your mouth briefly)  popped zicam (zinc) tablets every hour, and did a dab of Abreva. The next day the fever blister disappeared almost. Half the size. I told my sister who couldn’t believe it either as she gets them 2x a year.<br />I would say to use this product (the rose cream first) if you are unfamiliar with DSMO before you graduate to liquid. Now that I know it can be used for anything besides pain, I’m all in.<br />I will say for pain, when used with other things in combination/conjunction  (Joint care by Redd. Remedies), MSM course organic flakes and DSMO, you don’t have to reach for prescription meds. You can find all on amazon.  I have all prescription meds under the sun for my condition. Pain meds, muscle relaxers, lidocaine patches..But I am firm believer prescription meds lead to other problems or diseases. Try natural first.  My concoction of the 3 natural works wonders.
