So I ordered it, thinking that I already know what the color is like so I didn't need to worry about seeing it in person first before buying it. So when the compact arrived, I was surprised to find that the color had changed a bit. Instead of being a neutral/natural pink, it definitely has become a light, cool-tone pink. Now, this really isn't a problem because it's just the right shade and tone that will work very well on my cool-toned complexion, but it ISN'T the B-Slap blush I remember from 6 or 8 years ago. And I feel a little disappointed. I really liked how that almost-but-not-quite warm/neutral pink looked on my complexion. I will still wear it; it's a lovely pink, but it isn't &#34;the old&#34; B-Slap that I remember.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Better than many other epilators for smooth skin", "text": "I've tried a couple of different types of epilators over the past 15-20 years.  While I was usually happy enough with the results, I rarely used them since it always seemed like you had to wait until the hair got long enough for the unit to grip the hair in order to yank it out.  And rarely did I really want the hair on my legs to reach that amount of stubble.  Not to mention the pain that is involved with epilators.  Yes, I am a weenie.<br /><br />This model of the Braun Silk Epil removes much shorter hair.  It claims to remove hair that is as short as a grain of sand (0.5mm).  I personally find it requires it to be a bit longer than that to grip; but it does do a much better job of reaching short hair than others I've tried.  It has a pivoting head which lets it work around all your body contours.  A light on the unit allows even the palest, finest hairs to be visible.<br /><br />In addition to hair removal, this epilator refines your skin.  A sonic massage system and high-density brush scrub away old skin cells.  This exfoliation helps to stimulate the regeneration of surface skin cells in order to create a smoother skin tone.  I do notice a bit of a smoother, more even skin tone on my legs now.  This sonic massage is my favorite part of the device...in part because I really don't like the tweezing part.<br /><br />This model can be used wet or dry and uses rechargeable batteries rather than a power cord.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I find that it still hurts...although not nearly as much as it used to.  With regular use, the hairs on my legs have become fewer.  Plus, the already pale fine hair is becoming even thinner and weaker.  Braun claims that it will keep your body free of hair for up to 4 weeks.  I usually find it to be somewhere in the 2 to 3 week range for me.  Still, that's nice for when you're going on vacation or heading off to the beach for a week or two.

My doctor finally just made this comment, and it is very true:  At a certain age women just have less moisture in their bodies (in this case it was my eyes).<br /><br />That phrase also applies to our skin, and of course the most visible is our face.  This moisturizer is for those of us that need that extra little boost, as we might have &#34;advanced&#34; skin.  Now in my late 40's I am noticing those fine lines, especially on my forehead, what I would call my furrowed brow lines.  Will this moisturizer erase these lines? No.  But it can help diminish appearance.<br /><br />An added benefit of this moisturizer is it also provides a moisture barrier to protect your skin from the elements.

Now we know better and with better products are able to protect our skin from the elements.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKG14OEE86CQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0SE52Q", "images": [], "asin": "B00U3CMZXA", "parent_asin": "B00U3CMZXA", "user_id": "AEWSXV6I6BVJQFNUV2EXHEWXRQXQ", "timestamp": 1447815240000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Not only is the hairline beautiful but the color is perfect, the weight is amazing and the length is just right ... not too long like many are. I'll cut the lacefront eventually but these pictures are literally how it looks just plopped on my head, with my own hair peeking out.

I heard it didn\u2019t really have much of a scent (I love my scented soaps) and that it was hard to lather.  As far as the scent goes, it didn\u2019t matter near as much as I thought it would. Honestly, with most soaps the scent fades rather quickly anyway. And it does have a scent. Just not a perfume scent. It\u2019s very pleasant. And it was super easy to lather. I had absolutely no issues. Truth be told, it lathered better than almost any soap I\u2019ve used.  What it\u2019s not is \u201cfoamy\u201d, and that\u2019s actually a good thing. As insane as this may sound, on the face it feels like wool. It has a close, cushioned feel to it. Some soaps I\u2019ve used either dry out on the face before I finish a pass or it slides off my face. Not this. If you prefer natural, perhaps old-fashioned soap this is for you.", "images": [], "asin": "B06XRZ6Q4Z", "parent_asin": "B06XRZ6Q4Z", "user_id": "AFAOODWSSWROX7QU6AU2ZWZPKCKQ", "timestamp": 1541577776555, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great for Smooth Skin", "text": "Cons:<br />I bought these because it would supposedly also help you save on soap by creating loads of lather. I do not notice that effect. In fact, I would say I notice less lather.  I do not use traditional soap, however, and instead use handmaid castile soap. So, instead I just lather up first, and then use this cloth, and it's not a huge deal.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and this cloth can be too abrasive if used with any pressure on some parts of my skin. So, lathering up and then using the cloth also helps me to only use this abrasive cloth where I need it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great for those little bumps.<br /><br />Fantastic at exfoliation for shaving, waxing, any hair removal, etc.<br /><br />Helps with ingrown hairs! But be careful not to press too hard when using it. Go over multiple times at a lighter pressure rather than pressing too hard, which can have the opposite effect and actually cause ingrown hairs.<br /><br />WONDERFUL at keeping my feet smooth!

I'd absolutely never use them on my face or neck.<br /><br />After the first use, I noticed an immediate improvement to my bumpy skin.

Literally the ears are made of one thin wire that shapes it and it's covered in cheap lace.<br />I could already tell right from out of the packaging that these pair of ears were cheap looking. They did not even make any effort of cutting the lace right. One ear has more lace material than the other and it's kind of bulging out. Plus the lace is already falling apart. There were a few pieces of lace that came off already and I literally just opened the packaging like 10 minutes ago.

The pink stays on really well even though I have to wear steel toed shoes at work every day.  Other (high end) brands have failed that test often. The pink color stays solid with that test long enough that my nails start growing out and I have to change out the polish for that reason.  The purple color must have a higher pigment load because it did chip slightly where my toe rubs against the box of my steel toed shoes. But that is still way better than other polishes. It even survives my regular beach trips.<br /><br />The polish has helped with the damage to my toe nails. The cracking I was getting is less. My family has an inherited condition that over the years causes the toe nails to thicken. The older generation has thicken so much that they have to use a rotary tool to trim their nails.  I gave a bottle of the clear to one of the men with the issue and he has seen an improvement as well. I can only hope that with the continued use my nails will never reach the level that theirs have.

I've now used it exclusively for over 3 years and purchase it in multi-packs for team events.<br /><br />I've spiked hair as long as 18-24 inches and, if you can find a creative way to sleep with your hair spiked so high, your style will last a few days, even if you're dancing in the wind.<br /><br />Tips for use: Brush or comb hair. Depending on the desired style, it's often helpful to part hair into segments for spikes and using coated hair ties to keep the segments apart.  Apply spray to clean, dry hair.  Spray  Got2b Glued liberally (your hair should feel wet) first to the roots in small segments and dry with a hair dryer on a cool setting to establish the &#34;base&#34; of your style. Use your hands to shape it as your dry. (For some of the longer hair, it can become a  four-hand task, so get some assistance from a friend.)

It was the third brace I ordered -- the first was not nearly strong enough, and the second sizing was off. I'm so glad I found this one: It's a superb brace -- fine, sturdy stays,plus hinges that let you adjust both flexion and extension. I initially thought that latter feature was something I wouldn't need, but it turns out to have made a huge difference during this first month of healing. (Needless to say, I could not have handled a sleeve-type brace -- the open front/wrap style was mandatory, and made my life so much easier.)  I've been wearing the brace 24/7 -- night as well as day --  for more than a month and it's been my saving grace.  Service has been superb, too: Before I ordered, I measured my thigh, knee and calf; I was on the cusp between sizes, and so ordered up. That seemed like a good idea at the time because it allowed me to wear the brace over my slacks, as well as under -- but after almost a month of continuous wear. the thigh (which was a little larger than I needed to begin with) seemed to have stretched out; I couldn't wrap the upper portion tightly enough and even with the straps cinched tightly, the brace slipped after an hour or two or wear. I wrote the seller and asked if there was a solution -- this brace was costly enough that I didn't want to have to pay out of pocket for a second one -- and they offered to send  me a smaller size. It arrived within a few days, accompanied by a label for free return of the first.  I couldn't have been more impressed or more grateful. I'd recommend this brace, and this seller, to anyone.", "images": [], "asin": "B013J4E6BW", "parent_asin": "B013J4E6BW", "user_id": "AEMO6QJJB252J43ZO375C34JPPOA", "timestamp": 1471888856000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect for avoiding messy manicures!", "text": "I do a lot of nail art that includes stamping, sponging and a bunch of other really messy designs. My problem is that when I do all of those things the polish gets all over my skin making clean up take a bit longer than I like. So I needed to find something that could help with that problem. In comes this liquid latex!<br /><br />I ordered one in the hopes that it would help with keeping the skin around my nails clean while I'm doing those messy manicures. I cleaned out an empty nail polish bottle and filled it up with this liquid latex. Then I used the brush from the nail polish bottle to apply the liquid latex to the skin around my nails. I gave it a few minutes to dry then did my manicure. Once done with the manicure I used a little nail polish remover on a brush to make sure none of the latex was attached to the polish on my nail (don't want to ruin the manicure by pulling the polish on my nail off with the latex). Then, using tweezers, I pulled the latex off of each finger. For the most part it came off easily leaving clean up much easier with less to clean.<br /><br />This was a lifesaver! I am very pleased with this liquid latex. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell, it's almost a fishy smell. It is very strong at first when applying. Once dried the smell does dissipate for the most part so it doesn't bother me that much.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Easily organizes those small round plates", "text": "This is a wonderful case for small round plates, I am very glad that I ordered it! Before I had gotten this case I just had been keeping my round plates in a little drawer that I made, so needless to say it wasn't at all organized and when I would close and open the drawer the plates would all shift making an even bigger mess. Now with the plates holder I can have all of them organized and easily viewable. It really does make it so much easier now. Now when I'm getting everything ready to do my nails I can pull out this plate holder and quickly flip through the pages and look to see which plate and design I want to use. So so much easier! I love that it has a zipper enclosure so keep all the plates safe from falling out.<br /><br />I do wish the slots were a tiny bit bigger so they could also fit the small square plates. Also, with my long nails it can sometimes be a little hard to pull the plates out of the slots on the pages. Those would be my only issues with it. I almost filled it up with plates I already have and I love stamping plates so chances are I will end up ordering another one when I've run out of room.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the seller or this product and am under no obligation to provide a positive review nor do I receive any sort of compensation one way or the other.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works great, a little hard to attach", "text": "This wonderful product allowed me to continue using my favorite T3 Featherweight blowdryer with my new Xtava Black Orchid diffuser!! I didn't have to buy a new blowdryer! I will admit that I measured the wrong thing when I ordered the SnozzlePro adapter (I measured the base of the concentrator nozzle that came with the blowdryer and not the actual blowdryer nozzle - oops!) My blowdryer is actually a little wider than the measurements given for the SnozzlePro. It was so close, I was determined to make it work! I was able to do it with a little manipulation and a slender tool to give just a little extra stretch to get the SnozzlePro over the end of the blowdryer nozzle (used a tool WITHOUT any sharp edges or points, nothing that could damage the SnozzlePro or the blowdryer). **I did this at my own risk - knowing that I could possibly damage the SnozzlePro or my blowdryer!!** Very gently, I was able to get the SnozzlePro onto my blowdryer. I made sure it was evenly attached all the way around before adding the Xtava Black Orchid diffuser. I attached the diffuser to the SnozzlePro AFTER I put the SnozzlePro on the blowdryer - the opposite of what the instructions advise you to do. (also note that before attaching the SnozzlePro to the blowdryer, I put the diffuser on the SnozzlePro a couple of times to make sure it fit properly and that I would be able to attach it without needing to use the other end of the adapter to make sure it was secure).  After getting everything in place, I'm happy to say that it's very secure and there's nothing that is loose or has any wiggle room whatsoever!! I'm never removing it!! It's there until the dryer kicks the bucket or something breaks! It's working beautifully! It holds very tightly and securely, it hasn't slipped or moved at all since I attached everything!! You can see in the pics how tightly it's holding. I love drying my hair with this diffuser! My hair looks amazing and dries faster than when I used to use a round brush! No more work drying with a round brush! Just using this diffuser and moving it to different sections of my hair, it's easier than ever to dry my hair! Thank you for making this product that allows us to use this wonderful diffuser on other brands of blowdryers! I will be recommending it to everyone who has curly hair!<br /><br />Update - the adapter and diffuser has come off a couple of times and it takes a little bit of work to get it back on because my blow dryer is a tiny bit bigger than the measurements but I can get it back on. I think it came off because I accidentally held it by the adapter or grabbed it by the diffuser. Definitely only hold it by the barrel of the blow dryer (like in my 3rd pic) or the handle for the blow dryer!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9EHluFOL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9EHluFOL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L9EHluFOL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nFPnM-JL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nFPnM-JL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715nFPnM-JL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WuNTsoNZL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WuNTsoNZL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WuNTsoNZL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07X8Z9W22", "parent_asin": "B07X8Z9W22", "user_id": "AHHRJIXM7X75XWK4KZUL6AAK3NNQ", "timestamp": 1635387169534, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Looks great, but not practical", "text": "This looks very nice when it's assembled and you use it to store your brushes. A word of caution when you assemble it, attach the rods to the bottom piece first, then when you attach the top piece, make sure that the holes line up before you attach the top screws. They don't all line up on every set of holes. I had to undo it and reattach it to get the top and bottom slots to line up correctly! Once I did, it works beautifully. It would be nice if the bottom holes were a little deeper to hold the bigger brushes better. A little tab to pull the protective plastic would be nice too, I was afraid of scratching it while I was trying to get the protective film off! Overall it's well worth the price and I'm glad I bought it. It holds my brushes and looks very nice. UPDATE: while this looks like a nice brush hokder. It's not very practical for everyday use. The slightest touch will move the brush out of its holder. The bottom holes don't hold the brushes securely. My brushes are constantly falling over and sliding into the holder.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Pretty natural looking", "text": "Finally, after over a year of having these, I actually tried them out! I\u2019ve never worn false lashes before and was hesitant to use them (obviously since I\u2019ve had them a year without using them - lol!). I\u2019ve seen so many false eyelashes that are so crazy over-the-top obviously fake looking. These are not that way at all. You get a generous supply of them (see photos) and they are reusable too. With the rate I\u2019m going, mine should last forever!<br />I don\u2019t have get up close vision so it was a little bit harder for me to apply them than it would be for someone who can see better. I used a magnifying makeup mirror though and did fine. The photos of the eyelash after it was applied was my first attempt ever to do this so it\u2019s definitely not perfect but it was much easier to apply than I expected it to be. I am sure my results will improve with practice. These are secured in place with magnetic eyeliner (I guess I am pretty ignorant about these things but I had never heard of that!). The eyeliner goes on smoothly; actually better than some liquid eyeliner that I\u2019ve used in the past. It\u2019s a little tricky to get them in the best spot. Like I said previously though, I think this will get much easier the more times I try them. It comes with tweezers to use but it was almost easier for me to apply them without using them. Once in place, I was amazed at how well they stayed in place!<br />They were easy to remove and the eyeliner did require makeup remover to get it off, but it also came off without a problem.<br />I didn\u2019t wear them long. I will have to get used to how they feel; it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, just different for me. I have very thin, light-colored eyelashes so I think I\u2019m really going to enjoy these!<br />(Excuse my bad photos too - no other makeup whatsoever on and first attempt so I look pretty awful - lol But I actually love the lashes!)", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FGJ93J-JL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FGJ93J-JL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FGJ93J-JL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K1i4GcccL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K1i4GcccL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61K1i4GcccL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iWLOiU15L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iWLOiU15L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iWLOiU15L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08Y13HMLC", "parent_asin": "B08Y13HMLC", "user_id": "AHSRXEAKIZWDKIKTZF2HOG6NF2CQ", "timestamp": 1667303432752, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

IT DOESN'T DO THAT!<br />Not sure why my last review was removed, but it IS 100% honest and accurate!  This product doesn't work AS PROMOTED!  I've got LONG hair that is long enough to sit on, keep it well cared for.  The video shows \"silky smooth & super shiny\" hair after using this product.  I've used the entire jar now (that's 4 treatments by the way for hair like mine) and though yes my hair IS soft (but it ALWAYS has been) its' over all look & condition has NOT changed at all!  I was hoping for the silky soft shiny hair shown in the video as I have very curly hair (not looking for STRAIGHT hair, just SMOOTH & SHINY) & it doesn't work!

There are 3 layers to this bag to keep your different items separated, such as shampoos, brushes, actual makeup. It also comes with an attached name tag like you use on suitcases. I will more than likely order another 1 or 2 of these for presents in the future for the women in my family, they are really great nice!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I'm a beginner at contouring. This kit was perfect for me.", "text": "I have a very fair skin tone - my foundation range is usually ivory, or light ivory, the lightest choices. I am no makeup guru, but am intrigued with all the contouring I see going on in social media and magazines. I wanted to know more, but needed a tutorial on how to do this for my face. I liked this set because it came with instructions on how to apply correctly for a contour effect.<br /><br />Each palette in this set is made up of a blush like material - there is no foundation or creamy application to it. Each shade is also matte, and does not include any pearly or sheen tint to it.  The directions state to apply your regular foundation FIRST, then use this contour kit, THEN follow up with your regular blush and bronzer.<br /><br />I really loved the brush that was included in the kit. It gave me much better contouring effects than any brush I have used from my makeup set before.  The brush is thick and flat.  Because this is a powder/blush application, this gave me noticeable contouring on my face, without being too dramatic like a foundation contour product might do that requires sponge blending. I was able to blend this powder in as much as I liked, which softened the contour look.  As I get more confident in my application, I won't need to blend it in as much, but will enjoy a little more drama in the application.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great product for someone like me to try out that is just getting started with contouring.  For a more advanced or skilled makeup artist, I'd assume you would want more dramatic effects than this powder supplies.<br /><br />Promotional discount offered for review purposes", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7173nmLJ43L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7173nmLJ43L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7173nmLJ43L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RUbl6DRLL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RUbl6DRLL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RUbl6DRLL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01IIJDUVK", "parent_asin": "B01IIJDUVK", "user_id": "AHQTJCGDVBSJIHSKDURERGFMUQQQ", "timestamp": 1472682283000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

I don't know if that was true, but the condition of my item is irrelevant to the review. This is a great light. It replaces both my 24w UV bulb lamp and my 9w LED UV lamp.<br /><br />This thing cures Gelish and RCM so fast, and my manis are lasting so much longer without lifting or chipping. Most of the time now, I get bored or my nails grow too much before the polish even shows a hint of coming off. The LED placement is great, and it cures all 5 fingers at once with no trouble. There is a bit of heat, but it's minimal and I'd be surprised if anyone found it painful. I haven't tried the 99s low heat mode.<br /><br />The sensor feature is nice. I was under the impression that I could set the timer to 30s or 60s once and forget it, but so far it seems like I have to choose a time every time. If not, it goes on until you remove your hand. I haven't gone over 105 seconds, so I'm not sure how long it would go for, but it definitely doesn't have a default shut off of 99s as advertised. My open box didn't include a user manual. I'm hoping to find one online.<br /><br />The white of this model doesn't reflect as much light as those lined in silver. But it still leaks a fair amount of light. I'd definitely advise using glasses or averting your eyes. And make sure to keep kids away, because even the reflected light can be painfully intense.<br /><br />It comes off the base for doing pedicures, and while the magnetic components seem to work well and the pieces fit together nicely, I don't polish my toes so I don't use this without the base.", "images": [], "asin": "B01L1ZNNTC", "parent_asin": "B01L1ZNNTC", "user_id": "AHM357JXSXU2QKGGJ2JYQAJ45ZFA", "timestamp": 1498803029310, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

I was actually quite shocked at HOW close it comes to replicating the smoothness and softness of the much more expensive model. It has almost an immediate heat up,allowing me to start quicker, and because the temp controls are accurate, get finished quicker as well. The grip is not hard on your hands, and it it light and easy to use as well. When you have long hair, that's really important! My ONLY gripe is that the control buttons are in an awkward placement when the iron is hot. but one you use it a few times, you get the hang of where NOT to put your fingers when turning it off.

You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both.

These are as good as anything that I have. I've  tried stamping a few of the images and they all are very clear and crisp. I did these quickly on paper. The plates seem to be engraved well. It comes with two different kinds of stampers plus two scrapers. Both of the stampers work excellent.  I would definitely buy these again and others made by Bluezoo.  In fact I will be looking on Amazon for more plates made by them.  If you are new to nail stamping one thing to know is that you must take the protective covering off of each plate, it peels right off.  It takes some practice but once you have the hang of it you will love nail stamping.  I would definitely recommend this set, it would be a good starter set because  it comes with scrapers and stampers.  I would also recommend using thicker nail polish her polish made specially for nail stamping. It seems to be easier to use than trying to use common nail polish which tends to be a little thin and often smears.

You and your friends can definitely find a few temporary tattoos to show off your interests for your next girls night out concert! It is so much fun to dress up, and this is a form of dress up! It is a way to express yourself, temporarily! Haha!<br />These are great for kids, too! My girls love them! They love how different they are from their &#34;kiddie&#34; temporary tattoos and they think its so cool when I wear them with them! Haha! As I said above, it is another form of dress up, and what mom doesn't like to dress up with their kids?! It is so fun! And it is interesting to see which tattoos they pick and how they determine which tattoos they are going to wear for that round of dress up! They get so into it! I love it!<br />In addition to the many different designs that are in this set, there are also metallic and white tattoos! Metallic tattoos are so cool! It is like jewelry on your skin!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sturdily made and full of room!", "text": "This makeup storage bag is just fantastic!<br /><br />The backpack is very sturdily made and will definitely hold up to heavy use for years to come.<br /><br />The zippers zip and unzip smoothly, and run in both directions, making it quicker and easier to unzip in a hurry and not worry about them getting stuck.<br /><br />The main compartments are roomy, and allow multiple items to be stored inside. I took the boxes out in one photo to show the room available if you need it.<br /><br />On one side you have a smaller zippered comparment which has a thermal lined pocket inside which can hold hot tools such as straighteners and curling irons, and also allows for storage of extra items such as brushes and combs, or miscellaneous items.<br /><br />On the other side there is another zippered compartment which allows for more products, plus has an netted portion which opens to the outside to allow for tissues to be dispensed quickly and easily. There are slots in this pocket also which allow for small tools like scissors, combs , brushes, etc to be stored.<br /><br />the top handle is sturdy and has a nice grip that's easy to hold on to and carry around.<br /><br />I stored my blow dryer and some brushes in the top compartment, straightener in the side compartment, tissues in the other side, and filled all three boxes with makeup products, and then still had plenty of room left.<br /><br />All compartments are extremely easy access, whether holding the backpack with one arm and grabbing something out, or sitting it on a table or chair and unzipping with one hand. I love that the front compartment is velcroed so that once unzipped, it's still easy to close quickly and will keep everything secure until you have time to zip back up.<br /><br />This is fantastic whether you are a makeup artist heading to a show, or just a glamorous girl with lots of products on the go travelling.<br />Even at home this makes for great storage and easy accessibility.<br /><br />FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Product provided for my inspection and review, all thoughts and opinions are my own", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616FOpRmTPL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616FOpRmTPL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616FOpRmTPL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r6Se1nDKL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r6Se1nDKL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61r6Se1nDKL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbdVPKwAL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbdVPKwAL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61xbdVPKwAL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ffh9PCpiL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ffh9PCpiL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ffh9PCpiL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JV0KcwpTL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JV0KcwpTL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JV0KcwpTL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NlMP-p4JL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NlMP-p4JL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NlMP-p4JL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+g9XhUxL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+g9XhUxL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+g9XhUxL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B00TRLC8I0", "parent_asin": "B00TRLC8I0", "user_id": "AEVLTZZIS7RKWREI7TVDEDV2LSFA", "timestamp": 1436300269000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

I was given the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotional program at a discounted price in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.

It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.  The box holding the tube looked sturdy and professional - it looked like what you would expect from a high quality product.  I product dispenses easily and is easy to apply to the skin.  It goes on smoothly and evenly, doesn't dry out of make your skin feel tight, and doesn't have a strong or unpleasant odor.  My daughter and I tried the mask together - I have very dry skin, along with some fine lines and wrinkles, her skin tends to be oily and she had a few blackheads and larger pores.  We left our masks on for 15 minutes and washed them off with warm water.  The mask was very easy to remove and left our skin feeling very soft and looking radiant.  An additional bonus for me is the fact that mask contains argan, avocado, and jojoba oils.  Those added oils left my skin well nourished and moisturized.  I applied a light moisturizer because it didn't feel like a heavy one was needed.  My daughter was also pleased with the results.  She had concerns that the additional oils may cause her skin to break out or leave it feeling oily.  The mask washed off her face very easily, her skin felt smooth, her blackheads were gone, and her skin looked radiant.  We concluded that this mask is helpful for any skin type and we are planning another mother/daughter spa day soon.  We both liked the product and plan on continuing to use it.

Zotos is cheap! It's only $12.99 on Amazon. If you're interested, you can also check out their other products on their website.<br />Not only do I love the fact that it definitely makes my hair have more volume, but I completely adore the fact that the smell is amazing! This product has no harsh smells that some hairsprays have. It actually smells like you're getting your hair done in a salon with that amazing hair salon smell that I love!<br />This product is extremely unique because it has a blend of clay and silica. This enables the spray to feel dry as it goes on as well as help build texture that lasts for a whole night of partying, (or whatever you enjoy doing). It's also color safe which is an absolute huge bonus for me!<br />This is a super easy product to use as well. You don't have to have a special type of brush to use it to style your hair. All you do is open the cap, shake the product, spray onto dry hair.

I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic!

The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color. There are color dots included if you'd like to make your own color dot for each bottle, but I would much prefer that it arrive with the color on the bottle already so I don't have to.

I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a \"Gel-y\" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the \"300 hours\" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once. This light is great for storing and being portable, but I personally wanted something bigger. Overall a fantastic set.

It's very creamy, though, and when you put a dollop in your hand, it might seem like there aren't any salt crystals in it, because the cream is thick like lotion.<br />There was quite a bit of settling in the packaging when I opened the jar, and since I ended up using quite a bit in the shower, I don't think it'll last very long--perhaps a month. The salt crystals are very small, and when I tried to vigorously scrub, it washed away before I could properly exfoliate.<br />How I recommend using it, in order to get the best use out of the Himalayan salt is to wet your leg before you step unto the shower, so it's a little more than damp. Then take a dollop and scrub your leg, and when you're done with whatever appendages you wanted to exfoliate, hop in the shower and rinse it off.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Flower very nice, but birdcage veil difficult to handle", "text": "I purchased this for my upcoming wedding. The flower (called a \"fascinator\" in the bridal industry, I'm learning) is very nice, and I will definitely wear it. I may cut the wires with the bling off, but that's just me. I'm having a simple summer picnic wedding with a white, cotton halter dress, and the bling might be a bit too much. I am going to ask my best friend before making this decision. Either way, it's a nice piece.<br /><br />The birdcage veil, though, wasn't really how it's pictured. In the photo it seems to have a lot more conformity to a human head than the actual piece that showed up in my mailbox. The real thing starts out unruly, and popped up in weird places on my head. I tried calming the thing down with bobby pins, but it still looked unshapely. Finally, though, after watching the company's videos (they give you a piece of paper with a link to some instructional videos) and keeping it near the shower for a few days to get it to calm down, it did actually look good. I have a large head with puffy hair, and I found that if I put the comb towards the back of my head on the right, and allow the veil to come up over top my head from the back right, hanging down around my face, that the veil's large size is actually an asset, because it covers my puffy hair without flattening it.<br /><br />I was so worried about the veil that I ordered a separate, handmade birdcage veil from etsy for $30 (see it at pompandplumage.com) that I hoped would be more what I'm looking for. When it arrived, though, it was too small to wear without wearing my puffy hairstyle slicked back, which isn't how I plan to wear my hair. I actually went back to the cheaper veil I bought here on amazon.<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing with the veil portion, the flower/fascinator is nice enough, and cheap enough, that it's still worth the purchase. The flower/fascinators on the same site on etsy where I purchase the other birdcage veil, pompandplumage.com, are $60-$70, and look similar, so even without the veil, this was a good deal.", "images": [], "asin": "B007YV2R40", "parent_asin": "B007YV2R40", "user_id": "AELVV6ZH6OOR4T4RHJLW377QR7GA", "timestamp": 1363332004000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

These stuck easily and have adhered nicely - they have not moved or lifted (i put these in when the tub was clean and dry). My toddler likes that there are animals in the tub. The no-slip surface isn't too rough and it does prevent slips!<br /><br />Cons: I just wish there were more in a package - I had to buy 2 packs which wasn't the worst thing because I was able to get a 2nd print.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Needs Some Work to Make it work!", "text": "This was my first experience with a wig that wasn\u2019t from Spirit Halloween and I can\u2019t say it was much better. After trying this wig I decided to learn a little more about wigs and I found a ton of info out there about them and how to do a little work on the less expensive ones to make them look better. (ie: thinning them out, plucking the part and hairline, etc.) I also learned about the features of a wig that make it look more realistic, such as synthetic vs human hair/human hair blend, pre-plucked and lace front. Now that I know a bit about wigs I feel more optimistic that I\u2019ll be able to find ones that are affordable yet look more realistic and/or that I\u2019ll be able to work on them a bit to make them look more so. In summary: The part and thickness on this wig are what I think need the most work. There\u2019s virtually no part and the hair on the top is much too dense and puffy. This could be rectified by plucking but the wig is just not worth the work, IMO. The style of it is cute\u2014The length and the waviness of it were exactly what I was looking for. I can\u2019t say the same about the bangs but that\u2019s the part of the wig that would benefit from some plucking and thinning out. The softness is pretty good for a synthetic wig.  I can\u2019t comment on tangling because I didn\u2019t keep the wig long enough to see how it holds up. The color is hard to comment on because it looks so different depending on the light\u2014It can look like an ashy light brown with subtle highlights, a darker, less ashy light brown with no dimension to it, and in others it appears to have a mauve-like tinge to it. (You can see the differences in the pics.) In the end I returned this wig and after doing more research I decided I wouldn\u2019t buy another inexpensive synthetic hair wig and instead look for a human hair blend that may be a little more expensive but looks more realistic. The bottom line: I recommend not buying this wig unless you know how to work on a wig to make it look more realistic.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7153++IOF1L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7153++IOF1L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7153++IOF1L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f1kzpGsnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f1kzpGsnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f1kzpGsnL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZtmLoX2L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZtmLoX2L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZtmLoX2L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81atPP1YtZL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81atPP1YtZL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81atPP1YtZL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B083FMJWT9", "parent_asin": "B083FMJWT9", "user_id": "AFQZ6QZ3TW4JW4ZK57BA62AGY2QQ", "timestamp": 1640580587773, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Nice kit for beginners/parent child activity", "text": "I purchased this for my 7 year olds birthday. We got around to doing it tonite, finally. Overall, we were very pleased with this kit. Make sure the water temp and oil temps are spot on, add them and mix. Let sit, mix, let sit, mix, let sit, mix, etc. I was surprised how simple it was. It's nice how they combine oils and make everything into convenient packets of mixtures. Not having to measure really helps you focus on making the actual product while still keeping my daughters attention. She enjoyed this very much and was so eager for us to be able to stop mixing it and bottling it up.<br />My only gripe is the amount of lotion. We wanted to play with scents, so we used flavor oils we found in our cupboards. But, because they are tiny 2 oz jars, it was difficult to experiment with different scents. We did end up just taking out 2 oz of lotion, scenting, bottling, repeat. But, it was kind of annoying. For double the price of this kit, I saw another kit that makes 4x this amount of lotion. But, I believe ingredient wise, this kit is better. I love that this company chooses a natural preservative and that they use essential oils for scent. (It only comes with 1 scent - lavender) To make this kit better, they should increase the amount of lotion this makes and maybe offer a variety of essential oils to make a few different scents. I also wasn't quite clear on if they used unrefined or refined mango butter, but considering the small amount, it's not a huge deal. For the first timer, this is a great intro to DIY AND THE BEST PART: the lotion is lovely!! Makes my hands so soft and isn't greasy. I'm going to try making more lotions on my own :)  My daughter was so proud and just loved labeling her lotions and giving one to her brothers.", "images": [], "asin": "B01MXH427Q", "parent_asin": "B01MXH427Q", "user_id": "AEV6YAQS4YM5BHRSOVPMF55756GA", "timestamp": 1485842472000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

There are other names for this same style, one of them, Sultra which is SUPER EXPENSIVE ($149.00) for the SAME dryer.

The Big brush bristles are much better and they DO HAVE the little balls on the end.  BUT the TIP  of the brush does not have a enough space to put your fingers on while you are turning the brush.<br /><br />The picture above shows my old styler brush in the middle and their (Milantia) brushes on either side.<br /><br />Anyway, I found the Jinri on Amazon and ordered that one, it looks exactly like the one I have.  1000W is the same as my old one.

MY bottle tipped over without the lid on (thanks to my awesome toddlers!!) and I almost immeadiately ordered a whole new set. I could see results before even putting the mask on just from the prep. When you put step 2 the mask on your face you want to make sure that you dont make it too thick of a coating because it will take longer to dry (but this one still will unlike a lot of peel off masks that end up being scrub off because they dont ever harden and do what they claim they will. The third step is also a really good one it closes the pores to prevent them from immeadiately accumulating dirt again.

I've been using a flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the kinky nature.  This has worked great for me instead.  I wash it, dry it, and then just brush.  One word of caution, the nubs are very hot, so you can put your hand over them, also, your hair will be warm for a few seconds after you brush thru it.  I discovered I could use a dry wash cloth or heat resistant glove to assist in keeping  my hair against the warming surface.  As I place the brush under my hair & brush downward, I place my other hand (protected by cloth or glove) over the nubs, thereby holding the hair tight against the surface.  The smoothing effect is great without any burning of the hair like with a straight iron.  We also used it on my mixed race granddaughter whose hair is much thicker and kinkier.

Here are the things that didn't go as expected:<br />1)  It's not so easy to put them on and takes 5 tries before one is on<br />2) The velcro pulls hair and makes it messy and fizzy<br />3) Very hard to keep the ends secure, so I. had chunks of broken tips on the floor and sink as I took them off<br />4) The waves are not round as you sleep on it and some look bent depending on how you slept, so more of a kink than a curl<br />5) No way 8 rollers can cover the whole head, so you need at least 2 boxes to do it properly<br />6) the front of the hair looked awful, as it turned into my forehead with a kink<br /><br />All and all, it was a waste and I'm returning them.  Watching all the hair that was left in the rollers with the velcro and on the floor from breaking off, I find it damaging.", "images": [], "asin": "B07FHLW15G", "parent_asin": "B07FHLW15G", "user_id": "AFRJZNMGM4TPDEPYVGQRFFODHOTQ", "timestamp": 1545487463792, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

Other than an excellent shave, my favorite features are the \"time remaining\" and the \"needs cleaning\" indicators on the LCD screen. The unit quickly charges to the full 45 minutes of run time in about an hour and is easy to clean by simply flipping open the head assembly and rinsing under the faucet. Did I mention quiet? Yep, the 7885XL is whisper quiet. Did I mention close? I'm getting a closer shave than I've ever gotten from a hand razor.

This brush did a pretty good job with some of the worst tangles and I'm very pleased. However some of my hair overtime due to poor hairbrushes became too matted and will just have to be cut out. For me bore brushes have always been too soft. They control frizz, and make my hair shine on the surface but lack any kind of pull so that overtime my hair will get out of control. With most plastic and nylon brushes I am either breaking to much of my hair or causing myself pain while obtaining mixed results.  With that said,  this brush does a very nice job at keeping my hair under control and giving it that beautiful luster. It has just the right amount of rigidity to pull at those tangles, but it also knows when to give so as to keep these locks in gorgeous harmony. So if you like me are seeking a good quality hairbrush, possibly look at this one.

I have been using this for almost two weeks and I'm starting to notice my breasts do feel fuller. They are still the same size but the shape has improved. I am a former bf mom so they are not as perky as they once were. I wouldn't say this is a replacement for surgery or anything though. For me just seeing any improvement is exciting, so I am satisfied with this cream. I wasn't really expecting this to work in the beginning, I began to see a difference around the third day. I used it twice a day.<br /><br />The smell is a little different. It was musky to me. It doesn't smell bad.. but it could be better. The size is probably enough for a few months, I still have tons so a little goes a long way. The consistency is thick and really blendable. A little nickel sized amount is about what I use each time because it spreads easily. It really just feels like lotion on your skin, it isn't sticky or gel like.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this was the fragrance, the scent is not a scent I would normally wear but since it does seem to benefit my breasts it<br />Is a scent I can live with, I just spray perfume over my shirt and it covers it up.<br /><br />Overall I am happy about this cream, even with the change being suttle so far it still has some affect and that's better than nothing for me.

It feels like putting thickened water on your face, but instead of evaporating, it stays on your face and continues to moisturize. I have been using it as a lightweight moisturizer after i wash my face with either an AHA or BHA facewash, so that it really sinks in. That said, it is not enough to use it as a standalone moisturizer, probably exactly because it's non greasy and doesn't create a barrier on your face to keep the moisture in. It says on the bottle to follow up with a moisturizer, and I will but I wanted to test it out alone first.<br />I really like the dropper packaging - you can be very exact about how much serum you're using. I have tried it with different amounts. Today I used only 1/3 of a dropper, and I still feel like it was too much product so next time I will try it will 1/4 dropper. It comes shipped with a screw on cap that you can save and use for travel.<br />I have to say that this really does work. My face feels plump and moisturized with no tight feeling on the surface. It's light enough to put even under my eyes and I don't fear that it will cause millia or clogged pores. I don't have a lot of fine lines yet (36), but my skin is prone to flaking and this takes care of that, all day.<br />It has a very light smell - kind of herbal, but light and inoffensive.<br />I should mention that I received this in exchange for a fair and honest review, and that I have tested and reviewed to the best of my ability.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EqM0Di6BL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EqM0Di6BL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EqM0Di6BL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01AS894AU", "parent_asin": "B01AS894AU", "user_id": "AEZWYTQOJNABTCHXCA3LWEGP62QQ", "timestamp": 1469655205000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The good, the bad and the ugly...", "text": "My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,<br />the good - I finally found a curler that 'fits' my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool's shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...<br />the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain't nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...<br />the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won't take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky. If you have coordination issues, well - things could get ugly.<br />SUGGESTIONS for use...wash your hands before use. I keep the little plastic clip to keep the tool closed. You could follow the advise of one person here to heat the tool with a dryer, but I think I may skip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great palette.", "text": "I ordered this palette in the 15 shade option. I wasn't expecting much from this makeup palette but I was wrong. Now granted, I cannot use most of the colors as I am super fair-skinned but I am able to use most of the left side of the palette.<br /><br />First, I have terrible dark circles. They are sort of a reddish-brown color. The yellow in this palette conceals them better than any skin-toned concealer I have ever tried. It not only covers but also brightens the area too. I also have a brownish spot on my cheek that bothers me every time I look in the mirror. I have tried everything to cover it. I went to a department store makeup counter hoping they could cover it. The makeup counter girl tried for what seemed like an eternity to no avail. She called her manager over to assess my situation. The manager tried to cover it as well, packing more and more concealer and powder but she also could not cover it. She finally said that it was texture and you cannot cover texture. It sounded like a copout to me. It has no texture, it is just a spot. When I apply the yellow in this kit is does wonders for the spot. It is barely noticeable, almost not at all which is better results than I have gotten in the past.<br /><br />I use the green to cover redness that I have around my cheeks and nose area. I just make sure to blend really well and then put foundation over it to get rid of the green. The purple is used to brighten your complexion. Just like with the green, I blend it well and cover with foundation.<br /><br />The best color that matches my skin tone for concealing is the color directly to the right of the purple. For reference I wear MAC Matchmaster SPF 15 Foundation 1.0. Nine times out of ten I am the lightest shade in any foundation. This color matches and is great at concealing.<br /><br />The darker shades are good for contouring but I prefer to use powder contour rather than cream, just a personal preference.<br /><br />Overall I really like this kit. It does a great job of concealing areas that are a constant bother to me. I am including photos of before and afters of my dark circles and the dark spot on my cheek. Hopefully they come out well and you can see the difference.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "This is my second Straightener Brush ever", "text": "However, as far as products go... I really love everything about the way this company presents itself, it's design, it's product and how well the product performs. It has a great warranty (my last one from a different company died in less than 5 months with no recourse), and it came with a bunch of great stuff, including this weird little paddle (the green & white thing) I couldn't figure out at first was a cleaning utensil, and now I really love. It helps you pull the hair from the brush.<br /><br />At almost 30 years old this year, I had spent most of my life hating my hair with a passion. I would wear hats, I would wear wigs, I could not figure out anything that could make me happy... and it's because I was completely inept with styling tools and doing anything that wasn't simple.  So I was beyond happy when someone recommended a straightening brush to me in the first place. Then I stumbled upon the best heat protection spray/frizz stuff ever... and I don't know what happened, for the first time in my life, I'm confident with my hair. So if you're on the fence about getting one of these, because you really have tried \"everything\" and you still hate your hair....I don't know, maybe try a straightener brush. All you do is brush your hair with it....and it changes things a lot.<br /><br />This brush though. I can not have enough good things to say about it. It came with everything! A heat protection glove (especially great if you have thick hair like me and need to go all the way up to 450 degrees!), the cleaning tool, a silicone bag to protect it, OH and the cord swivels. I absolutely love the shape and curve of the actual brush, and the sturdiness of the design. I can't see this thing actually needing replacing any time soon, honestly... and that makes me happy because I'm tired of buying stuff on Amazon and having it fail on me.<br /><br />Of all the purchases in the past 2 years on here I've made, this is easily one of, if not the best.... and I wanted to share the pictures of what it does to my hair, so you can see. That is what my hair looks like after being blow dried, and then straightened with this brush, which doesn't take long at all.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "It's not what I thought it would be", "text": "I gave this 3 stars for \"Softness\" because the brush is average to a bit firmer than what would be ideal and comfortable to use on your back, while the loofah strap is average.  The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the \"good exfoliating\" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the \"ouch, that's scratching me\" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for \"Easy to use\" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.  It doesn't seem like a cheap product that's going to warp and break easily if you keep it away from hanging to be soaked when it's not needed for use.  Putting it somewhere nearby where it stays dry is best.", "images": [], "asin": "B07C6CJMN2", "parent_asin": "B07C6CJMN2", "user_id": "AG5NZMWXNYH7COAU2FDBLQSVKLEQ", "timestamp": 1566100399132, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "What an upgrade", "text": "I usually get packs of cheapola showercaps from the dollar store (like a six pack of plastic bags with a rubberband, you know?) but they don't last long... So I had a vinyl one that lasted longer, but was really just that same old design that was just plastic tied to your head with elastic...<br /><br />This shower cap is... well, frankly, after the other ones I've used... luxurious. The material is not plastic, but more like the soft nylon on my windbreaker jacket. It's much quieter when I'm in the shower, which makes for a more peaceful bathing experience. It is also more comfortable, as the headband is more fitted. It's especially comfortable if you wear it over your ears... there's no pressure anywhere, but it still keeps your hair dry. I, personally, like to have my ears \"out,\" so there is some pressure to the top of my ears where the headband sits, but I don't mind it.<br /><br />The headband does stretch a bit for head size, but not as much as you might be used to if you've used shower caps with elastic bands. I kind of liked this... It makes it easier to get all my hair in it. I flip my head upside down over the shower cap, and the cap just kind of catches my hair like a bucket, and I can just tuck in any stragglers before flipping my head back up. If you need to tighten the headband just a little bit, you can re-tie the bow for a slight adjustment.<br /><br />No shower cap is going to be completely, perfectly water tight. You're always going to get a little bit of water around the edges unless you're really careful in the shower and take pains to avoid direct spray. I use a shower cap when I take a shower before bed and don't want to go to sleep with wet hair... a little bit of moisture doesn't bother me, as I'm not trying to protect a hairstyle or anything.

Augh!!  Since I am a second time breast cancer warrior with bigger fish to fry \u2014 I ignored my mostly white eye brows for about nine months \u2014 hoping they would eventually recover their natural dark brown color after my body recovered from all the chemo poison. Nope. Not happening.  No such luck.<br /><br />The mostly white eyebrows bothered me even more than the flat chest double mastectomy\u2014 because well a flat chest can be padded but having invisible brows left me feeling washed out and old.  So, I decided to fix my brows because that seemed like a doable relatively easy DIY thing.  I read lots of  articles on home dying eye brows. Then, based on article recommendations, I found this Godfey product on Amazon and after much research and watching DIY \u201cdye your eyebrows at home\u201d videos, I gave it a go and dyed my eyebrows at home exactly one week ago.  The results:  Yay!!!!  As everyone suggested, I put vaseline around my eyebrows to protect my skin.  I did one eyebrow at a time rather than both at once.  Also, due to my super sensitive skin, I only left the dye on for two minutes per brow.  Still, it worked perfectly.  My eyebrow hairs are still dark brown \u2014 one week after I dyed them.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful Oil For A Splurge- But Not Worth The Hype", "text": "This is a beautiful oil to treat yourself, but the bottle is misleading. If you look carefully, you can see that the liquid does not reach the bottom, that there is another glass bottom a ways up, making the bottle appear more full than it is. I took a star off for that because that's just not cool. They could make it in a smaller bottle & people would still pay $48 for it. It's a nice product. I wish, however, that it didn't have the olive oil in it, because that's what I think is causing acne in a lot of girls skin. For those with acne or if you just don't want to pay this much, you can get the same \"velvet\" results with rosehip oil. The Ordinary has one for 10 bucks. Rosehip oil can help reduce your inflammatory acne, get rid of acne scars, and clear your skin. Rosehip oil is an anti-inflammatory, able to reduce swelling and fluid buildup. Rosehip oil has a low rating of 1-2 on the comedogenic scale (a.k.a. not likely to clog dem pores). Plus, the linoleic fatty acids in rosehip oil have been shown to reduce oil production in oily skin types which can help prevent future acne. I received this Velvet Skin Drink as a sample & like others, I was impressed, but I found it for brand new & sealed for $24 on Mercari. Personally, because of the olive oil filler and the bottle deception, I wasn't willing to pay $48. They do some great marketing, evidently, as it's out of stock all the time. They make it sound like it's made of purely grapes, which it's not & the bottle deception just isn't worth the hype. Yes, the product is beautiful & makes your skin very soft, but is it softer than my Ordinary Rosehip oil? Nah. This is something nice to splurge on if I find a good deal, because of the of Sarantoni grapes, Resveratrol and lactic acid. But there are no studies on the benefits of these grapes over other grapes & they don't say how much Resvertal and lactic acid they use. I wouldn't consider this an active of any of those products.

I never knew what it was until recently :) sounds like something you use in the brakes on your car. hyaluronic acid (also known as hyaluronan) is a glycosaminoglycan, a type of molecule composed partly of sugars. Hyaluronic acid is actually a natural structural component of skin, and, in fact, is present in connective tissue throughout the human body.<br /><br />The awesome thing about Hydrolic Acid is its ability to retain moisture; it\u2019s considered to have a greater capacity to hold moisture than any other natural or synthetic polymer. In fact, one gram of hyaluronic acid is able to hold up to six liters of water. The hallmarks of youthful skin is its moisture content. A dried up face will age you quicker then anything.<br /><br />Hyaluronic acid can improve your skin\u2019s moisture content and at the same time strengthen skin\u2019s barrier; that is, the outer layers of your skin. A healthy barrier looks and feels softer, smoother, and plumper. This does all of that. Sense menopause I have suffered from dry skin. This has made a big difference in how my face looks and feels.

The banana color is great for brow bone highlighting.

They don't smudge if you wait for them to dry and then use a decent top coat.<br />The only thing I dislike, is the flakiness of the stamping polish around the nail bed, when it dries. It can be messy. Which is why a latex protector may help with clean up. But that's no big deal. Once all is said and done, a quick acetone cleanup or even a hand washing can remove the excess...and once I'm more experienced at application, it may get easier to avoid too. I admit I'm fairly new with stamping. And I would absolutely not remove a star for that anyway!<br />It does what is says. It applies great and looks amazing. It picks up beautiful with every stamper I have...about 10 different heads and 7 different styles of stamper. So, I'd say it's a good product.<br />I'd but them again and recommend them to anyone who's into stamping!<br /><br />Update:<br />Using it a few more times has shown that I just needed practice...it's amazing. Stamps beautifully. I'll add pics. The mess that isn't caught my latex skin protection, can easily be washed away after nails are top coated and completely dry, or with acetone and a brush.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great product. Pretty color purple. Good price. Great for nail art!!!", "text": "I got this to try as a cheaper alternative for liquid Latex nail protector. It arrived quickly. It IS absolutely a much more cost effective alternative for buying the tiny bottles individually. And this company has lots of color options too.<br /><br />What I did:<br />I received it and immediately painted it around a nail bed to test it's effectiveness. And since, I've compared it's coverage/ease of use/removability to a product that is intended for nail use (a liquid palisade product).<br />Results are:<br />it works EXACTLY the same. No harder or easier to use. So, if someone uses liquid Latex for nail art protection already, this IS absolutely a great alternative!!! Once I knew it would work great, I got out an empty nail polish bottle and used a little mini funnel and poured it in. I also decided to spice it up with glitter, like some of the more popular liquid Latex for nails companies have done...and it works perfectly still, and looks more exciting, and is amazing!<br />Verdict:<br />I will continue to buy this as my nail art protection. The other items (that are intended for nail art) work great for the same thing, but this is a cheaper and much more customizable option... which I like!<br />Keep in mind, you can use any empty polish bottles... just clean them out thoroughly first. The glitter is completely optional...but if you do use it, I recommend ONLY using the cosmetic grade glitters...craft glitters are just too cheap and they bleed and curl and ruin the stuff they get submerged in. And any tiny funnel would help you get it into a different container.<br /><br />I attached photos.<br />The pics include:<br />The actual product. What I used to &#34;make&#34; it easily applicable for nails. What it looks like when immediately applied, once dried (which dries to a darker shade), and how easy it is to remove with no residue!<br /><br />So, I say, this is a great option for nail art enthusiasts like me, and this product would probably also work for other latex uses (like it is shown on the bottle).

I don't always use every color in a palette and I don't always place the colors as directed, but in this case, Stila knows what they are talking about!<br /><br />The large color on the left is your all-over base, and I apply that first. Next, I go to the top right corner and apply this grayish color from crease to browbone. Third, I take the darkest color and place it quite heavily (but narrowly) in the crease and a little in the corner and lash line. Next, I put the highlight (lightest) color just under the brow and also outside the inner corner of the eye. Finally, I put the shimmery gold-like color in the middle across the lid and blend all the colors with a blending brush. I use the darker blush normally, but use the light one as a highlight if I want the added effect. I love that when I am doing my makeup on the run, I only have to grab this one container and my makeup brushes (I have the EcoTools Eye Enhancing Duo Brush set with four tips on two brushes, so even there you don't have to take as much with you).<br /><br />The quality of the product is excellent and it blends well.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great polish and great deal! Even you get repeats!", "text": "UPDATE 5/3/21: Got my second shipment today. All in tact! And great color selection!<br /><br />This is a really great deal. If it is packaged right. The first time, unfortunately the bottles arrived smashed due to poor packaging. This is not the vendors fault as it was shipped by Amazon. I told them about it and they gave me a full refund. I really wish they would take a little more care when shipping. Hopefully my next round will go better.<br />**UPDATE**  5/3/21: Got my second shipment today. All in tact! And great color selection!<br />This is my guilty pleasure. It is definitely like gambling. But once every month or so I take the chance and roll the dice.  Some times I get colors I do not have and other times I get 4 of the same. But guess what!?! You can mix these colors and get something that you like.  That is what I do. I have mixed some shimmery colors with solids and came out with a beautiful shade that didn't exist before! And for around $1 each it is such a great deal!!! Dollar store price but top salon quality. This polish has been discontinued which is really sad because it is my favorite by far. It goes on smooth, love the wide brush and consistency. It helps my nails grow and keeps them healthy and protected. Also it lasts forever. I mean the polish in the bottle will last forever. Like no expiration date. I have some that I have had for over 10 years and they still glide like they were new.<br /><br />** This is copy of my review from same product but bought different times and vendors***<br /><br />This a great price for 20 polishes. Buying them in the store would be like $6 or $7. I have to admit this is my favorite guilty pleasure.  It is like gambling lol. For around $1 a polish this is such a fun way to try new colors!<br /><br />I absolutely love this polish. I have used it for years. The nice thing about these polishes is that even after years they still perform as well as the new ones. I love how easy it is to apply. If I am in a hurry, one coat is fine. I like to take my time with my nails so I have steps (below).  I like to change my polish every week so chipping isn\u2019t a problem for me. Also I wear gloves when I do dishes or clean to extend the life of my nails.<br />I love that this polish dries fairly quickly if you don\u2019t put it on too thick. I mean, put on a coat while watching TV or on the PC. Careful not to touch anything! But let it dry thoroughly.<br />Then if you need a little more tint slap a little thin layer to make it pop. Also here are couple tips I learned through my years of doing my nails:<br /><br /> 1. Use the SH Complete Care 7in1 or 170 Clear'd for takeoff as a base coat. (I am pretty sure that is why it\u2019s called that... It makes sense to me) I know they say you don\u2019t need one with this polish, but really it is for easier removal. It makes your life so much easier! Especially with darker colors that seem to get in the creases and under your nail that are a pain to remove.<br /><br />2. Use a white polish (121 let\u2019s snow for example) under any color to make that color really pop. You don\u2019t need a really thick coat of white either. Just enough to give a canvas for the bright color to pop.<br /><br />3. This polish is a little thick so mind that when you apply it. Put one streak down the middle of your nail (your first application to each nail) this will be a little thicker then go to each side and touching the outskirts of the middle line to grab some of the excess there to spread to the sides.<br /><br />4. I use Sally Hansen Salon Manicure Top Coat as well to seal the color in if I am not using a Salon Manicure Glitter Overcoat. I think they both help preserve the color.<br /><br /> 4b. I know glitter can be intimidating because it\u2019s such a pain to get off. Don\u2019t let that deter you. If you like the look of glitter go for it! There are polish removers designed for that now. As well as the polish remover in the jar that you put your finger in to remove color. There is one that has little ridges (or brushes) inside the center wall that help strip the glitter. Can\u2019t tell you where or who. But I can say you probably have one in your town.<br /><br />5. For those of you that like a little shiny nail but not necessarily color. I use the 170 Clear\u2019d for takeoff and add some drops of any sheer color (Arm Candy, Sheer Ecstasy, Sweet Talker, Shell We Dance, Pink Slip) it just looks like a natural nail with clear polish only it hides blemishes! And your nails look super awesome! I get compliments all the time about how healthy my nails look when I do that.<br /><br />I hope these tips help. These are things I have learned over the years. I love doing nails and I am glad to share the things I have discovered to save someone else some frustration or time.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hN0g1oNwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hN0g1oNwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hN0g1oNwL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Y9m5BLZhL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Y9m5BLZhL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Y9m5BLZhL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tzyA6JO6L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tzyA6JO6L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tzyA6JO6L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B00GLOS060", "parent_asin": "B00GLOS060", "user_id": "AGDW3JPKVRSMUFGMMIUAYKVFGPBA", "timestamp": 1619735254181, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Wonderful Time Saving Device", "text": "I am SO thankful that this product was created! They took a hair straightener and a brush and combined it into one simple and super easy step! Since I was born with a tremor, the shaking of my hands would cause me to burn myself often whenever I straightened my hair. Thanks to this straightening brush and it's super cool bristle tips, I haven't burned myself once when using it. On days that my hands are extra shaky, I use the gloves that were provided with this brush, so can be extra careful not to burn myself. The design of this brush is beautiful. I can't imagine one could be any better. The rose color is really nice. One feature that I like about the brush that I've never seen on a product of it's type is the fact that you are able to watch it heat up to whatever temperature you prefer. It takes only seconds for it to reach the temperature you set it on. Another pro about this brush is the negatively charged ions. When using a hair tool that emits negatively charged ions, they cause bunches of H2O molecules to break down into small ones, which helps the device to work better and faster. This is SO much better on your hair. It also seals the hair's cuticle which calms frizz and flyaways. The brush comes with a pair of heat resistant gloves, 2 hair clips, a cleaning brush, all in a nice box. I keep the brush and all of the parts stored, conveniently, in the box. I have no regrets about getting this brush. I included  pictures without me wearing any makeup nor did I put ANY hair products on my hair. I ONLY used the brush. I highly recommend it. Please excuse my terrible hair cut.

I was searching Amazon up and down for a heated eye mask that can be worn like a sleeping eye mask to relax my eye muscles after sitting at a computer all day when I finally came across this one. I don't care for the color or the kitty design, but the purple material is velvety soft which I do like.<br /><br />The mask easily covers my head, though I do have a small head, and the strap fits around the back of my head pretty well. I do choose to wear my hair up at night when I use this heating mask otherwise the strap slides up my straight fine hair slowly if I move my head from side to side. And I somehow never wake up with it on, though I'm thinking that has much more to do with me removing it during the middle of the night vs a product error.<br /><br />The power cord is composed of two pieces, the first has one end with a USB and the other as a round female piece. Connected to the mask on the right side is the other piece of the cord. This piece has a male round piece and connects perfectly to the female piece. I imagine this design is intended to allow the cord connected to the mask to easily be pulled out if the person moves during sleep.<br /><br />I plug the cord right into my USB-hub with my phone charger and it works perfectly well.<br /><br />The controls on this are odd, and you are provided zero instructions. There are two buttons I believe one is a (-) that is indented and the other is a (+) that is raised if my memory serves me right. You have to keep one side pressed down until the unit turns on, then I press the indented button because the numbers go up to 60 on this side. The numbers displaced are bizarre and I have no idea what unit of measurement they are - though degrees Celcius makes the most sense.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this product had was sewn in contours for the nose and eye sockets so it was able to lay more flush with your eyes. This would allow your eyes to feel a more direct heat.

I've started cloth diapering & using un-paper towels.  I've switched to natural body & laundry products.  However, for some reason, I had been holding out on switching to chemical free cleaning and fabric/air fresheners. I'm not exactly sure why I was so hesitant. These bottles made making the switch fun and easy!<br /><br />These bottles have both a mist and a stream spray option, as well as an option to turn off the spraying mechanism.  Currently, I have one bottle filled with a 1:1 ratio of water to vinegar for use as glass cleaner.  The mist option works well on my mirrors and shower doors.  The mist option also works very well for both my homemade room/linen spray and my pest repellent spray. (Peppermint essential oil diluted with water and sprayed on the baseboards/around door and windows.)  I use the direct stream option for my tub and tile cleaner.  It works very well for spraying directly onto the grout.<br /><br />At 16oz, the bottles are substantial but are not heavy in hand. The trigger is easy to squeeze, yet not flimsy.  The glass itself is a gorgeous, deep cobalt blue.  I keep my homemade air freshener in one of these bottles on the bathroom counter and have been asked multiple times about where I got it.  They really are just so very pretty.  Too pretty to be hidden under the sink like most other air freshener or cleaning supply bottles.<br /><br />Often times, when you purchase cleaners from the store in inexpensive plastic bottles with these same mechanisms, the spray head tends to leak after a week or two of use. It never fails.  These, however, are sturdy and seem to be much more heavy duty.  I've used these bottles nearly daily and have not had any leaks whatsoever. As beautiful as these bottles are, this is what impressed me most. I'm extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend them!<br /><br />*I received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.*", "images": [], "asin": "B017JO1TXQ", "parent_asin": "B017JO1TXQ", "user_id": "AEIW3WB5JDZC5ZCWNE3BW5YNOPGA", "timestamp": 1460345149000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. No tears, no ripping, no holes. (In fact it cleaned up really well). I used some extra pulling pressure on the cut parts, mouth, eyes chin, and as expected had tears and stretching happen, but that was with abnormal applied pressure.<br />They didn't smell, they didn't feel weird, and they fit great.

The colors are kind of fun, although the yellow looks a little too similar to dehydrated urine. The huge con for me is the smells are so overtly chemical. They smell like bad laundry detergent. The smell is heavily concentrated when you first pour, as it fills the air of your bathroom with its harsh chemical smell. This subsides a little after a while, but the fake synthetic chemical smell doesn't really relax me.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "PROS and CONs", "text": "I\u2019ve been single-blade shaving for about 5 years. I enjoy trying out different blades and soaps. This is one of my stand-byes so I can recommend this soap.<br /><br />1. SHAVE: EXCELLENT.  Mitchell\u2019s is very slick and leaves very little tendency to cut or scrape. It results in a close, smooth shave in two passes. Most premium soaps result in a good-to-excellent shave.<br /><br />2. SKIN: EXCELLENT. This product contains lanolin and results in the very best and softest after-shave experience of any soap I\u2019ve tried.  Most premium soaps result in a fair-to-good experience for me.<br /><br />3. VERSATILITY: GOOD. Some soaps seem to shave very well with one brand of blade and not others. Mitchell\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to mind. I use ASTRA and generally sharp blades.<br /><br />4. LATHER: FAIR. This soap deposits easily onto a wet badger brush, sufficient to lather onto the skin and shave well. It does not whip into a full thick lather if that is important to you. It is also reputed (I have no direct experience) to be difficult to lather at all if you have hard water.<br /><br />5. LATHER DURABILITY: GOOD. The lather on the brush lasts OK during the shave. Easily enough for two passes.<br /><br />6. PUCK DURABILITY: EXCELLENT.  I tend to rotate among several brands of soap, and most milled soaps collect enough water from the brush to decay and dry out somewhat before the puck is finished. Mitchell\u2019s lasts to the end.<br /><br />8. VALUE: FAIR. Mitchell\u2019s is priced about the same as other premium milled soaps.

Also, if you're having trouble charging it, that's because you're not likely following what it says right in the instructions...it must be charged for a FULL 24 hours before the first use.  Do this, and it works fine. The neckline trimmer is a godsend.  My neck hair grows faster than that on my head so this does nicely for a neckshave when I don't really need a haircut yet.  Professional haircuts are getting too expensive everywhere to go in every 3-4 weeks when you don't need a full cut but do need a touch-up.  This does the trick in that respect.  The nose hair attachment works fine...again, the idea is not to get to the point where the hair is so long and thick that it doesn't work.  Groom it, keep up with it as it grows.

No matter how high the temperature (even 90+ days) there is an immediate cooling sensation that is nothing short of pure delight.<br /><br />One other concern I had was that this product might result in dry skin.  Again, I was pleasantly surprised.  My skin feels soft, supple and hydrated.  In hot weather, it beats out regular lotions hands down.

I was using tresemme\u2019s keratin shampoo & conditioner previously, but I\u2019m now pregnant so I wanted something a little more natural. I\u2019m white, my hair is on the thicker side, it\u2019s natural state is frizzy/somewhat wirey and wavy, my scalp is fairly dry - not to the point of dandruff, but it takes a few days for my hair to look dirty usually. I can get it to curl great in the summer and it straightens well in the winter. The tresemme stuff was perfect for the winter, I could get up to 4 days with straightened hair, no frizz or oily hair at all. I get a day or two less with this stuff before the dandruff sets in and it looks oily. It feels like it strips my hair of oils, so I can\u2019t get my fingers smoothly through it when wet (before the conditioner) or even when dry and straightened, and my hair frizzes more easily. It does have a pleasant but mild scent. I also feel like I have to use way more to get the same effects while washing. It\u2019s just passing the mark as acceptable for me.

The question is, for how long, considering the flimsy construction of some components and the already below-specified battery life.<br /><br />Things they don't describe in the mostly worthless manual:<br /><br />The charging indicator is a steady red AC plug symbol.<br /><br />The LCD indication at full charge is 99.  A RED (not a far more intuitive GREEN) battery full symbol is shown at when the charge reaches 99.<br /><br />A low battery is indicated by a flashing red AC plug symbol when the charge number on the LCD reaches 10.<br /><br />Charge time was tested and found to be 82 minutes.  The manual claims 60 to 90 minutes, so they got that right.<br /><br />Use time is specified in the manual as 50 to 60 minutes. The run time was tested and found to be only 30 minutes in 5 minute on, five minute off intervals, just free running and not being used to shave which should further reduce the run time slightly.<br /><br />The charge indicator was at 52 after 25 minutes and then rapidly dropped from that to 10 only five minutes later causing the low battery indicator to flash, so I would definitely NOT trust the charge indicator to be an accurate indication of how much shaving time you have left. They are apparently not calculating percent charge remaining and displaying it on the LCD, they are simply and far less usefully displaying percent battery VOLTAGE which drops off rapidly at what is called the battery's discharge \"knee.\" A cheap route to take revealing that the LCD display is nothing more useful than a gimmick.<br /><br />The manual states that the razor should be unplugged from the charger (this razor package does not come with an AC to USB charge adapter) when the charge number reaches 99, so I suspect this charger might not have an intelligent charger which stops the battery charge process at full charge to avoid battery damage over the long term. So, I will not put this razor on charge and just forget about it until my next shave like I can with my Norelco with its intelligent charge system.<br /><br />Other information:<br /><br />The space under the heads which catches the beard shavings is very small.  Cleaning often will be a must.  We'll see how the hinge and head locking mechanism hold up.<br /><br />When opening the shaving head to clean, put a finger on it to slow its opening, otherwise it will rapidly flip open and if a razor element isn't locked into its place by its flimsy and not very intuitive to correctly replace locking ring, as it wasn't in my case, the razor element and its parts will be vigorously projected into an alternate universe.

So, basically there is NOTHING about it that I can recommend.<br /><br />No matter how good these are at exfoliating, I cannot recommend them due to the offensive/clingy/cloying/LONGLASTING odor.  I have used products like this before and there is always some odor during use...but these, well, days later after soaking my feet in baking soda water and then vinegar water, the incredibly floral+chemical odor still wafts around my head--yes, all the way from my feet!  It is sickening, offensive,, and embarrassing when I am around other people.  Also, the socks I put on after using this product have been washed in hot water and laundry detergent and they are just going to have to be thrown away because the odor DOES NOT come out.  I threw away second set of these bootees because I cannot subject myself to the odor again no matter how badly I want my feet to be soft without rough skin.

I'll probably buy these again just because I can easily travel with them and use in gifts, but I am going to look for larger ones that I can use on a more regular basis.

I'm glad I also ordered 53 light beige because I usually end up mixing the two to get it just right. Maybe in the winter this will match better. I also wish there were more shades available, but then ordering over the internet is tough with foundation when you can't compare in person. I apply it with a Real Techniques sponge, and it goes on nice and smoothly. I tried it with a brush, but it kind of looked streaky. Since I also have dry skin, the sponge works better for me anyway. It feels really nice. It feels almost like bare skin but slightly better, like nicely moisturized skin. With a makeup setting spray, I get pretty good coverage for about 8 hours. It might last even longer, but that's as long as I've worn it. Once it seemed to wear off early, but I didn't use setting spray that time either. Also, it's summer and humid here, so I think that makes all makeup wear sooner. I think it would be a great winter time foundation for the extra moisturization and the shade I have is just a shade or two lighter than I need. It is fairly light to medium coverage, but I can build up to good medium coverage.

The first week or so was a little tough, as my skin reacts poorly to new skin care regimens...I saw an increase in my oil secretion, but this is a typical reaction for me.

There are things I really like about it and things that I don\u2019t.<br />I bought it in the shade 04 Honey. In the bottle it looks like an almost exact match to my skin, but when I put it on it\u2019s much paler with a decidedly pink undertone, yet it doesn\u2019t look orange or too pink in my skin. I prefer a neutral undertone though since my skin can be both yellow and pink.<br /><br />I love the bottle and packaging. It comes in a frosted glass bottle with a pink pump and pink cap that snaps on tightly.<br /><br />The coverage is much higher than I expected and it is heavier than expected for a luminous foundation.<br /><br />It covers blue tones better than redness. I have typically had to build it up in areas I have more redness (and we\u2019re talking average redness, not anything extreme) and doing this makes it look much heavier so I end up using a concealer instead. The problem with this lies in the finish.<br /><br />So this foundation\u2019s finish is very confusing and hard to describe. It is very glowy and luminous without being shimmery but it has the heaviness of a matte. I know, confusing.<br />Areas can look too greasy or too dry. It settles into fine lines and creases around the eyes and nostrils. For this reason this is not a foundation I choose for the daytime. It\u2019s much too heavy and shiny for the day, which is a shame because I enjoy it\u2019s longevity. Once I set it with some powder around the eyes and my nostrils I really enjoy it for a night out.<br /><br />I should also mention it is heavily perfumed with a floral scent so those sensitive to scented foundations will likely want to give this a pass. It\u2019s not bothersome to me personally but fragrance can irritate really sensitive skin.<br /><br />All in all I don\u2019t use it as much as I hoped I would and probably won\u2019t repurchase based on that and how heavy it is. At 36 I want a foundation with decent coverage but a lighter feel. It\u2019s also not the easiest foundation to completely remove and when I wear it I have to use a cleaning oil and a cleanser both AND a miceller solution.<br /><br />I have combo skin that can be prone to breakouts with certain brands but I haven\u2019t broken out from this foundation.<br /><br />I enjoy Holika Holika\u2019s BB cream which is why I gave this a shot (and I like a luminous foundation) but I\u2019ll probably stick with the BB cream in the future since it\u2019s lighter.", "images": [], "asin": "B07KXHWB9D", "parent_asin": "B07KXHWB9D", "user_id": "AEYFVB4VV6K3FGS463K6Z7RM7NSQ", "timestamp": 1567820596035, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Highly recommend this company'S products.", "text": "First, I want to say I bought this at full price....period!<br /><br />I've been very lax over years, at any kind of skin care routine.  My skin isn't really showing any effects of bad skin care, because I was blessed with really good skin, but....I'm 52 now and decided I really shouldn't push it any longer.  So; I purchased Tree of Life Beauty Vitamin C wash first.  I was very impressed with the ingredient list, the amount used to wash my face (neck, chest, and shoulders as well), and the way my skin felt afterwards.<br /><br />So when I saw the toner was 93% organic, I decided buy the Tree of life Beauty Toner, to go along with the wash.  First of all, I really am impressed with the ingredients this company uses.  I grow all organics herbs, berries, vegetables, etc. and use as many organic ingredients that I can.  I would love to be a purist, but my budget says &#34;NO!&#34;  This company doesn't use a lot of needless filler ingredients to stretch the product.  So when you think of the product being only 8 oz, you can be assured that 8 oz (when used properly), is a good amount of product that will last.  I can't say how long yet, as I've only been using it a week.<br /><br />Secondly, being an herbalist has taught me that your skin is your largest organ!  You should be careful what you put on it.  Your pores soak up every last drop of whatever you put on your skin.  Parabens are absolute poison and should be avoided like the plague!  (Sorry all of you Vicks and vasaline lovers out there)  From what I've read about Tree of life Beauty, we're on the same page and I don't feel I need to be concerned about them hiding any in their products.<br /><br />And finally, Vitamin C is essential to your body in too many ways to go into.  But I take a vitamin C daily to help with the absorption of Collagen 1&3 (Which is important for hair, skin, nails, bones, joints, etc).  I had not realized the benefits of vitamin C for your face.  I absolutely love the way my skin feels after using the cleanser and toner.  I let it dry well, then follow up with moisturizer both morning and evening.<br /><br />So far, I'm quite happy with Tree of Life Beauty products and will probably transition to more of their products as I use up what I already have.  We'll see how it goes after using these items for 30 days.", "images": [], "asin": "B014P8G0SS", "parent_asin": "B014P8G0SS", "user_id": "AHBA2VLEN2DEPNQDRMV3S2OU6XRA", "timestamp": 1462641069000, "helpful_vote": 36, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Product packaging concerns", "text": "The name \u201cHoney Bee Smooth Bath & Body Scrub + Moisturizer\u201d just evokes good thoughts, doesn\u2019t it? If you love honey, it just sounds amazing. I know I love honey and I love using it or having it in my beauty products, so I was looking forward to receiving this product to test it out.<br /><br />There are some actual product packaging concerns that really should be addressed by the company that makes this body scrub. First off, the jar is pretty sturdy, I\u2019m not going to dispute that and it\u2019s amber, which is always good in helping keep out UV rays. The ONLY seal is the Amazon barcode label (One of the photos shows the label, but I cut through it, it was intact when it arrived - so that was not the issue). There was no shrink wrap seal, neither was there an inner seal, nor one of those inner lid liners. This jar also does not have ANY other labeling except for that Amazon barcode and the top label with their website URL. This was a standalone jar, no box. There is no product information on the jar, no ingredient list, no product name, no manufacture or expiration dates. This brings up heavy red flags for me \u2013 quality control especially.<br /><br />The product description sounds rather amazing, right? Ok, keep in mind what I previously mentioned about quality control. In their description they advertise that you can EAT it. I\u2019d recommend against it because of the lack of quality sealing. It would be one thing if this were given to me by someone who I knew personally that had made the product, but since this is coming from a company that I don\u2019t know and that doesn\u2019t have anything other than the description on Amazon, I\u2019m not sticking this product in my mouth. I know the anti-bacterial properties of honey, however, that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be contaminated by anything else -1) it\u2019s not pure honey, there are other ingredients within, 2) who knows the health/sanitation practices of this company, right?, 3) with there just being the barcode label as a seal, who\u2019s to say that someone couldn\u2019t have tampered with it in the warehouse?, and 4) their only label \u2013 the one I mentioned with their website URL \u2013 if you go to the URL, it comes up with:<br /><br />\u201cThis webpage is not available<br /><br />ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\u201d<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about you, but without anything reputable to back up the product or company, I find it very hard for me to trust this.<br /><br />ALL of that aside, if you can look past those packaging and trust issues, getting to the actual product\u2026<br /><br />When you open the cover, it does have that very rich strong scent of honey. The brown sugar and other ingredients have settled to the bottom, so some stirring was necessary \u2014 the honey is also pretty solid, so a cosmetic spatula (not included) was not adequate enough to stir it.  Once you do stir it, the scent of the brown sugar comes through.  Because it\u2019s honey, it\u2019s really sticky, and like any sugar scrub, it has that gritty sugar texture which is great for exfoliation.  If your skin is dry when you apply, you may have a tough time spreading it, to avoid this, moisten your skin prior to smoothing this along.<br /><br />It does its job at exfoliating, removing a layer of dead skin, but I didn\u2019t expect that it wouldn\u2019t. The product itself is good, leaves the skin smooth and smells good \u2013 I used it on my leg.<br /><br />It\u2019s not proprietary though, since there are a ton of DIY tutorials on how to make sugar scrubs out on the web nowadays. But if you\u2019re not into making your own and if they change the packaging and labeling and get a working website up, then this would be the way to go.<br /><br />I really hope that they get the concerns I mentioned in the beginning straightened out. It would have been a decent product all around if not for those issues. If they do, then I'd be more than happy to bump the rating to a 4.

I purchased the silver 18 inch set. My first hair extension application and it went well! Of course my husband had to help!<br />We watched a YouTube video and applied the tape by sandwiching a small section of hair between each. He also used the hair straightener (which I think was the trick for lasting adhesion) to squeeze the tape onto my hair for a few seconds. For the most part they did pretty well. I\u2019ve had them in for about 2 months. They don\u2019t handle washing very well so I tend to really condition the ends and need to trim them occasionally as they will fray a bit and break after a lot of styling.

And unless you live in a subtropical climate, one of the oils in the mixture comes out in a semi-solid state and must be rolled between your palms to liquify it as well.  Once that is done, your hands will be pretty thoroughly coated on both sides and between the fingers.  Then you must work it into your beard.  It did a pretty good job of softening my scruffy beard. But now its time to clean the oils off my hands using the sink full of hot water I soaked the tube in.  An oily film can be seen in the water, but my hands still feel oily.  No worries.  The remaining oil get absorbed into my hands.<br />  The instructions say to use a \"manly amount.\"  But that begs the question, how much is a manly amount?

I don't have split ends and never noticed them,except for a long,long time ago when I was a teenager;but,I have used these once to do some light trimming and shaping;with wavy hair you are always shaping,cutting with the wave and not cutting against the wave.

I still have half of it left and expect I will run out of it sometime in mid-2013. What a way to stretch a dollar!  I saw this color, Love, which is not available in the store, and was attracted to what appears to be more of an earthy, rich and darker color than Rosy. I ordered it and it arrived yesterday. I was disappointed to find a pale mauvish color and did not have high hopes for how it would look on me, as I have never liked mauve colors on me. This morning I tried it anyway, fully expecting to hate it. Within about 20 minutes I noticed the most natural-looking vibrant bloom in my cheeks, attributable only to this! I love the silky texture  and it does not feel sticky or greasy on my face at all.  Just pure healthy moisturizing (thanks to the argan oil in it) color that I am so glad to have. It has more of a matte effect  on the skin than does Rosy, which is more glossy and sheer. Both colors last all day on my face, even in extreme heat and humidity.<br /><br />The price may seem expensive but considering my first one is still fresh and going strong after 19 months, it's actually a steal! Smells pleasant, too - rather like fresh berries.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "There Are Better Norelcos", "text": "Since this model seems to be discontinued there probably isn't much chance of you finding one for sale. But just in case you do, don't get it.<br /><br />I've had this shaver for years now, buying it as a replacement for my previous Norelco that I dearly loved. But I had put so many years on that one, and when it was time to replace the battery and heads (about $80.00 total), I figured it was time to just get a new one.<br /><br />This was the first frustrating part of the process, finding a replacement. Norelco makes so many models. I was looking for one on sale as to limited funds. I soon found out a lot of things I didn't like. These shavers are no longer made in Holland, to fine exacting standards, but are now made in China. They are of varying quality, even within the same model, so you get the luck of the draw. This new model, for twice the money, did not have a battery charge indicator on it, and they no longer have the head height adjustment. And it was LOUD! All for TWICE the price of my old Norelco shaver that was made in Holland, had the battery indicator, and the adjustable heads.<br /><br />So right away, I considered rebuilding the old one. I should have. This shaver grabbed my hair (still does), gives me razor burn, is made out of a more flimsy plastic, doesn't hold a charge nearly as long as with past models, and is just all around a poor replacement, for, did I mention, TWICE THE MONEY!<br /><br />So I've put up with it for years now and am at the same place again. The heads and battery need replacing for a cost of over $80.00 and I'm sure not going to put that into this shaver. So it's off to the reviews again to find a new shaver. I understand that now that Philips has purchased Norelco that their quality has begun to come back up while their prices have stayed the same or even gone done some. I hope this is true as the alternatives don't exist.<br /><br />In a word, you get what you pay for and with the 6843XL Reflex Plus, you don't get much!", "images": [], "asin": "B00009RB0Z", "parent_asin": "B00009RB0Z", "user_id": "AFQOWS53WHEFRW2W6AWOQ2MOEMZQ", "timestamp": 1248108536000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Well, I must say, I am very pleasantly impressed with this palette.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Nice!", "text": "Update 05Oct2020:<br />I used the lavender bath bombs last night and remembered to take pictures of the water this time. The lavender bomb really did make my water a very pretty purple. When I used the eucalyptus bath bomb, it really did my water a really pretty blue green color. My tub didn\u2019t stain, nor did my bath billow. And since I got rid of the horrendous item that I kept having to mess with that caused me to make the pillow keep sliding, the pillow stayed put this time. I HIGHLY recommend this product!<br /><br />I received this two days ago, 19 September 2020, and I put it to use yesterday 20 Sept 2020. I\u2019m really happy with this purchase. My initial impression was very positive. It really did look like it came straight out of a spa. It was squishy and felt comfortable. The bathbombs were a great touch. And it came with a very large mesh bag so that you can wash in there and not ruin it (I think, that\u2019s what that is for). When I used it yesterday, it really did feel comfortable and there were no pressure pains. It did slide a bit down, but was easy to slide back up into position (I think it was also sliding because I kept having to adjust another item not from this purchase). The bathbomb that I used yesterday was the eucalyptus one. The fragrance in the box was nice, once I opened it, the fragrance was more subtle. It turned my bath water blue! It looked really nice but then I was thinking it was going to stain my tub blue. After I drained my tub there were no stains (phew!). The actual bath pillow was very easy to rinse off and hang up to dry. It was overall a very pleasant experience. The way this came, would make a great gift for someone. I know I would LOVE to have received this as a gift.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61WkQHRK-rL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url":

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Comprehensive review of robusta coffee scrub", "text": "I recently used this scrub and felt inspired to write a review about it for those that aren't sure if they should get this scrub or not.<br /><br />Before buying this scrub, I was aware coffee scrubs have been trending for a year or so.  As others, I was very skeptical about it and wasn't sure how I felt about this beauty trend. The only way I was going to find out was to give it a try.<br /><br />Here's what I learned after using it that I think will help others should you decide to try it:<br /><br />1) Prepare your environment and set aside time before using it - Prior to using the scrub, decide where you are going to use it (shower, bath, fenced backyard, etc.) because I'm warning you now, it's gonna get messy. I have a regular sized shower/bath, so if I plan on using this again, I would get myself completely wet, sit in the tub, use the scrub all over my body, rinse off (still sitting), then finally stand up to complete washing off.  If you have a private fenced off backyard where you are near a hose, that's a good setting too.  The whole process took approximately 40-50 minutes (I like to take my time). I used the whole pack because I literally used it all over my body, but you can use whatever amount you want.  Just know that you will need time to really work it into your skin and let it set for a few minutes before washing it off.<br /><br />2) Be honest with yourself about your skin regimen - What I mean is, if you are not disciplined about your skin regimen or don't want to take time to use this scrub, then honestly I don't know this product is going to work for you. Personally, I'm committed to a regular and consistent skin regimen and set aside time to use this product to get optimal results.\u00a0I am just saying this isn't like a typical scrub and takes more time to work it in to your skin.<br /><br />3) You'll likely need soap to get the rest of it off - Even after a rinse, it will stain, just like coffee will do, so I used some shea butter body wash and a body brush to get the rest of it off.  Once I was completely clean, I dried off and used body shop cocoa butter all over my body (it's what I usually use anyway).<br /><br />4) For people with very oily skin be aware - Since this product has coconut oil and you are highly prone to breaking out, I'm not sure if this is a good idea; the amount of coconut oil is definitely noticeable so just be aware.<br /><br />The verdict: I will say, this made me feel amazing afterwards. My skin felt very smooth and soft. That being said, I bought it without having any expectations. I tried it mainly out of curiosity. As there are advances in beauty products, I am naturally going to want to try new things. I have heard that coffee scrubs reduce cellulite or supports regeneration of new skin cells. Honestly I don't know if that's true and frankly find that doubtful.  However, I can say it is better than most scrubs I've used in the past, and it's a wonderful treat for the skin from time to time. I would buy and use it again for occasional use.", "images": [], "asin": "B01E6EWCA6", "parent_asin": "B01E6EWCA6", "user_id": "AE2WFO6376DYD2DT4HPNT3L2HQSA", "timestamp": 1488162823000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

I understand the metal was likely placed there to protect the blade and prevent unnecessary dulling and the build up of gunk. Most razors on the market today have a strip of lotion or emollient along the top of the blade. Unfortunately, the metal from the pod kept fusing to the strip causing both the strip to come off and the plastic of the pod to pull free - resulting in both a broken pod and a damaged and unusable razor. I would also caution this company regarding the name and claim of the product.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Thick and Rich Eye Cream.", "text": "EDITED REVIEW as of 9/25/21.<br /><br />I came back to edit this review and to lower my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. Here's why:<br /><br />After a few weeks of using this cream, I started to develop some sensitivity to it. When I say sensitivity, here's what I mean: 1) The scent bothered me more than it did when I first used the cream. In fact, I started to sneeze most evening after applying it. 2) I'd used the cream on other areas of my face, and noticed minor breakouts in those areas.<br /><br />Basically, I think the cream was just too oily for my skin. Even around the eye area, which has virtually no oil glands, the non-absorbency of the cream left me feeling sticky and greasy even though I gave the cream plenty of time to absorb.<br /><br />End of Edit.<br /><br />***************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Everything else I said in my original review still stands. But the above edit may help you decide if this is the right eye cream for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a natural, plant-based eye cream that is ultra-thick and rich, you'll find it in this 2 oz. jar.<br /><br />The jar will last a VERY long time, because you only need a tiny amount of this cream to cover the undereye area and the corners where crows feet form.<br /><br />I'd advise putting the cream on a couple of hours before bed, since it takes quite a while to absorb into the skin. (If you don't wait, you'll end up depositing most of the cream on your pillowcase.)<br /><br />I've also used a small amount of this cream on other areas of my face (nose to mouth lines) and the results were the same as around my eye area.<br /><br />So what were the results? The skin around my eye area looked smoother and brighter after one night of use.<br />The results on other parts of my face were less noticeable, but I believe continued use of the cream will improve the results in both the eye area and on the face.<br /><br />I'm rating the cream 4 stars instead of 5, because of one major issue I have with it, which is: THE SCENT.<br />The cream has a rather strong minty (?), menthol (?) medicinal smell that takes some time to fade away.<br />Since I prefer NO SCENT in eye/facial products, I deducted one star from my rating.<br /><br />That aside, if scented products don't bother you, and you want a thick, rich eye cream you will probably enjoy using this one.", "images": [], "asin": "B095VQX4DV", "parent_asin": "B095VQX4DV", "user_id": "AGDYFDP4Q23S6M3U2W3QS5KBDROQ", "timestamp": 1630241617771, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

It is vaguely floral, definitely a feminine scent. It smells wonderful in the shower, but I like the fact that it fades quickly once you rinse it away. It doesn't linger all day, meaning it won't compete with any other fragrance you are wearing.<br /><br />Second, I like the fact that this set is gentle, and non-drying. (Some other brands have left me with straw-like hair after a few uses.) This combo cleans gently, and leaves the hair feeling silky.<br /><br />Third, the toning is effective. There is a visible difference after just a couple of uses. I saw the yellow/orange tones had faded after the first use, and after the second, my hair was shiny and showed highlights, but there was a marked difference in the amount of brassiness.<br /><br />Fourth, I like the fact that the shampoo is natural (made with botanicals) and is sulfate and paraben free. It is also cruelty free, another big plus. The pump bottles are also great, making the shampoo and conditioner easy to use in the shower. They are plastic, so no breakage issues.<br /><br />Finally, the price is right. The shampoo and conditioner bottles each contain 16.9 fl. oz of product. A good buy.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a solid 5 star set.

The positive thing about electric shavers is that they are easy to use for quick touch ups and convenient shaves when you don't want to mess with water and creams and lotions.<br /><br />This Wahl shaver, in particular, is pretty nice. It shaves about as close as other electric shavers, which isn't as close as a manual razor, but with repeated use and going back and forth, it is better than no shave. Some type of pre-shave lotion, like Williams Lectric shave, helps a little.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty decent shaver. It charges fast and holds the charge for a long time. The top pops off easy to clean the blades. You can use the provided brush or just rinse it off with water. You can also use it in the shower or wet/dry shave.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Performance Just Like the Dentist Office BUT for ~ $140 on Sale now", "text": "We tried several home teeth whitening kits and most gave marginal results.  But this kit, performs just the same as what you get at the Dentist.  Look at the picture I posted.  Its the teeth color card. Out of 1 - 20, my wife started with 14 top and 11 bottom. She drank a lot of coffee, red wine, etc...We tried this kit and got her down to 4 top and 2 bottom. Her teeth are just as white as the dentist office whitening service.  Here is what separates this kit from others: 1) Performance is second to none, 2) You get most of the whitening results the first application which is 8 minutes.  Remember with this kit, you have to do 4 sets of 8 minutes per day.  Meaning a total of 32 minutes total per day.  Getting most of the whitening in the first 8 minutes is amazing results 3) It only takes 5 days and 2.5 vials total out of the 10 vials that comes with the kit.  Meaning she can maintain her whiteness for the next 4 months without spending more. The procedure costs ~$400 at the dentist. You pay ~$140 - $150 for this kit for the same fast results and can maintain it for 4 months, depending on your teeth.  Meaning out of all of the teeth whitening solutions available, this one ends up being the MOST COST EFFECTIVE with guaranteed results.  Meaning if your teeth were able to whiten before, you should get the same whitening again.  My teeth can't be whitened because how they developed before my permanent teeth came out. I had a high fever so my teeth are a little yellow as a result and can't be whitened much even at the dentist.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love the curls and price!", "text": "I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love the curls this bubble wand produces! I have stubborn, hard to hold curls kinda hair, but I curled my hair before bedtime and woke up still with nice curls! I went to work at the hospital and needless to say, it lasted my entire 8 hour shift without hair products/hair spray! Everyone loved it as they never see me with curly hair unless I\u2019m going out LoL The on my thing I don\u2019t care for is the stand for placing it down, as I had to keep flipping it up and down when I was curling my hair. One thing I can recommend is to section your hair and when curling, only curl a small section at a time because if you grab too much hair (I have a lot of hair and thick hair too), then it won\u2019t curl well. Another thing is, I can\u2019t guess how long to hold my hair on the wand before releasing so I\u2019m just guesstimating and pray I\u2019ve held it long enough to get the curl I want. I\u2019m too afraid of holding too long, damaging my hair. I purchased this item bc it was on sale for less than $19, saving me $20, so I figured I\u2019d give it a try. I also purchased a TYMO airflow flat iron/curler (on sale too) at the same time as this purchase and tested both products and since I love both, I\u2019m keeping both!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Norelco replaced my old Braun", "text": "I just got my first Norelco model 8825 XL, after 7 years using a Braun 4501. I considered these two brands the top in the electrical shaving industry. In some aspects I founded the Norelco reigning over the Braun and in other aspects the Braun is much better. So, the question you should ask yourself is what type of hair are you trying to shave?<br />Let first look at the Norelco series:<br />The different between the Norelco's Spectra (8000 series), Quadra (7000 series), Advantage (6000 series), and the Reflex (5000 series) is one major feature added to each series. The Reflex sports the basic &quot;Lift &amp; Cut&quot; system. The Advantage is the same but include a lotion dispenser. The Quadra's &quot;Lift and Cut&quot; system has two types of head with a slot and hole. The Spectra series has what the Quadra does, but include a comfort control. Both the Quadra and Spectra don't have lotion dispenser. There are also more special features that can be found in each series by looking at the 2nd digit. For example the Spectra 8894 have a digital screen where the bare-bone lower number Spectra 8825 have just a green light.<br />The performances, Norelco vs. Braun:<br />I have soft hair in the beard area and thicker hair around the lips (mustache and chin area). The Norelco does a superior job in the beard area; it cut it clean with a couple of strokes. When using the Braun (older model 4501), I sometime have to use a long trimmer and then go back over with the coil. The Norelco three individual heads move over the sides of the face a lot better. Braun does do a superior job over the mustache area. It coils has more and bigger holes then Norelco. The Spectra with it dual slot and hole head is good but takes longer time to cut down the thicker stub. The old Braun battery (NH-) is dying on me. Norelco battery (NiCd) is replaceable and you use it charged or just plug and play, which the Braun could not do. Overall, I prefer the Norelco's design.<br />The features I like:<br />I am still playing with the Personal Comfort Control and am not sure if it is necessary. The more sensitive the level is the long it takes to cut so far. The long hair trimmer is great, but that is almost standard in most models, but not the Advantage's Series. Plug and play is great, since I don't travel every day. Cleaning is simple; just rinse it in the sink. I like the solid construction the Norelco's design is, the rotating machine is fun to use and is very smooth.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006K0X1", "parent_asin": "B00006K0X1", "user_id": "AEJH3SYBWETZTZMWJSILGGAPMFOQ", "timestamp": 1075440467000, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing.", "text": "This product is very disappointing.  Initially I was excited to find a non-peel nail polish that was water based - I'm allergic to harsh chemicals, so traditional nail polish isn't an option.  I've used Suncoat peelable nail polish before and liked it a lot because it was completely odor free and did not cause any allergic reaction.  It did not last long on my nails, but I figured it was essentially meant for kids, so it's OK it if only lasts for a few hours.  I was only wearing it out for dinner, etc.  Then I've found out that Suncoat also makes water based polish that is non-peel.  I figured I would give it a try.  I've read multiple reviews stating that with proper application the product would last a few days on the nails.  2 or 3 days of wear are more than enough for me as I like to change my colors often.  Also, I understand that water based polish would never be as durable as the traditional polish, so I was perfectly OK to change it out every couple of days.  As soon as the product arrived I applied it as instructed. I did it shortly before bed time so that I wouldn't get my nails wet and allow the polish to cure.  By the time I woke up it had already chipped!  So, I reapplied and went to work.  By the time I got to work it was chipped again!  This was embarrassing; I spent good 20 minutes trying to scrap the polish off my nails.  Luckily, it came off easily.<br /><br />What's even more disappointing is that Suncoat customer service does not seem to care about customers.  I've contacted them asking if they had any helpful advice and so far received no response.", "images": [], "asin": "B016V28NQI", "parent_asin": "B016V28NQI", "user_id": "AESQKJ2QCIEUC6ZMW3ORCZINWJ5Q", "timestamp": 1459266139000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

We applied it 15 minutes before heading down to the beach and we were out in the sun for hours. Neither one of them burned.<br />I used it as well as my husband and it did its job very well. I even got a little tan but no burning. My husbands face burns very easily and this stuff protected him 100% and we only applied it once. I probably should of put it on my kids a few times in the amount of time we were there but I had left it in the hotel room. I am very pleased with this product. It doesn't smell strong at all and once on the skin it doesn't feel heavy and make you feel sticky. It soaks in nicely! The sand stuck to us a little but all we had to do was brush it off with our hand or towel and it fell right off. When others make the sand stick and stay on which is no good.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Thrilled with this mask!!", "text": "I love this product! It comes in a small container so I was kind of bummed at first, but what little product is in here packs a powerful punch.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a clay or mud type of mask to clarify and clear your skin. I suffer from deep cystic acne and broke out earlier this week. I put on this mud mask and I could not believe how great the results were. Within one day my pimples had disappeared and even my damage spots seem to be less noticeable.  My skin felt super soft and clear.<br /><br /> I have a pretty sensitive skin but I didn't have any irritation from this whatsoever. The package says to leave the mask on for 10 or 15 to 20 minutes but I noticed that even after 20 minutes, the mask still was not dried so I did leave it on for longer.  It is a bit of a drying mask so if you already have dry skin, you will want to use a moisturizer following the mask.  I found that when I combined it with my acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, it was just to drying for my skin. Therefore, I would recommend maybe skipping a day of other chemical products when you use this mask.<br /><br /> The mask it goes on really nice and smooth. I used a Q-tip to mix up the mask material as the directions say to stir it each time you're going to use it.  Then I just used the Q-tip to apply the mask and I from layer on my face.  The mask has a cooling a fact and isn't a dry or itchy at all. It was a very pleasant experience overall. It wasn't messy at all to use either.<br /><br /> I posted some pictures below of the material in the jar as well as when it was on my face.  That way, you can see how quickly I put the mask on my face.  I hope the photos are helpful.<br /><br /> Again, I recognize that this is a smaller container than I had previously thought, but you don't need much to cover your entire face. Although I can't say for sure, I am guessing that I would get at least 10 to 15 masks with this product. That is quite a bit considering how much is charged for mud mask facials at spas.  Do you make sure that you see all the container tightly and store it in a cool or dark place as it will dry out quickly if you leave it open.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MlV2Z84DL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MlV2Z84DL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MlV2Z84DL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iVIgISUjL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iVIgISUjL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iVIgISUjL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dQ59uIP3L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dQ59uIP3L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dQ59uIP3L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B00Q5V41NK", "parent_asin": "B00Q5V41NK", "user_id": "AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ", "timestamp": 1477161276000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "great set of hair clips--flexible hold and durable for styling", "text": "I LOVE these!!  I have recently gotten into dyeing my hair crazy unicorn colors and I've gotten sick of ruining my really expensive hair clips with all of the permanent dyes.  So I decided to invest in this 6-piece set of clips since I've seen my hair stylist use these when she is separating my hair into different pieces.<br /><br />Anyway, I have really long and thick hair.  So when I'm dyeing my hair, which I do at home, I really need to section the hair pieces off to make sure I get all of the strands saturated with color.  Otherwise, well, I'm not really into striped hair at the moment and uneven dye jobs that LOOK like I did it myself at home after drinking too much wine ;)<br /><br />I got the RED color because I have purple hair and wanted the clips to stand out.  I do not plan to wear these out of the house--they are only for my styling needs at home.  Otherwise, I would recommend getting a darker color because the plastic isn't super nice or stylish looking.  I like that these clips open easily and don't have a super strong grip.  Some of my clips are way too tight and I end up pulling my hair out or getting my hair stuck in the coils.  I like the more flexible feel of these and that they have more give, so I can move them around.  Even though they are flexible, they still hold the hair in place, but just do it less harshly, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I like the set of 6 because I tend to lose track of my clips and so this way, I will have a nice sized supply and won't always be running around my house searching for clips.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I hope you found my review helpful and that I provided enough detailed information so that you can determine whether or not this product is right for you and your lifestyle needs.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful rainbow set of glass nail files!", "text": "I've been wanting to try the glass nail files now for several years.  The cost of them was always a deterrent until I found this great 5 piece value set.<br /><br />I was so excited to get them and try them out. I was so tired of buying  nail files over and over again only to have them break or bend in my purse or just wear out after a month or two. I wanted to invest in something that would last a little bit longer even if it was more than the usual dollar store Emery boards I've become so frustrated with. It seems the cheap files I had been buying were constantly had to replace them.<br /><br />The nail files were shipped to me promptly and they are not only extremely functional, but beautiful. I ordered the rainbow set of 5 and they're soooo pretty.  My favorite is the emerald green one, which is so much more vibrant than it appears in the stock photo and In my crappy phone photo.  I love them. The set comes with a hard case to store them in. And the 5  files in their cases come in a larger zipped pouch!  they are the perfect size to throw in a purse, keep in my desk at work, stow in the console of my car, and store in my makeup bag while still having one extra in my medicine cabinet at home.  When you consider how much I spend on files for my nails and feet on a monthly basis, and I should never have to replace these --- they come with a lifetime guarantee. That is just crazy to me. I will be buying these for gifts for sure. I can\u2019t wait to tell everyone about them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion/review.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "The All Natural way to remove nail polish!", "text": "I'm puzzled by this product.  I loved the idea of having a natural, non-toxic nail polish remover.  I paint my own nails quite often, skipping the nail salon to save money and time.  I've been giving myself manicures and pedicures since 6th grade, so I'm pretty good at it (if I do say so myself) and am well-versed in many of the products out there.  I typically use a 100% acetone remover, which is AWESOME, but I hate that there are so many harmful chemicals, not only on my nails, but also in the fumes I'm breathing in every time I use it.  So, when I saw this product, I was excited and motivated to try it and like it.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was also pleased with the size.  I had assumed it would be pretty small because of the way the dropper looks next to it in the picture, but it's actually a good sized bottle.  Before using any product, I read the directions and particularly with a new type of product like this non-toxic, all-natural nail polish remover.  That's when I saw that you have to leave the product on the nail for 2-5 minutes.  I don't understand this because once you use the dropper to apply the product to the nail polish that's on the nail, it immediately starts dripping down the sides of the nails onto your hands and makes a bit of a mess.  It's also pretty inconvenient to sit there for 5 minutes when I could use my regular nail polish remover and would have clean nails in 30 seconds to a minute.  I decided instead to try pouring the product into a shallow bowl and soaking my nails in it instead.  This did make it much easier and created less of a mess, but it also requires you to use a lot more of the product than you would just using the dropper.<br /><br />I waited 2 minutes and took a cotton ball to swipe the nail to see if the polish would come off.  It started to, but just the top layer.  I re-soaked them in the product for 3 more minutes, and I was able to remove the polish from my nails.  I should also mention that I use Orly bonding base coat, which helps the polish adhere to the nail.  I also had 3 coats of polish, and a top coat, so that might be why the polish was so stubborn to come off.  Plus, it was a deep red, which is difficult to remove no matter what you are using, and it usually dyes my nail beds a bit when I'm removing the polish anyway.  As a positive, I did notice that this product was MUCH less harmful on my nails.  My acetone remover immediately dries out my nails and strips all the healthy oils from the nails and nail beds.  This did not do that.  My nails had a nice, healthy shine to them and the nail beds retained their moisture, which is nice.<br /><br />So, in summary, I love that this product is natural and non-toxic, but it's just not practical for me to spend 5 minutes soaking my nails to wait for the polish to come off.  However, if you are super green and more willing to commit to being patient in order to be able to use something that has no chemicals and is good for your body and those around you (which I commend you for!), then this is a great substitute for chemical nail polish removers.", "images": [], "asin": "B01AYTGWA8", "parent_asin": "B01AYTGWA8", "user_id": "AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ", "timestamp": 1459178224000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Then applied the conditioner which is more of a deep inky blue.  The instructions said to leave it in for a few minutes. When I wash it out, my hair feels differently--it feels as though there's still something there on my hair, but deeply mixed in. It feels differently than when I use regular shampoo.<br />Anyway, I love what this does for my hair. It seems to brighten the light silver and darken the darker grey.

The only way I could get solid pink eyelashes ended up with too much clumping. So it was possible to get solid pink eyelashes and I did, but then I had to gently wipe off all the excess mascara and that left me with pink tips.<br />Honestly, I liked it that way, I think it looks more subtle and not so obvious.

Each one has four suction cups on the back and they actually stick extremely well. It's a little tricky lining them all up so that these stay perfectly flat but it's doable. The colors of the bunnies are true to the product pictures so I disagree the green one could classify as mint. It's really more of a dark teal, but I still it.<br /><br />This set comes with four makeup sponges. I don't often use those so I'm no expert but these seem a little cheap to me as they came with some dents in them. I also didn't get the colors pictured and wasn't aware they would be random.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very happy with this razor", "text": "I am very impressed with this razor. I have used electric razors most of my 35+ years of shaving. I was skeptical using it for the first time, I thought it wasn't working because it is so soft to the face and so quiet. It didn't sound \"agressive\" like my other razors did. WRONG!!! The shave was close, my skin was not irritated at all, and it cut smooth basically in the first pass. This unit is first class.<br /><br />My previous razor was a Braun foil. I bought one for myself and another for my son from Frys because of the price. JUNK!!! We both have heavy beards, he more so than I, and both of us had terrible 5 o'clock shadows by 10:00AM! And the skin irritation on my neck, just horrible.<br /><br />I took a long time comparing all the available models. For me this model provides the best mix of features and price. I definitely recommend the Speed-XL shaving heads. Other nice features are it can be cleaned under the faucet, it charges quickly and maintains that charge for a long time, and it provides what I consider one of the best shaves I've had in a long time. The heft and feel is good. Materials are good. Workmanship is good. The only feature I'd like to have is a battery charge indicator.<br /><br />The other Speed-XL model is the 8160. It includes the cleaning system with a much higher price. Now there is the SmartTouch-XL which may be overkill. But if price is not an issue...<br /><br />May, 2012 - I can't believe I wrote the original review almost seven years ago. I'm still using this razor and it still works just as I expressed back then. The battery still keeps a great charge, and the shave is still excellant. I went on a 10 day vacation last year and the charge held for the whole trip.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Really nice spray bottle", "text": "Really nice spray bottle. I have three of these and I keep alcohol in them for sanitizing. The trigger sprayer is easy on my hand the size is great and I am going to make a label one day if it kills me with my old LabelMaker that says alcohol. I use isopropyl alcohol for everything. Before Covid when my husband will go to sleep I would spray the whole floor the door knobs, and the chairs. I didn\u2019t want him to get sick. And he didn\u2019t and neither did I. I think preventative spraying with alcohol is a good way to not get sick. If you have a nice spray bottle you can spray the floor in the bathroom, the kitchen floor, the door knobs, and you can wash the surface with a glass covering like my kitchen table. It\u2019s hard to find a good spray bottle and these work well plus they\u2019re very very pretty. They\u2019re a blue green. Very cheery and well-made. If you get about 3 You will always know alcohol and you won\u2019t even have to label them. You can have them in different parts of your house. That will be your visual go to alcohol station. I color coordinate everything. I read books on neuroscience and the more organized you are the less your brain stresses. So when I see green I know it\u2019s a big fat spray bottle with alcohol. I buy alcohol by the gallon and just fill them.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc83Retire that old blow dryer and brush\ud83d\udc95", "text": "WOW!! When I first recieved this I was really intimidated. Its HUGE! I was worried about even being able to use it. But I'm always up for a challenge.<br />First let me say I have fine but thick hair and shoulder length. Normally I use a blow dryer and a circular brush to give myself some volume.<br />This unit comes with 2 brushes, one for shorter hair,one for longer. The brushes have nice soft bristles that won't rip at your hair. So if you do get a tangle it slides right out. I used the shorter brush myself.<br />At first it was difficult for me to use because of a bad shoulder. The size was an issue for me. But with a little practice I got the hang of it. Realizing that it actually takes the place of 2 tools. The blow dryer and circular brush all in one ( still old school I guess \ud83d\ude43)  And in the long run I found it easier on my bad shoulder because I had to use only one tool instead of two! \ud83d\udc83<br />I also takes some real practice to use the rolling feature. If there was anything I would change, that would be it. There is one for this. And it's very easy to accidentally go the wrong way (\ud83d\ude1c believe me not a good look)<br />Once I figured out to just roll it enough to get the hair on and let go of the button, hold it for a moment while the dryer works then pull it through. And WOW it gives you such volume that lasts all day. Leaves your soft and silky too. I'm so impressed!<br />I immediately made the room for this new tool in my bathroom.<br />I would highly recommend it. It's a little intimidating.. So worth the challenge tho!<br />I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried it... You should too!
