For the silver, I went all the way up in my hair, and for the green, I kept the top third of my hair undone. The color shows remarkably well in my hair! It can be brushed once the wax dries for a softer, less stringy look, but you do lose some of the color.<br /><br />I definitely don\u2019t recommend wearing white when you have this wax in your hair, the white collar on my jacket went bright green. Also, be prepared that this is going to flake off all throughout the day. If you have shorter hair, it might not be as noticeable, but when your hair goes past your hips, you will get flakes all over your clothes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product to temporarily change your hair color without having to bleach your hair first.

Unless you have a BIO IONIC dryer you run the risk that this item will not fit your dryer.<br /><br />When I finally found a dryer that worked with this diffuser, the diffuser worked well.  This diffuser is very well made compared to the diffusers that come with most dryers.  First, it's larger than typical diffusers.  Second, it swivels to open and close the air vents.  I find that it's best used when my hair is nearly dry to put the finishing touches on.  I was a bit skeptical of what a diffuser would offer at this price point, but I think the build quality warrants the price.<br /><br />Overall, I proceed with caution when ordering this product unless you have the BIO IONIC.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Pretty amazing...", "text": "I've been using this razor since it arrived, approximately 2 weeks ago, and thinking long and hard about the score I'd give it.  I actually intended to give it 4/5, the reason being that, while it's an excellent razor, the price point is rather high.  In the end, though, I'm so impressed that I really need to give it a full five stars in spite of the price, with the caveat that you may want to take a look at one of the less expensive, stripped-down models; this one is the flagship, but all the models should be similarly excellent (please bear in mind this is the only one I've used).<br /><br />And excellent it is.  While my feelings have already been summed up in the opening paragraph, read on for similarly styled (but moderate) hyperbole.<br /><br />I've never gotten such a good shave with an electric razor.  Norelco does recommend that you give the razor a full 21 days of your time exclusively (i.e. not shaving with anything else) before making a judgment.  I haven't had the luxury of giving it a full 21 days, as I need to get my review in; however, I've already adjusted to it so well that I can't imagine going back to my old razors.  It will only get better as I get more used to it, although I'm perfectly satisfied at this point and unsure if it could get any better.<br /><br />Not only do I use it to shave my face (which is obviously what it was designed for, and it does a great job), I use it to shave my head.  It's not going to give you as close a shave as a traditional razor, but it's also not going to scrape against your skin like a traditional razor.  You'll also save money on shaving cream (the only extra expense is buying a new razor \"head\" for it yearly, the price of which I am uninformed of).  It works \"dry\".  This is nice for me, as it takes a lot of cream to shave both my face and my scalp, and it does, in fact, do a decent job on my head.  It's a little stubbly, even right after shaving, but honestly the only thing that would do a better job would be a blade, and that's a difficult way to shave (I was previously using a Headblade).  If it can shave a head, where my hair was very thick, I imagine it would be adequate for even the bushiest of beards, and, again, it's designed for faces, not heads.<br /><br />If you look at the features list, you'll see that this model is full of bells and whistles.  Truthfully, they are mostly extras you could live without; the lower-end models would likely be just fine, so I strongly suggest examining them as a money-saving alternative.  The meter that shows you how many minutes of the charge are remaining is sort of handy, the icon that lights to remind you to clean it is somewhat useful, but to say they're necessary would be a grave overstatement.  In fact, the \"wash me\" icon lights up after basically every use, so its necessity is particularly dubious.  (As a side note, it's marvelously easy to clean.)<br /><br />In the end, the product does receive my highest recommendation.  I think if you tried it out, you'd be pleased, and even if you had to send it back and didn't like it after three weeks via their guarantee (it does take time for your skin to adjust), there would be little time/money wasted.  I would, however, encourage you to check out the lower-end models.  Ultimately, even the high price point wasn't enough for me to downgrade to four stars.  I'm normally quite critical.", "images": [], "asin": "B000PKKAGO", "parent_asin": "B000PKKAGO", "user_id": "AEQJ7JR2SJGHQZIGO72D7RO7OVWA", "timestamp": 1197475411000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Like the way it makes my natural & nappy hair feel", "text": "This has the very, very *very* faintest plant-like scent (which is clean and pleasing). It's also thicker than I expected - almost like a whipped lotion. Before I used it on my hair, I rubbed some into the back of my hand to see if I'd have any kind of skin reaction. I did not. What I noticed is that once this absorbed, there was absolutely zero residue. I don't know what that means, but I was just curious. When I rub in other types of hair masks & treatments, I always get a sense of something left that I need to wash off. When I used this on my hair in the shower, I left it on for about<br />2 to 3 minutes after I had massaged it in according to the directions. (I have to stop and mention that I was also using the Daelong shampoo and conditioner set beforehand. That might be why I got my results.) This rinses out extremely well. My hair felt conditioned but with a lot less of the residual slip from other conditioners. That kind of worried me. I like to know that a treatment is doing something & the only way to tell until you've used it for a while is by the way your hair feels. Where I became so happy with this is an hour after rinsing it out. I have coarse and &#34;nappy&#34; natural African American hair. My hair tends to be extremely dry - especially after washing. A good conditioner keeps things in check until I can apply my leave-in products (oils, butters, sprays, etc.), but this time, my hair stayed soft and easy to comb through for at least 2 hours. It might have been longer, but I went ahead and applied my usual leave-ins. Still, I know that this did soften my hair (the day after, my hair is retaining softness without any more leave-in applications) without making it feel fragile. With they type of hair I have, I have to worry about breakage. I realize that I have probably been clogging up my scalp by over-doing it with the oils and butters. I like that I haven't had to use more of them for my hair to feel manageable. As a test, I'm going to try easing up on using so much leave-in stuff while I continue to use this.I think these guys are on to something here. I will have to come back and update this review as I use this for a while but, for now, I love the way this makes my hair feel, even after just one treatment. Normally, I only fully wash my hair once every four weeks or so. I will do a co-wash about every other week to keep it clean without stripping it. While I am testing this out, I plan to use it at least once a week as my co-wash. Like I said, I am also using the shampoo & conditioner of this brand. That might be a big part of why this worked so well for me, but I think that this would work just as good on its own. By the way, I'm going to alter my washing regimen for a while to use the shampoo and conditioner at least every other week. I almost forgot to mention the other thing I was concerned about: the label says that this makes the hair &#34;straight and silky&#34; - which is exactly what I, personally, DO NOT want. I love my texture and want to keep it. My texture is the kind that is prone to slow growth (because of breakage) so... I'm not worried about losing my naps. I'm thinking that this aids in stopping breakage more than anything.<br />I got this at a very steep discount.", "images": [], "asin": "B01ESTMN94", "parent_asin": "B01ESTMN94", "user_id": "AHE6A2KMCMQSOHCMNE7JQHSAHTRQ", "timestamp": 1463540578000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great item, but there are more affordable alternatives", "text": "This works and works well. The reason I can't give it a full  5-star review is because of the price. There is a very similar product that is way cheaper and works as well or better than this one. I found Sole Magic online for about a dollar cheaper than this one. In superstores and drug stores, I found it for a couple of bucks. This one does work and I can't say one negative thing about it - other than the price. When a pedicure is around $20 (even here in Alaska where prices are high), and I can do upkeep with a similar foot smoothing pad for about $2, I just can't see paying almost $9 for this one. If other customers do want this one, I can tell you that it works, the shape is nice and makes it easy to grip and use with either hand. It's also nice that their is a coarse side and a finer side. One thing that I disagree with is that you could use this anywhere but on your feet. I don't know what would have to be going on with anyone's elbows or knees for them to use this on!

This saves on product and keeps me from spilling any from the tube. Like I said, this has a very &#34;wet&#34; texture, so you won't have to use much. The price is way up there but, compared to using a lot of a cheaper product (that doesn't work as well), or a same-priced product (but using more of it), this is the best value overall.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Pricey, But Worth It To Have a GOOD Charger", "text": "I own a Galaxy S6 Edge Plus... AND an iPhone 6 (Work Phone), AND a Galaxy Tab4 10.1, AND a New Trent Battery 12,000 mAh Pack.  With that said, each one of these devices is using it's own charger and because of that, I had to resort using a power strip by my bedside JUST to charge all my devices.<br /><br />The current chargers I use are all stock (1 Apple Charger, 3 Samsung Chargers).  One of the Samsung Chargers is directly from the S6 Edge Plus (supports Adaptive Fast Charging/Quick Charge 2.0), yet it fails to work 80% of the time on my S6 Edge Plus for whatever reason...<br /><br />Another issue is when I go away for overnight trips somewhere.  For a day, I could probably just get by with just the iPhone charger & Samsung charger, but when I have 3-4 night stays due to work, I have to pack all of them!!!  It's just a big hassle.  That's when I decided I'm just going to resort to buying a GOOD multi-port charger.  I've used Ankur devices in the past and I've been very pleased with all of them.  After reading various reviews, I decided the 3-port is perfect for my situation.<br /><br />For $25, you get a 3-port charger: 2 PowerIQ ports and 1 Quick Charge 2.0 port (which the Edge+ takes advantage of).<br /><br />I've used the Ankur PowerIQ tech before via an Ankur Car Charger and I can definitely say it's almost as good as the Quick Charge 2.0 technology.  What I like about it is that it supposedly &#34;detects&#34; what kind of device is connected to it and charges accordingly.  Whether this is true or snake oil, I can say that it charges my devices fast and never has any kind of power dip when you have multiple devices connected to it.  I use these two ports for my iPhone, Galaxy Tab4 and New Trent Battery pack.<br /><br />The single Quick Charge is dedicated to my Galaxy S6 phone and right out of the box (same cables and all), it would fast charge my phone 100% of the time.  Unlike my old stock Quick Charge Charger, it never seemed to work.  So when I'm charging my phone and seeing it will fully charge within an hour makes me happy!<br /><br />The only initial turnoff is the $25 sticker price.  Yes you get a multi-port charger, but I think maybe that sticker price will scare some people.  But after experiencing and using this product, I think that $25 is DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  Never have a poor quality/flaky charger again.  I'm 100% pleased with this item!", "images": [], "asin": "B017JSZKGY", "parent_asin": "B017JSZKGY", "user_id": "AHOOD7DBLBIUO6DB7DZMCWYBZS3Q", "timestamp": 1461089562000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Overall Pleased!", "text": "I purchased this unit on a Prime Day.  Reviews were mixed, but I was willing to take a chance at the sale price.  Very happy I did.  It looks a little less than 150% when flat ironed, but I like it that way because it looks more realistic.  Having too much hair makes it look wiggy.<br /><br />I immediately washed it, let it dry naturally, then flat ironed it.  I'm more of a straight hair girl.  The hair is very soft and took to straightening well.<br /><br />I didn't experience much shedding; a strand here and there.  It's only been a week and 1 wash, so we'll see.  Some shedding is always to be expected eventually though with any wig; just not crazy shedding.  I also haven't experienced any tangling.  I'm always looking for that, especially at the nape area, and it has been hot.  So the wig is winning there.<br /><br />The knots are slightly bleached.  I just added a little foundation powder and it worked well.  Best part is that the hairline was plucked to perfection.

So I am not a verified buyer, as it was gifted.<br /><br />If one read directions and you don\u2019t apply it like regular shampoo, it must be applied at the scalp directly first then run down the strands, this is probably why some people complain about greasy hair, they probably didnt part their hair and apply at scalp.<br /><br />My Tip for using this product, is to be sure you apply at scalp. I applied before getting in the shower at the mirror, to save water, and parted my hair at finger width intervals, wetting the bar as I went, rubbing it my scalp,  before showering, took less than 10 minutes, then once in shower I wet my hair a little bit, and it really lathered up.<br /><br />When I rinsed my hair, I could tell it was clean, felt different from bottle shampoo. You could feel the clean. It felt lighter than usual too..<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars, but I dont like the peppermint scent, but then I don\u2019t like food scents in my toiletry products.

It took a lot of work.  Everyone I knew kept an extra dry brush for thinning clumps and distributing the mascara evenly.  Later, I kept an old empty mascara tube/brush for brushing lashes and evening out mascara applications.  These work SO much better!  Lashes are much longer and not clumpy with these wonderful brushes.  Also great for using after applying false eyelashes for blending/interspersing the false lashes with your own.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Organized all my daily wear makeup into on easy to use area.", "text": "This acrylic makeup organizer by MelodySusie is part of my ongoing effort to get myself more organized. Until recently my makeup was an absolutely disaster. I finally got sick of that and decided something needed to be done, so after gathering everything up (and culling a huge amount that I just do not use any more) I started sorting and putting things into this organizer. With several drawers and compartments it was easy to arrange everything in a compact space so I could still see everything. I also really liked the flexibility that this organizer offers. I currently have the dividers in place in the bottom drawer since I am using it to keep my most often worn pairs of earrings easily accessible, but if I were to ever get more makeup I could remove the dividers and use the drawer as it, and setthe divider on the counter on its own to hold additional items.<br /><br />The organizer itself seems to be well made - nice and sturdy with parts that fit together well and are well finished so there are no rough jagged edges. The included drawer liners are a nice touch and they help to keep things from rolling or rattling around each time I open and close a drawer. I like that the top section is a separate unit that can be removed as this makes cleaning much easier. I wear powdered foundation (that famous brand that you swirl and tap) and particles of it seem to get into everything. With a removable top tray, when it needs a deep cleaning I can just remove all my makeup from it and rinse it under the faucet without messing up the items that are in the drawers. That's not possible to do with an all in one unit where the top tray is attached to the base drawers.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy wih this organizer. It works very well for my makeup, though I can also see it working well for other uses. As an artist I can see it working very well in my studio to organize art supplies as well.<br /><br />I did receive this item at no cost for the purposes of testing and review.

For someone not used to them, they can seem a bit strange. Maybe it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I really enjoy the chewy leathery texture of them as well.  Something I discovered with these years ago is to spread them in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and stick them under the broiler for just a few minutes.. no more than it takes for them to just barely start to get a hint of brown. The texture completely changes to something crispy instead of chewy. Watch it though, they go from brown to black in the blink of an eye! Toasted up this way they also make for an unusual topping to a salad or a bowl of noodle soup.<br /><br />The original while package taro are my favorites, flavor wise, though sometimes I like the yellow and orange package ones too - they tend to be spicier, which I have to be in the mood for.", "images": [], "asin": "B00E4E269Q", "parent_asin": "B00E4E269Q", "user_id": "AHF57VHYENVKYRF2B66VJSRPJ6RQ", "timestamp": 1454815328000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

May be lightening tear stains too--will update review.", "text": "This is an interesting way to market a Konjac Sponge, i.e. for your pets. I have to say though, it's pretty brilliant. I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it can remove tear stains, but given how hard they are to get rid of I somehow doubt it. I'll update the review if it works well over time though!<br /><br />Please note I most likely purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. In order to save time, I do as much of my shopping online as is humanly possible. I rely heavily on other customers reviews when making purchasing decisions, so as such, I take the honest and unbiased bit very seriously.

They either broke me out, or didn't secure on my face right, or they just didn't do anything for my face at all. This is the first sheet mask where I actually felt my face responding to it in a good way. It smelled just like citrus without it being too overpowering, nor was the tingly sensation, it told me that it was working! I also liked how this wasn't dripping with ampoule, it had the perfect amount to soak the face without it making a mess on your countertop or where the stuff would be rolling down your face and to your chest or creeping towards your eyes. So that in turn made wearing this more relaxing and not so irritating and awkward like most if not all the other sheet masks I tried. I almost didn't want to remove it, that's how much I enjoyed and loved it! I couldn't believe how baby soft smooth my skin was after using it. It wasn't a life-changer or game-changer for my hyperpigmentation, but it's unrealistic and next to impossible for any product to do that after only one use. My skin loved this though, I can tell that this is perfect for my skin type (combination/oily acne prone skin). I thought I'd swore off sheet masks. Granted, I'm still not blown away by sheet masks in general, this mask hasn't made me a fan of them, BUT...I'd totally buy this again.

I became intrigued after reading about the many benefits of Moringa oil so I decided it might be worth trying. I ordered from Inn & Co because their Moringa oil is 100 % organic. Also because I am always on the look out for value and good prices, and this Moringa oil comes in a good sized bottle about 4 inches tall which holds 4 fluid ounces of oil. That is a good size as a lot of oils come in much smaller bottles and cost just as much. So Moringa oil is filled with antioxidants and phytonutrients along with supposedly reducing wrinkles and sagging fatigued skin. It also boasts anti inflammatory benefits. So here I am to report that the oil, along with being a delight to smell, is refreshing, relaxing, and hydrating to my face and hands. No, my wrinkles have not wondrously disappeared but I can report that my dry skin on my face is being diminished. As for my hands a little bit of the Moringa oil rubbed in both of my hands leaves them feeling so luxuriously hydrated I just want to hold hands with everybody! I'm really enjoying this oil.

The price is actually pretty good for what you get.  A little goes a long way.  I haven't been using this very long, but I have already noticed a difference in my hair shedding in the shower. Both have a good scent without being too overpowering. These actually leave my hair feeling and looking healthier. My hair has started to thin out and I wanted to stop it before it got too bad. It really leaves my hair feeling clean and restored. I do wash my hair daily with this shampoo and conditioner, but the bottle has lasted a long time. I put the shampoo on my wet hair in the shower and massage into my scalp, leave on for a minute, and then wash out with the warm shower water.  I then do the same with the conditioner.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent hand cream", "text": "UPDATE - 09/30/16 ========================================<br />Still loving this moisturizer and just ordered another package. This stuff goes on well, absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling! My skin feels truly moisturized. I love using it on my hands and feet before bedtime, this way it really absorbs into my skin overnight.<br />Love it, love it, love it!<br /><br />========================================================<br />Not many people know this, or give it another thought sometimes - anything you put on your skin gets absorbed through the skin and ends up in the blood stream. This is why I am rather careful when picking my skin care products. I have been staying away from most hand creams for a while now just because for the most part there's at least a few potential carcinogens lurking among the ingredients.  Even though the big famous brand creams make your skin feel wonderful the question is if the trade off is worth it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even so called organic products aren't always that safe. Provided, manufacturers of this goodness are disclosing all the ingredients on the label (and not hiding anything) this cream looks safe enough to eat. Therefore, I have been happily slathering it all over my hands (and any other body parts needing additional moisture) in the past few weeks and I am quite pleased with the results.<br /><br />This white fluffy goodness feels surprisingly light and absorbs quickly into the skin. I must admit, it is a tad thinner in texture than I had expected but on the other hand this lightness ensures there's no oily residue left on your hands. The cream has no scent whatsoever which is a definite positive for those who are sensitive or don't particularly appreciate scented products. I'm adding a drop of essential oil of my choice (whatever I feel like that day) when I apply the cream if I feel like smelling something nice. Basically this cream is your blank canvas and leaves much room for creativity.<br /><br />One thing I would probably change about this product is the packaging. (At least maybe as an option for buyers to choose from) I really think that tubes are better for hand creams - way easier to dispense and so much more hygienic (sticking your fingers into the container doesn't really help keep it germ free).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Decent for it's price point.", "text": "[[VIDEOID:5e37579b01c9e26d7c0d83a26f8153a7]] *as a licensed cosmetologist, I'm reviewing this item from a personal as well as professional standpoint*<br /><br />I am almost 30 years old, and still suffer from breakouts. I have seen dermatologist and tried a lot of things but they often dry out my skin too much, causing my skin to produce MORE sebum (oil) combining with the  medicines side effect of dry dead skin sells. This is a fast way to disaster skin-wise and often causes my skin to worsen. Because of this, I have tried many different facial cleansing devices, and here are the points that I like about this one.<br /><br />1) Rechargable! Nothing is worse than needing to use a facial scrubber only to find that the batteries are dead. I cannot tell you how many times that the batteries have died (in other models) and then to make it worse, I often discover a mess of rust when I open up the compartment to change the batteries. The fact that this unit can be easily charged through a micro USB is not only convenient but also costs less and is safer.<br /><br />2) Variety- all the different attachments that come with this unit is a nice little bonus. I can't genuinely say that I would use all of them (remember, trained in skin Haha) but as a consumer I still appreciate the additional options.<br /><br />3) Quality- at this price point, it's surprisingly well made. I was a little concerned with the rubber cap that protects the USB port, but other than that, it's sturdy. The plastic does not flex at all, and it feels solid.<br /><br />4) Sound- I never thought that something like sound would bother me, but I definitely noticed how quiet this unit is compared to other models I've owned. I have two small children, so I'd often have to go to a bathroom further away from their bedrooms to cleanse my face at night, but with the noise level of this cleaner, i'm just genuinely not concerned with waking them.<br /><br />The only 'con' that I've found personally is the speed of rotation vs the softness of the bristles. I feel like it would be more productive to either have the head rotate faster or have harder bristles. Having said that, skin is very thin, especially when it's sensitive like mine. I DO prefer the softer bristles, because they are much kinder to my skin and I don't have to worry about causing more damage to inflamed areas. However, the brush's rotation was just too slow for me, (please see my review video for a short view of the rotation)  and I felt impatient at how long it took to get a thorough round of cleansing and sloughing to my face. Because of this, I cannot rate at 5 stars because it's just simply not as good as it could be. But, all things considered it's still a good sturdy competitor at its price point in today's market.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Results In 1 Week - See Before & After Pics", "text": "[[VIDEOID:f2b369e0d51ead5b1e259f05074a0f65]] I was actually shocked when I looked at the pictures I took of my face of &quot;before&quot; and 7 days &quot;after&quot; using this miracle massage tool. I have been using this tool once per day at night for 7 days (I missed 1 day out of the 7 days) in combination with my normal nightly face routine. Prior to using the face tool, I apply a liberal amount of my eye cream so that there is still some that is not completely rubbed into my skin (the instructions recommend using an eye gel or similar product). I then use the wider, blunted tip on the tool and slowly move the tip around my face and pause in each area for about 5-10 seconds per the instruction manual.<br /><br />The tool itself is about 6.5&quot; long and feels like a wide marker when held in your hand. It is powered by 1 AAA battery (not included) and has a power button with 2 intensity levels. When turned on, the tool emits bionic waves via the tool's tip when it makes contact with your skin (see demonstration in video). The lower wave intensity is supposed to be used for slight to moderate wrinkle reduction and the higher intensity is meant for deeper wrinkles. However, during my testing, I used the higher intensity level exclusively (all of my wrinkles looked deep to me lol). The instructions state that the tool can be used up to twice per day (with at least 6hrs between each treatment time) and should be used on clean skin. Treatments do not cause any pain/discomfort and do not leave any marks or redness on your face.<br /><br />This wrinkle eraser is incredibly easy to use, though does take some time dedication if you follow the recommended 5-10sec per skin surface area. I have already begun to see results (thanks to remembering to take &quot;before&quot; pictures) and will 110% continue to use this tool indefinitely. Now that I know the tool works, I'm going to start using the smaller tip on the wrinkles just under my lash lines in addition to using the broader tip around my eyes. I am looking forward to seeing more results, and I would highly recommend this product to others.<br /><br />*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Simple to Use & Perfect Results Every Time!!", "text": "I LOVE these bun makers!! I have an old bun maker that I've been using for years, but that one just got tossed in the trash because these new ones are SO much easier to use and the finished product looks much better!! These bun makers are unique in that they are foam, which helps to grip your hair to better hold it in place. They also have a very strong inner wire that holds them in place in a perfect circle. I have relatively long (just past my bust line) hair with long layers - the trick to getting all of the end pieces of the layers to stay tucked in place is to pull the bun maker down the length of your ponytail just before you reach the end of the shortest layer. Then, fold all of the rest of the ends upward over the hair piece and tuck them inward towards the center of the ponytail. As you roll the hair piece upwards, continue to tuck any loose ends in so that they are held in place by the rolled hair. The other trick to getting a perfectly round bun is that once you have rolled the hair piece all the way up with your hair, fold the ends inward towards each other to form a circle, but make sure to tighten this circle as much as possible by pushing the ends as close together as you can. Otherwise, these hair pieces are fairly self-explanatory to use, and there are step-by-step instructions included with each of the four bun maker pieces. In addition to these four pieces, this product also includes 2 sets of 8 bobby pins -- 1 set is about 2&quot; long each and the other set is about 3&quot; long.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R1-wdtCBL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R1-wdtCBL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R1-wdtCBL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-EQLdyHL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-EQLdyHL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-EQLdyHL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n0pOWhcFL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n0pOWhcFL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n0pOWhcFL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u0Snoe-0L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u0Snoe-0L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u0Snoe-0L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B014SRAOVK", "parent_asin": "B014SRAOVK", "user_id": "AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ", "timestamp": 1462780853000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works for Eye Puffiness & Amazing Off-Label Headache Relief!!", "text": "This eye cream was far different than I was expecting -- but in a GREAT way. I'm 29-years-old, so the lines around my eyes aren't terribly deep, although they are probably deeper than many other females my age due to my sun-worshiping in earlier years. I do suffer, however, from severe seasonal allergies and am constantly plagued with dark circles (&#34;allergic shiners&#34; as they call them) and extreme puffiness of both my upper eyelids and just under my eyes (the infamous &#34;bags&#34;).<br /><br />To be honest, my impression of this cream at first glance wasn't too great. For starters, the jar of cream was much smaller than I had imagined, but I guess that's my fault for not noticing the (very) small-printed &#34;0.5 fl oz&#34; on the label in the picture. (I do think that this was a little deceitful though, because the size/amount of this cream is not listed anywhere on the product description.) In addition, while trying to read the teeny tiny print on the jar, I also almost immediately noticed a spelling typo on the front of the label that reads &#34;Nautral & Healthy&#34; rather than &#34;Natural & Healthy.&#34; I know this seems like a rather minuscule and knit-picky detail to point out, but it did make me at least wonder about this company's quality control standards.<br /><br />Despite my initial impression, I gave the company/cream the benefit of the doubt and have been using it for the last few days. With my first application under my eyes, the cream felt more on the &#34;thin&#34; side (similar to a lotion rather than thick cream), but while rubbing the cream into my skin in a circular motion, the moisture that the cream delivered was far better than I anticipated. It takes at least 3-4 minutes before your skin feels like the cream is completely absorbed, which gave me ample time to slowly massage the area during absorption (and felt very soothing and relaxing). I had absolutely no issues with any side effects or skin reactions such as burning, tingling, redness, or irritation. I noticed a small &#34;immediate&#34; reduction in the pores and fine lines of the areas I applied the cream, though not as impressive as some of the Retinol and Vitamin C serums that I've used in the past. There was no obvious difference in the dark circles or puffiness right after application, however, within about 30-45min, the puffiness started to visibly decrease and the area all around my eyes felt less tender/achy in general.<br /><br />With each subsequent application, I noticed the same resulting decrease in puffiness as was observed initially. My puffiness did return each morning, but I expected because I'm still constantly being exposed to my allergens. (After all, the cream is meant to relieve a symptom of my allergies, not be a miracle cure for my chronic systemic condition.) I've noticed that if I apply the cream immediately before bed and spend more time rubbing it into my skin in the circular motions, I do have a noticeable decrease in the morning when I wake up compared to before I started using the cream. As far as the under-eye dark circles, I can't tell a difference so far - but in all fairness, I've only been using the cream for 4 days (twice daily) so there's still hope.<br /><br />Now for the best part (in my opinion, at least). On the second night of using this cream, I had yet another one of my throbbing headaches (allergies are the worst!!) About 15-20min after my evening cream application, I noticed that my headache felt a little better -- I'm not saying that there was some miraculous change here, but it did feel less severe. This was very unusual for me, as I hadn't taken any ibuprofen or Zyrtec at that point (my usual go-to medications when my headaches are severe). The only thing I could think that I had done differently this time than any other time was that I applied the cream -- it was a strange connection, but stranger things have certainly happened to me. I went back to look at the ingredients listed on the jar and saw that it had rooibos in it. I had absolutely no idea what this was (and probably didn't notice it the first time I looked because I don't have a magnifying glass), but I looked it up online and read that it's an herb from South Africa with a laundry-list of health benefits -- including antioxidant properties and... headache relief?!?! Although still relatively skeptical that this was just a coincidence and that I had gotten &#34;lucky&#34; on my google search, I was still optimistic and proceeded to rub the eye cream on my temples and at the base of my skull to see what would happen. After a good 30-45min, my headache was almost completely gone. I know this headache thing sounds ridiculous and obscure, but I encourage anyone to research this mysterious Rooibos for themselves. I haven't had a headache as severe as that one since, but I have had a few headaches start to come on, and with each headache, I applied the cream to my temples, under my eyes, and to the base of my skull and the feeling has gone away each time within about an hour.<br /><br />With all of this said, I couldn't rate this &#34;eye&#34; cream turned headache remedy anything less than 5 stars despite my initial less-than-thrilled first impression. Because the cream is light and only requires a very small amount with each application, I think the small jar will actually last me a reasonably long time, too. Between the headache relief and the disappearing eye bags, I would be confident in recommending this product to others. I was also fortunate to receive my first jar of this cream at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OTfGMIsrL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OTfGMIsrL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OTfGMIsrL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B01C2M3VIQ", "parent_asin": "B01C2M3VIQ", "user_id": "AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ", "timestamp": 1457502402000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

Overall, it works well and it just small enough to squeeze between the two drawers that come up on either side of my vanity. I have a love/hate feeling for the little raised &#34;dots&#34; that cover each side of the mat. I like them because they raise the hot tool when resting on the mat to give extra heat protection to my vanity top underneath it. However, I also put my makeup on at my vanity and because of the silicone surface, every little drop of makeup powder is attracted to and clings to the silicone mat surface. The silicone isn't that difficult to clean (I use either pledge spray or a lysol wipe), but the little raised dots make it difficult to get into all the little grooves in order to get the mat perfectly clean. I could move the mat while I put my makeup on, but I don't have many places to put it on where I get ready, so this would be a huge inconvenience. Plus, regardless of where i put the mat, it will still collect dust overtime and have the same cleaning issue.<br />As a solution to cleaning the mat, I started running it under warm water and using a dish brush with bristles to scrub the mat and get in those difficult grooves, which has been successful as far as perfectly cleaning the mat - it's just a little more tedious than I'd like it to be.", "images": [], "asin": "B00A0RUGPM", "parent_asin": "B00A0RUGPM", "user_id": "AFUT2GCF5TIZDVYRT2IACBMJYSLQ", "timestamp": 1455521957000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "natural remover that actually works.. yes it's true!", "text": "So when you hear &#34;natural&#34; nail polish remover what comes to mind? For me I thought &#34;there is no way this is going to work&#34;. So what do I do I order it anyways because hey I love the earth, but I want to be pretty too. I've had this stuff for like a week already and even though my toes look like they have been through war I still just keep staring at it. Well today I finally decide to take the plunge. I read all of the instructions and see that you have to let it &#34;sit&#34; on your nails for 2-5 minutes. It's very difficult for me to stay still that long, so I figure I'll try it out and see what happens. Mind you I am not trying this on any regular nail polish, no. I have the polish from my last pedicure which is a light pink glitter polish AKA the worst type of polish to try to remove. I feel like I'm setting this stuff up to fail, right. So I grab the dropper and fill it up. I place a few drops on each toe (for those of you keeping track this is a watery formula and will not stay well if you move at all). I did keep moving about my business for 5-6 minutes. I then return with some cotton pads. I wipe the big toe not expecting much and almost the entire polish wipes away in one swipe. I kid you not more than 3/4 of the polish was gone in one swipe. I'm in disbelief at this point, so I stare and pick at it like it's going to talk to me. After a few minutes in awe I finish the rest of my toes. I did have to go back and do it one more time because my toes are very curved and like I said I cannot sit still, however it didn't bother me at all. This stuff removed disgusting glitter polish in less time and less smell than any other product I've ever used. I am so impressed that I keep staring at the pad I used to remove the polish. It's like it just melted it into a sheet and it just slides off of my nail. It's really cool. I am impressed also that I do not need a ton of this stuff to remove all the polish for my toes so I'm thinking it will last a while. I will re-order this stuff once mine runs out. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wears nail polish ever. I do need to mention that I did receive this product for free to review.

These are wide and I like to fold them over to double up the protection, but I do like the flexibility to make the band the right size for what I am wearing.<br /><br />My order came in really quick and was wrapped within a cellophane bag.  The headbands themselves were additionally wrapped up in their own individual bags. These headbands come in different colors which expands the flexibility to wear with my favorite workout gear. The manufacturer doe provide a 100 percent money back guarantee, but I have been happy with mine based on the softness, their ability to keep sweat and hair out of my eyes in addition to the quality of the material and manufacturing process.  No flaws I can see in any of the five headbands, and they appear that they will last me quite a while.<br /><br />I did receive this product to try out at a discount for my unbiased and completely honest feedback. I do routinely provide feedback on products I try (paid or at a discount) so that other shoppers and friends may avoid some of the not so good choices on products they are looking for while avoiding the bad products.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not for me", "text": "I hadn't had much experience with waxing, however I have tried wax pearls before and that definitely wasn't working for me, and though I usually just stick with good old fashioned razors but I thought I would try these easy to use wax strips. They are pretty easy to use too! The instructions are on the back of the box and they even have pictures for you to follow. To heat up the wax strips all you have to do is use your hands and rub them and the heat from your body allows the wax to warm up enough for you to pull the paper apart. You simply stick the wax strips on the area that you want the hair removal. It didn't really say how long you should leave it on before removing it but I feel like it needs to cool a bit to get a bit harder before you pull it off. One of my issues is that I didn't feel like it pulled off all the hair that I wanted to be gone within that area that I put the strip. If I am going to go through some pain for this hair removal I don't want to have to do it multiple times on the same area of skin.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Easy to use and wash out, not for long hair", "text": "This product is actually really cool and just as easy to use in real life as it seems like in the pictures. Comes with a silvery tone putty type substance in a little container all you have to do is put your hands in kind of rub it around your hands and then run it through your hair. It was really the easy to do on someone else but takes a little bit more time to do on yourself though if you get some on your skin or ears or wherever you can just take a wet damp towel or a white or something like that and wipe it right off. In the picture that shows you doing it too long hair but I tried it on my long hair and absolutely did not work I could not pull a comb through it and it was hard and strange and it definitely works better on men's hair that is short. When it was dry it got kind of hard like a gel or something like that. It's really easy to make it look nice you just have to continue working it through the hair until you get the desired color and style that you want. We tried it on a beard as well and it didn't look as good on the beard it kind of looked better on the medium to short hair but not super super short like a beard. We even used it and my boyfriend's hair who is African-American and it came out pretty cool. Kind of makes you look like you have silver gray hair. It was really easy to wash out renting it out just with water gets a lot of it off but a little bit of shampoo get it out in just a second. I don't recommend going to bed with this in your hair as it will leave silver glimmery stuff on your pillowcase to make sure you wash before going to sleep or laying down on anything.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610OtbxuFqL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610OtbxuFqL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610OtbxuFqL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611E8xr88fL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611E8xr88fL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611E8xr88fL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614+js6+eUL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614+js6+eUL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614+js6+eUL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YdaeufZwL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YdaeufZwL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YdaeufZwL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pL+Yj-3RL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pL+Yj-3RL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pL+Yj-3RL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rs1mmcAML._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rs1mmcAML._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rs1mmcAML.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CiBFaelcL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CiBFaelcL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CiBFaelcL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOHstYrqL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOHstYrqL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FOHstYrqL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gdjg7cV9L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gdjg7cV9L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Gdjg7cV9L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H0tuMKfgL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H0tuMKfgL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H0tuMKfgL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NE4kafm2L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NE4kafm2L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NE4kafm2L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-FqufmwgL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-FqufmwgL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-FqufmwgL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B-EJYNg8L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B-EJYNg8L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B-EJYNg8L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B073CW1R4T", "parent_asin": "B073CW1R4T", "user_id": "AGCQR2QLP3XWU64TBYFJCAZWQQKQ", "timestamp": 1555975712037, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

This Biotin Infused Zenlash Eyelash Growth Serum is definitely easy to use.

It came in just a clear plastic cover. The braiding and knit of the yarn is very nice, with no frayed or loose hanging ends that I could see.

It was thicker than I expected it to be and keeps your head nice and warm. I did notice it seems to ride up on the back of my head a bit which I do not like, but that is no problem of the product, just the nature of the design. It looks a bit strange with your hair down but looks pretty cute with it up in a messy bun. I think I would have liked it a bit more if it was a bit less wide, because it covers so much that it looks a bit strange.

The bottle is very cute, and the pink liquid in the clear glass makes it look very feminine. It even has a plastic top that looks like crystal, very cute. Inspired By Juicy Couture Perfume, but I cant imagine Juicy would smell like this.Overwhelmingly floral, its okay, but its more like something my grandmother would wear.

It is supposed to be inspired by Juicy, however I have not ever tried Juicy before so I cant tell you how close it is unfortunately. I can tell you, however, that it smells very fruity with a milk floral scent. Very sweet and refreshing and very hip for the younger women. Almost like a fruity dryer sheet, but in a good way. It comes in a rectangular clear bottle and the perfume itself is pink and very girly, it even has a pink bow around the spray nozzle. I think this 2.8 Fl. Oz. / 80 ml bottle should last quite a while, and after 3 good sprays in the morning I cold still smell it on my shirt at the end of the night.

Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece.

If you have a short beard like me this is a great product and I would recommend it to even Uncle Si from Duck Commander with the big beard he and the rest of the family have.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The \"Dirty Brown\" is good match for Ash Brown. If you like a messy look, this is a good choice", "text": "My natural hair color is light to medium Ash Brown, depending on how manufacturers label their colors.  (Unfortunately, there's not alot of uniformity in the industry when it comes to color labels).  I look for #8 if the color number is given.  Even then, you can NEVER be sure unless you see it in person, and Ash Brown is particulary hard to find.  The picture of the \"Dirty Brown\" bun looked to be a close match to my hair, but the pictures often lie, too,....and \"Dirty Brown\"??  In all my searches for ash brown hair pieces, this is the first \"Dirty Brown\" color label I've come across. I took a chance, and it is ALMOST a perfect match to my hair color.  Even though it doesn't say that the Dirty Brown piece is ombre dyed, IT IS, and the lighter ends would not be my choice. Still, the darker \"roots\" of the piece are almost perfectly matched to mine, so I think I can pass it off as real.  I have very fine hair, and I do NOT like thick hair pieces. That's another hard thing to find,....hair pieces that aren't unrealistically thick and \"weighty\"!  This piece is full, but not TOO full, not so thick that it looks fakey or heavy.  The \"messy\" feature is definitely very messy, the hair is completely straight and a bit spiky looking, yet very soft to the touch.  The center opening is too big, the elastic to loose for me to wear it over my own ponytail or bun without additional fasteners.  I use a couple hidden bobby pins at the top of the piece to secure it to my own hair.  It's easy to do and unnoticeable but can sometimes get a little heavy and \"pulling\" if worn for hours.  I change the position of the bobby pins, move them off to the sides, if it starts to bother me, so it's not a deal breaker.  This messy bun (more like a mess pony) is very well suited for around home, when running errands, or for any casual event with casual dress.  I don't think it would work well (and I would not choose it) for more formal events or dressier attire.  I really, really like this piece!  95% of my life is \"casual\", and I know I'll get alot of wear out it.  These things don't last forever, so when I find an affordable piece that matches my natural hair color and my life style, I usually go back and get a \"spare\".  That's a winner in my world, and this one got a medal, so I'm back to buy the spare!", "images": [], "asin": "B08B83H5NQ", "parent_asin": "B08B83H5NQ", "user_id": "AFBOHXRGHO3LQ2PYOB5URT5XESFQ", "timestamp": 1596152497894, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

What I like about this one is that it goes down to 80C (176F).  It was so cool that I was not sure it was on.  I have fine hair, high porosity that is 5 months post-straightening relaxer.  And, I find that light heat with a silicone-based glosser helps to gently close the cuticle and to keep my roots from tangling.  What I don\u2019t like is that this brush design does not have the round guiding bristles around the edges that help to pull your hair into the hearing plate.  So, it feels like you are brushing your hair with your elbow and that it is not penetrating to the roots.  You have to grip the hair with your other hand so it feels like you are only getting the shaft of your hair.  So, the brush is best for people with longer hair who do not have curly roots or those who need the super low heat setting as an option.<br /><br />If you would like to be able to rake the brush over your roots to tame curls at 250 F and up, other bushes  to consider are https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FGV9NQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071HFQGJX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Effective in Healing and Clearing Skin", "text": "I cannot say enough good things about this Retinol Serum. I have tried several things from the Baebody line of products, and they have all been very high quality and very effective. I am a huge fan of Retinol and how it benefits the skin. I am at a crappy age where I still get breakouts, and I am starting to get wrinkles. I hate having the same gross skin as I did as a teenager. And I have tried everything! Prescription meds, prescription creams, ProActiv, micro-dermabrasion, chemical peels, etc,etc. Nothing seemed to help until I started using this Retinol Serum. Retinol is just a fancy word for Vitamin A and apparently me skin is in desperate need of it. It acts on DNA to promote healthy epidermal skin cells. It does a great job of moisturizing my skin, which helps with wrinkles. And it also does a great job of preventing breakouts. If I do break out because of hormones, it helps clear them up without drying out my skin. Sometimes it clears up my skin within a day or overnight. Vitamin A is a really potent antioxidant that protects your skin from free radicals, generates cell growth, and repairs damaged cells. Retinol belongs to a family called retinoids, and is one of the only substances that is small enough to penetrate the outer epidermal layer to the layer where collagen and elastin reside. It is really strong at first. It is really effective and it is tempting to want to use too much too often, but it can end up irritating the skin. I started using it every other day at first and then built up to using it every day. I also like to use a Vitamin C serum, but using Vitamin C and Retinol together tends to decrease their effectiveness. And sunlight decreased the effectiveness of Retinol, so I use the Vitaming C serum in the morning and the Retinol Serum at night. I let it work it's magic while I sleep. It has helped clear up my skin and help heal sun spots and acne scars. My only regret about it is that I didn't start using this years ago! I was able to try this Retinol Serum at a promotional discount for testing and reviewing purposes and in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.", "images": [], "asin": "B01EJ3C5OM", "parent_asin": "B01EJ3C5OM", "user_id": "AFLTT7DDWVQXXNA6ASQLE3Z4RVTQ", "timestamp": 1465132537000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Deceptive, and cheap.", "text": "I am so very disappointed with this product line by Amorepacific. I love their other brands, IOPE and sulwhasoo. But I was in the search for a more affordable toner/emulsion/serum and was excited when they introduced this line and gave a discount. They really sold this beta-hyaluronic whatever that works 1.5x better and I thought it was a new patented technology. But no. Contrary to their marketing claim, there is no such thing as beta hyaluronic acid.  Yes I looked up patent registry and trademark registry and Amorepacific didn\u2019t register anything new in the past few years related to hyaluronic acid. They just put a new spin on beta glucan, which according to some studies works 20% better, not 150% like they claim. Also beta glucan is toward the end of the ingredient list, meaning we have no idea how much of it is even in there. It\u2019s so disappointing that Amorepacific decides to just flat out lie to customers about it. Makes me go wonder what else they are lying about.<br /><br />Now I would not have done all the research if the serum worked well in the first place. But it came with no safety seal which made me go um. The packaging felt cheap. The liquid felt cheap and diluted. My skin smelled like plastic. My skin didn\u2019t stay hydrated like other serums and that\u2019s when I knew something was up. I bought toner, emulsion and serum. The emulsion was sealed but the toner and serum was not. I didn\u2019t even bother trying the emulsion. I\u2019ll be returning these all. I will also be seeking new skincare products that are not made by Amorepacific.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "No difference after three weeks of consistent use, and product won't dispense through pump.", "text": "ANOTHER UPDATE:<br /><br />My dermatologist told me that unless a Vitamin C serum contained the L-ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C, I was wasting my money and doing little to improve my skin.  I found a serum here on Amazon that contains 17% L-ascorbic acid, and I've been using it for approx. 3 weeks.  What a difference!  I can definitely feel it working for one thing (it burns for about 5 seconds), but more importantly, I can SEE the difference in my skin already.  At first I thought my eyesight was going downhill, but then I realized my skin really did look smoother and had a new glow.  Do an Amazon search for L-ascorbic Vitamin C serum to get the good stuff.<br /><br />Having said all this, I have added a LOT more spinach to my daily regimen lately, so I'm sure that's contributing to my skin's appearance too.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finished the bottle which gave me about 5 weeks of use.  If it made any difference in my skin, it's at a microscopic level.  I'm buying another bottle - mainly because there's got to be SOME truth to all the 5-star reviews.  But if, after another month or so of use, I still don't see improvement in my skin, I'm asking a dermatologist for a Rx for Retin-A.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I've been using this product for three weeks, and I have yet to see any improvement in my skin.  I'm amazed (and not a little skeptical) about some people seeing results in two weeks.  I also wonder how many 5-star reviews were written by people who were given the product to try.<br /><br />I'm very methodical about using new products on my skin.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror, establish a &#34;baseline&#34; area of my skin to observe over time, and take close-up &#34;selfies&#34; of my skin to compare with photos taken a few weeks later.  No difference so far, but I'll continue to use this product until it's gone.<br /><br />I DO like that this retinol doesn't irritate my skin, which is highly unusual.  So unusual, it makes me wonder if it indeed contains any retinol.<br /><br />In conclusion, and not a critique of the product itself, but the product won't dispense through the pump.  It's too thick.  I'm having to pull the cap off and shake the serum on to my fingertips. I wish it came with a dropper instead.  I changed out out the pump with a dropper from another bottle of serum.  I'm surprised I haven't read about this problem in other reviews. Another reason I'm leery of all the glowing comments.<br /><br />I'll update with my progress, or lack thereof, at a later date.", "images": [], "asin": "B00NT0AR7E", "parent_asin": "B00NT0AR7E", "user_id": "AEAJBHE5KH74FQG2U4WJVGACT7PA", "timestamp": 1428935935000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

If the top part (the arch holding the bristles above the foot) was at an angle, the edge wouldn't hit your foot and it would make the whole thing allot easier/comfortable to use. The only other (minor) change that I would like is for it to have more bristles in the back instead of the stone and the bristles in general could be a bit firmer as they are very soft.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice inexpensive product that works great for me.", "images": [], "asin": "B004H5D40W", "parent_asin": "B004H5D40W", "user_id": "AHRYTKFZELEQPIVW6BVMNYRF4DMA", "timestamp": 1490275124000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love this razer, just like I loved the previous model (same razer)", "text": "Summary: Nothing not to like!<br /><br />Background: Previously, I owned the earlier model of this razer. It was the same exact razer except it used to be blue. I loved this razer, but it was eaten by a dog! I didnt want to cough up the full cost of this direct replacement, so I used a lower-end Norelco. As you may know, the lower models do not feature the \"Speed-XL\" shaving heads (which have 3 concentric rings of blades (per head)). Instead it had the single outer row of blades, which is pretty typical of any non-high-end razer.<br /><br />Why this razer is good:<br />The point of my background story is that there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between the Speed-XL models, and older style heads. In fact THERE IS NO COMPARISON!  With the cheaper razer I had to go over my face at least twice as much, and usually more like 3x as much as with this razer. As with all electric's, you're not going to be able to make a single pass and get everything, but as electric's go, this razer (and all the Norelco's with Speed-XL) works great. Both myself and my dad (who is used to foil razers) agree that Speed-XL is the best electric we've used!<br /><br />Some niceties of this razer are that its VERY easy to clean. Usually you can just pop the top and tap most of the hair out, maybe use the brush real quick. I dont feel like I have to do a deep cleaning (taking the heads out and apart) very often because it doesnt seem to trap a lot of hair in the heads. But if you want to, its very easy to access everything.<br />The body is waterproof, so you can clean it out with water as a middle ground between just tapping hair out and dissassembly.<br />The charger is now VERY small, and takes up only a single plug (even on a strip), and the base is also small.<br />Battery life: lets me shave for multiple days (at least 4) before it needs charging.<br /><br />That said there are some minor quibbles. Like most Norelco razers, the charger doesnt shut off automatically, so you need to be careful with leaving it plugged in all the time. My solution: leave the charger in a draw, keep the stand on my countertop to hold the razer all the time, and then just get the charger out (and plug it into the stand) when the razer actually needs charged, which for me is only ever handful of days. this also has the added benefit of saving some small amount of energy by not having the wall wart plugged in while you're not charging.<br />This razer now comes with a form fitting travel case, and you cant put the razer in it with the hair gaurd on it :( so make sure you clean it before you travel with it. You also cant fit the charger in the case...its really a case JUST for the razer, to protect it in your regular toiletries bag.<br /><br />All in all any of the speed-xl razers will cut the same, so just buy the model that has the accessories you want. I think this model represents the best value because its the cheapest :) personally i dont care about a multi-step battery readout, or a cleaning station...but if you do buy those versions.", "images": [], "asin": "B0009MFUOA", "parent_asin": "B0009MFUOA", "user_id": "AGJNM4JNLYNTT6N7VPOXUWM2PB4A", "timestamp": 1221927204000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "So much better than 5 magnet eyelashes", "text": "After trying several of the 5 magnet type, I found these and I'm so glad I did!  The 5 magnet type never worked after I tried to cut them to the right size because there was never a magnet on the end, which made it impossible to get them to stay on without using glue. I found these with 10 smaller magnets and thought I would give them a try! I was able to cut them to the right size and still have magnets on both ends, so they would stay on. I am not very good at applying liquid liner, but I was able to get this liner to work just fine. I used these for my wedding and they stayed on all day/evening and weren't too heavy feeling like some lashes. They really made my eyes pop and stand out beautifully in pictures!  In the photos, the close ups were before the wedding to try them out, and although the one end wouldn't stay on that time, I was able to get it to stay on the wedding day.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like (which is the same with all of these magnetic liners) is that the liner is difficult to remove. The lashes themselves came off fine, but the liner was not easy to remove (from my skin or the lashes). I don't like to use makeup removers, so I used coconut oil. It took some time to get it off. But I don't think that's anything specific to this liner, it's the magnetic liners in general.<br /><br />I recommend these lashes over all of those 5 magnet ones!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gnkPm+msL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gnkPm+msL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gnkPm+msL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jji+z7GtL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jji+z7GtL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jji+z7GtL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFmN2apkL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFmN2apkL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vFmN2apkL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xH2hQhxnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xH2hQhxnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xH2hQhxnL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08Q76S3MS", "parent_asin": "B08Q76S3MS", "user_id": "AEASREL4ZDAI7OAYLS7YOVJUXASA", "timestamp": 1614968643433, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

Very specific and she didn\u2019t want anything that did not have at least those two ingredients.<br /><br />The reason is a conversation with her dermatologist. Matrixxyl is made of 2 peptides, palmitoyl-tripeptide and palmitoyl-oligopeptide, which stimulate collagen and elastin production in the skin. And peptides form a long chain of amino acids to become proteins, penetrating the top layer of skin cells and signaling the cells including collagen.<br /><br />The Cazbe serum works really nicely in tandem with my mom\u2019s Ponds cream (she has used Ponds as long as I remember). The serum absorbs pretty rapidly and unlike other serums, doesn\u2019t seem to leave her skin feeling sort of \u2018tight\u2019 or dry.

It seems to absorb quickly and is not oily.<br /><br />Some note on the ingredients:<br /><br />Retinol 2.5% - Retinol is another name for Vitamin A, which is an antioxidant (helps reverse the damage caused by free radicals, apparent in wrinkles and aging), encourages the production of collagen, and elastin.<br />Jojoba Oil - closely resembles sebum (a waxy substance produced by our skin glands), packed with vitamins and minerals - Vitamin E, B, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine and chromium.<br />Green Tea - Tea is high in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, whether ingested or applied topically. Green tea contains tannins which can reduce puffiness and inflammation of the skin. It also contains polyphenols, which can combat free radicals (which contribute to aging). The catechins in tea can combat the bacteria that contribute to acne.<br />Propolis - Propolis, \u201cbee glue or bee penicillin\u201d is the resinous material gathered by honeybees from flowers and leaf buds of various plants. It contains dozens of anti-oxidants,<br />Shea Butter - The moisturizers in shea butter are similar to those produced by the skin\u2019s sebaceous glands, making it one of the best choices for super-dry or cracked skin. Shea butter also contains anti-inflammatory compounds \u2013 great for applying to inflamed or irritated skin (think eczema, chapped skin, bug bites)<br />Vitamin B5 - A humectant (a water-binding substance that attracts and retains water). Particularly good for the skin as it stabilizes the skin barrier, increasing hydration and improving softness and elasticity.<br />Vitamin E - A powerful antioxidant, that neutralizes the oxidant effect of free radicals, which are molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles<br /><br />*I received the retinol cream for evaluation and review", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mIjZcSuLL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mIjZcSuLL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mIjZcSuLL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dj3zQYALL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dj3zQYALL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dj3zQYALL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B00VXEQ0WO", "parent_asin": "B00VXEQ0WO", "user_id": "AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q", "timestamp": 1463189525000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

I guess the best solution is not to laugh, but then what fun would life be...<br /><br />What is Hyaluronic acid? According to WebMD, &#34;Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues. In addition, it might affect the way the body responds to injury.&#34;<br /><br />(+) Does it work? I've used the Hyaluronic serum every night for a week now. Not sure if I can say 100% that I have noticed no fine lines around my eyes, but I've had 2 friends remark that my skin is looking great. As we women know, that's a good endorsement right there.<br /><br />(+) Texture: As you can see in the photo, the Derma-nu serum is a clear, slightly viscous consistency that goes on clear. You can feel it on your skin for quite a few minutes afterwards. It does NOT leave your skin feeling greasy (big pet peeve of mine) when you wake up in the morning.<br /><br />(+) Smell: This is not a scented beauty product. There is a very slight almost medicinal scent - that's the best way to describe it. It is not unpleasant, it is extremely mild, but it smells like it has some ingredients that 'have a purpose', vs. beauty products that have fragrances added.<br /><br />(+) Packaging and ease of use: The pump is well made - it dispenses a small amount of serum, which I am finding is enough for applying to the corners of both eyes. I'm having to &#34;prime&#34; the pump about 2-3 times before it dispenses the serum, so be careful, you don't want to double pump the serum unless you are OK putting possibly 2x the amount on your face than you might have intended.<br /><br />(+) A little goes a long way. I travel a lot, so the compact bottle and efficient dispensing from the pump are bonuses for me.<br /><br />(/) Organic. The bottle indicates that 72% of the ingredients are organic. It doesn't clarify which of the ingredients are/are not organic.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great shave, great value - use with Letric Shave", "text": "I tried electric razors ten years ago with a Braun model but my skin was too sensitive and I received nicks and cuts and a poor shave.  Three years ago, I tried again with a Remington, and it worked great for my head -- not so great for my face.  Lots of nicks, and spread a rash. I was especially disappointed that it didn't get my neck very well. Both shavers were straight foil shavers, as I thought they would shave closer than round heads.<br /><br />Then, I purchased this Norelco over 2 months ago, and it has worked like a dream for me.  While the first week wasn't especially close, it was convenient as I was traveling for work.  By the third week, however, the shave was CLOSER than my regular Mach 3 blade shave!<br /><br />One huge difference: I bought some Letric Shave pre-shave liquid, which makes the whiskers stand up, and also disinfects the shaving heads. I haven't had one cut, and no rash, in over 60 shaves with this unit.  Since then, I have used the Norelco every morning, along with the Letric Shave, and have been thrilled with the results.  I have also wondered whether my previous experience with an electric would have been better had I $3.49 to get the pre-shave splash!<br /><br />I have to agree with one poster who complained about the plastic parts - the only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars.  I don't really know how long this unit will run.  I do know in 2 months, I have already saved more on this unit than disposable blades would have cost.  And, travel is a snap.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Literal Nightmare", "text": "To preface my review this is my first attempt with at-home waxing & I'm Trans MTF. I've waxed plenty in my lifetime, but always at a salon by a professional. Now I'm sitting here typing this review with an incredibly thin layer of wax all way down my still very hairy left leg.<br /><br />I purchased the wax roughly 3 months ago, so I don't think the wax is expired, and it was stored in the original packaging in the meantime. I think the main issue is with the roller unit in general. I was literally pulling more hairs out just rolling the wax onto my leg than I was will the couple of strips I did manage to try. I don't have an issue with pulling hairs or anything. Tweezing nose hairs, or threading is WAY more painful and I don't have an issue with either of those.<br /><br />It took the unit forever to just warm up enough, instructions are laughable at best (broken unclear English), the included wax cleanup wipes are useless & dry (I'm about to google how to remove all this excess wax off my leg in a moment here). I feel if I could break open the unit and heat the wax over the stove it would work 100% better, but I don't want to risk my cookware.<br /><br />Update: #1: I was able to successfully microwave the cartridge for 3 mins in a bowl of water. 5 minutes would likely work better for you as my cartridge was still warm when I started. The wax rolled much nicer this time around, but still required some pulling, however it started to pool on one side of the roller resulting in the whole roller stopping again and even got a spot onto my bathroom rug that I had been carefully avoiding... The irritation from the wax is worse than using a depilatory cream (such as Nair)<br /><br />Update #2: After oven an hour of attempting to remove the wax with various products. (baby oil, oil-free makeup remover, acetone, rubbing alcohol, body wash, and finally olive oil in that order). The olive oil and now trashed white washcloth finally did the trick. I really can't recommend avoiding this product enough.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Good Value for Your Money With Pleasing Results", "text": "I bought this product, the Neutrogena Wave because I wanted to take my skincare regimin to the next level. I looked at the competetors but settled on this product due to the price of $12.97 at Walmart. It comes with the massager, pop-out attachment for the cleansing pad,(14) and a AA battery along with 14 cleansing pads. First, let me say I'm in my fifty's so skincare is important to me but I don't have the luxury of spending hundreds on skincare products. My skin is now starting to show signs of aging by fine lines and deep wrinkles and circles under my eyes. My main goal from this product is for my skin to improve in the following areas:<br /><br />more even skin texture<br />more radiance<br />more firmness<br />more softer, subtle feel<br />help with deep skin cleansing and exfoliation<br /><br />  I used this product today for the first time following the instructions carefully. The product is very well made so far as the size as it comfortably fits in your palm. The attachment which holds the cleanser pad comes of easily and the cleansing pad attachs to it with no problems. Simply wet the pad with some water and push the button to start.You can also re- wet the pad if more is needed later. The vibration is both somewhat quiet but not irritating on the skin at all. You don't need to push on the product while holding it as it does the massaging for you!! The cleansing pads have a nice smell to them- nothing too perfumy, just a nice clean smell. Simply guide the skin massager over your face concentrating on the areas that you feel need the most attention. You control how long you feel each area needs to be cleansed.<br />  I found my skin afterward to be more soft and brighter than before I used the Neutrogena Wave. It was easy to use and control and can ber used in the shower. The cleansing pads are available for about $6.49 for about 1-2 months worth depending on how often you use the product. It is gentle enough I feel you could use it every day depending on yourt skin type.<br />  Bottom line is, if you don't want to spend alot for a \"skin rejuvenator\" than consider the Neutrogena Wave! I think you'll like the results and for alot less too!!", "images": [], "asin": "B0011TI8TO", "parent_asin": "B0011TI8TO", "user_id": "AGYOYIHQZEWC4L7R3DW3NWTQIZGQ", "timestamp": 1225753689000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

Works best to physically unwrap the strand of hair you're curling rather than pulling downward as with a traditional clipless wand.  Any reviews stating this wand does not give curl either has too short of hair, isn't using a high enough heat setting, or is completely doing it wrong.  You really need to use your right hand over your head to curl the left and vice versa for the right.  The black cool tip should be pointing downward as you curl.

Soon as I opened the bottle I added several drops to a small old bottle I own and left it open exposing to air, lights and anything else that causes oxidizing to the vitamin c. It stayed clear. After one week straight no changes. I even popped into the microwave for 8 seconds still clear. Had it contained ferulic acid I would have been less skeptic because FA is a Vitamin C stabilizer. On its own Vitamin C (L-absorbic acid) is unstable and begins to oxidize once the seal is broken. Yes even pure vitamin C in water it will turn a slight yellow and begin to darken.<br /><br />But my skin did not break out a good thing. Even if it doesn\u2019t contain vitamin c the other ingredients are a plus especially glycerin as the second ingredient ... which is a natural humectant, anti microbial and antiviral all meaning moisturized skin that won\u2019t get clogged and controls acne. I do get acne (thank the skin gurus) but I do chemical exfoliate with acids and use a retinol. Two things that cause dry skin.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Very Good Electric Shaver for Sensitive Skin", "text": "As someone with very sensitive skin, I have always had problems with razor burn after shaving. Dry electric shavers tend to butcher my skin.  Traditional multi-blade razors (like the Mach 3) are easier on my skin, but as sensitive as my skin is, cuts are not uncommon.  A few months ago I received a Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive In/Out of Shower Shaver as a gift and gave it a try.  Thanks to the shaving gel that can be applied to the skin at the touch of a button while shaving, it provides a very close shave that doesn't cut my skin like a traditional razor, and there's very little skin irritation afterwards.  As for closeness, I'd say that it's almost as good as a Mach 3 razor.<br /><br />One aspect about this shaver that I like is that it operates from a rechargeable battery so that there's no electric cord to get in the way while shaving.  Also, the shaving gel packets are easy to replace, it comes with a charger stand, it's easy to clean the rotating blades and it takes up little bathroom counter space.  Further, it takes less time to shave and clean-up afterwards than with a traditional razor & shaving cream.<br /><br />Overall, I regard the Norelco 7735X Cool Skin Additive In/Out of Shower Shaver as a very good shaver and rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  Granted, it is somewhat expensive, but if you have very sensitive skin like me, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was with its performance.", "images": [], "asin": "B0001HYKBM", "parent_asin": "B0001HYKBM", "user_id": "AF3O6MMTBRDPO2SVTSEK6YLZVHPQ", "timestamp": 1129253143000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

So I of course ordered these when I seen them. Upon arrival I was very pleased with them. I absolutely loved the packaging especially the box the bows arrived in, which can be used for storage when not in use.  We took them out right away and couldn't have been happier. These bows are made very well and seem to be very sturdy. The colors/design are very nice and put together well. The colors are great and they should definitely match with anything you may need. The ribbon on these is of nice quality and it shows. They are infact the size mentioned in the add, which can sometimes be a surprise upon arrival. They are on alligator clips, which was exactly what we were wanting. These particular clips have grips on them which make them even easier. They stay in place with no problems, even during rough play. One of the best things about these is that they are very light weight. Lighter than most of our bows, especially for the size. These have a soft of silky-ness to them which I have found helps tremendously when trying to clean them. I use a baby wipe and have no issues wiping off anything that has managed to get on them. I'm so glad I found these and we were able to try them out. I have  no doubt that they will last a while to come, being they are made so well. I'm completely happy with my purchase and I will be recommending them to my friends and family.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Real \"Miracle In A Jar\" For Me!", "text": "I've been a user of the Alpha Hydrox products for several years. I'm 38 going on 39, and some people still mistake me for 25 to early 30's. I especially love the 12% Souffle cream. Trust me, if you purchase this product, it will work SO well that you may take it for granted someday. Don't! I made that mistake, and it almost cost me my skin!<br /><br />I had run out of the souffle and was lazy one day when repurchasing my skin care products, so I bought a drugstore brand of a popular new \"Simply Radiant\" skin care system with fancy \"Soy Proteins\" in it. I wanted to even out my skin tone (African-American, with a couple of dark dots left over from a few small pimples). After using the moisturizer for a week, I started developing cystic acne-type bumps on my face!! BIG pus-filled lumps that developed in clusters on my cheeks and forehead. I was horrified. I immediately stopped using the moisturizer, and the cysts stopped developing, but the damage was done; I had slowly-healing cystic acne bumps on my face. When I returned the cream to the drug store, the clerk took one look at me and quickly gave me my money back; the bad skin reaction was that obvious.<br /><br />I ordered the Alpha Hydrox 12% Souffle as soon as I could, along with the Alpha Hydrox 14% AHA swipes to help accelerate my skin exfoliation. I used the swipes 3 times a week, and the souffle morning and night. After a month, I finally got the acne under control. After two months, my skin was smooth again.  After six months, I was able to take the most gorgeous headshots I've ever had done, and the graphic artist only had to retouch \"shine\" on my forehead and chin. There's only a pinhead-sized indentation left over from the acne scars, and all the deep-colored hyperpigmented spots have completely healed and disappeared. My skin is baby-smooth, even toned, and if I had told you that approximately eight months ago I had deep acne scars on my face, you would never believe me.<br /><br />I'm back to just the Souffle morning and evening for maintenance, but I'll NEVER take using my Alpha Hydrox products for granted ever again!", "images": [], "asin": "B000G8LWZI", "parent_asin": "B000G8LWZI", "user_id": "AHVLRJDI6K2KCVNGHQACGTKSKZDA", "timestamp": 1310022531000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "take good care of the internal battery", "text": "I bought this trimmer two months ago.  I use it to keep my hair very short.  I have not gone to a barber ever since I bought this.  I simply turn the dial to set the guard to level 5 and cut all of my hair the same lenght.  Definitely easy to use.  On my short hair, I can probably get four complete haircuts in one charge.  This is a good trimmer for those men who like to keep their hair very short all the way around.  Use it two times and it would have paid for itself due to the fact that you were able to avoid going to a barber.<br />This is my second Norelco trimmer.  My first one was a T6000 that I bought back in February of 2001.  The battery stopped taking a charge four months ago, after almost 3 years of use.  I called Norelco to have the battery replaced, and I was then informed that they do not replace the batteries on these trimmers since replacing the battery would cost as much as buying a newer unit.  So, I ordered the newer T860 from Amazon.  The T860 functions just like the older T6000.  In addition, the T860 can also function as a corded trimmer, in the event the battery stops taking a charge.  The service life of the trimmer can extend beyond the life of the rechargeable battery by using the cord.  I am satisfied with it.<br />By the way, the reason why the battery got damaged in my older T6000 was that I kept the unit plugged in the charger stand for very long periods of time.  I later learned not to do that, as that practice will damage the battery over time.  Overcharging even a little seems to damage the battery over time.  It's best to read the directions so you will know how to properly care for the battery.  The battery basically will determine the life of the unit.  The cutters do not wear out, from what I can tell.  The motor seems durable.  So the life of the unit is really how long you can keep the internal rechargeable battery working.  Norelco's internal rechargeable Ni-Cad batteries can last a long time, if given proper care.  They seem to be of good quality.<br />I had a Norelco 885 razor, and the battery was still taking a charge after nine years.  The razor had the advantage of having a five level battery meter that tells you how much charge is left in the internal batteries.  Basically, you want to wait until there is only a little charge left before you put the unit in the charger.  It seems this trimmer is a bit different though.  The instructions on the T860 unit say to completely drain the battery.  Which would be a bit inconvenient.  With the T860 trimmer, it takes 10 hours for a full charge.  Recharge fully.  That way,  you can minimize the dreaded \"memory effect\" or voltage depression and extend the useful life of the rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeable batteries are permanently soldered inside the unit.  This trimmer unit, T860, does not have a charge meter.  I refrained from getting the pricier unit with a charge meter in order to economize.  However, my advice to you, if you're not too cost-sensitive, is to get a unit with a charge meter.  That way, you will know when to charge the unit and when to remove the unit from the charger.  That precise practice should help extend the life of the battery, and hence, the unit.", "images": [], "asin": "B000068PBR", "parent_asin": "B000068PBR", "user_id": "AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ", "timestamp": 1077770771000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Good Shaver from Norelco", "text": "This is the latest shaver in Norelco's Quadra system.  The shaving heads are mounted in such a way that gives them the freedom to depress independently of one another, to better adapt to the unique contours of your face.  Another advantage to this razor is that the shaving heads can be washed under the faucet.  This is a feature that the Quadra system razors share with the more expensive Spectra system razors.<br />This razor is light-years better than my previous Norelco.  My last Norelco was the 885, bought back in 1991.  That razor always irritated my skin, especially the neck area.  Although it did last nine years.  Three years ago, I switched to the Braun Syncro system.  The Braun worked very well for me.  Anyway, I decided to give Norelco another try.  I was very surprised, and impressed, to say the least.  This Quadra shaves just as close and just as comfortable as the Braun Syncro.  And, it is very quiet.  So far, I am only getting 35 minutes of shaving time per charge.  But, I believe that the battery will reach its full capacity after a few more discharge and charge cycles.<br />For me, it is an even choice between this Norelco and the Braun.  I can readily recommend either one.  I suppose you just might have to try both and see which one will work better for you.  One thing is obvious though.  Either one will save you money in the long run, compared to using a blade shaver like the Mach 3, for example.  The long-term cost of periodically buying replacement blades for a Mach 3 or Sensor Excel can easily exceed the price of either one of the electrics.  I will admit, however, that neither of the electric razors can match the closeness of the Mach 3.", "images": [], "asin": "B000068PBL", "parent_asin": "B000068PBL", "user_id": "AEF4REQMG4I6Y2JLLKMQE4U2QYXQ", "timestamp": 1075835579000, "helpful_vote": 46, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Bit Difficult to Use but Produces Very Pretty Curls!", "text": "For many years I've always straightened my hair because I cannot seem to get the hang of using curling irons to make pretty spiral curls. Wearing the same hairstyle all the time with long hair can get a bit boring so I decided to search on Amazon for styling tools that are easy to use. I initially ordered the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] and really loved the results so much that I also purchased this Rock 'n' Roller styling iron, which I affectionately call my &#34;bubble curler.&#34;<br /><br />The Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron comes with the iron itself along with a black protective glove to protect your hand from the heat of this iron since there is no clamp. The iron measures almost 15 inches in length, with the heating barrel measuring about 5 3/4 inches. The balls measure about one inch in diameter. The cord measures almost six feet so there is plenty of length to move around with it. The iron has a black ball at the top so you can hold it while using it, a safety stand that works well, an on/off switch, a temperature dial that allows you to choose among the low, medium, and high settings as well as the temperatures in between all of them, and a swivel cord so you can easily move the iron around as you use it. I found that it heats up quickly and cools off rapidly as well in case you need to pack it up in your suitcase soon after using it. The glove fits well but I didn't end up using it since it feels a bit awkward to use while trying to grip strands of hair so I took a chance and kept my hand bare, with no problems as long as I styled my hair in front of a mirror so I could watch closely what I was doing.<br /><br />I found this styling iron a bit difficult to use at first but it gets easier with practice. I just winged it and have included some pictures of my end result. There is a chart in the instructions as to what heat setting is most likely appropriate for your hair type but they recommend you start with the lowest setting and increase the heat as needed. I have wavy to medium hair so I started off using the low setting but ended up using the medium setting. I have long hair and it was fairly simple to wrap my hair around the barrel. When I got toward the end of the strands of hair, I carefully wrap them around the barrel, holding my fingers as close as I can to the styling iron without actually touching it. Then I roll the styling iron towards my head as close as I can so my hair gets curled as much as possible. I hold my hair in that position for about 40 seconds and then release it and curl my whole head. It probably took about a half hour to style all of my hair and then I finished by spraying it with hairspray. I didn't add any product to my hair before I started although you probably could if your hair works better that way.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this styling iron and really like the end result. Hopefully it will get easier to use with time. I found it a bit difficult to use because, without having a clamp on the iron, I had to hold both arms up in the air and my muscles got tired pretty quickly. I'm in fairly good shape but perhaps this will get easier with time. I actually prefer the [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]] because I feel it's easier to use and I love the beach waves I get from it so I will most likely use that one more but this one is still good to have. If you want spiral curls, I'd purchase the Rock 'n' Roller Styling Iron but if you prefer beach waves, I'd purchase the Deep Waver. The price is just what I wanted to spend and I like the fact that I can have more hairstyles than just straightened hair! I recommend purchasing this styling iron if you want to add some variety to your hairstyle and aren't comfortable using a regular curling iron to get spiral curls.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712CKS-OMvL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712CKS-OMvL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712CKS-OMvL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eeQholzJL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eeQholzJL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eeQholzJL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x3iRh91tL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x3iRh91tL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71x3iRh91tL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813OwRZVm+L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813OwRZVm+L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813OwRZVm+L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0092MCQZ4", "parent_asin": "B01M1OFZOG", "user_id": "AH4YBVO724V3BJUUFP4DBFQGNEHQ", "timestamp": 1469053357000, "helpful_vote": 92, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Dry Brushing for Leaky Gut Detox", "text": "I read, on a leaky gut blog, about dry brushing while doing detoxes so I ordered this brush to give it a try.  This thing is pretty cool to be honest and I am so glad I opted for the brush that can be modified as such.  I hate having \u201cstuff\u201d so anytime I can consolidate a product to be multi-use, especially living in a small space, it really helps.  So using the brush does not feel entirely unpleasant but I am sure it will be something to get used to.  It came wrapped in cellophane and really pretty tulle that it actually looked like a gift (a note for anyone ordering as a gift there is really no need to pay the extra fee for gift wrapping services).  Also there is a velour draw string bag that fits the brush when it is assembled.  The purple is gorgeous kind of reminds me of a Crown bag.  I tested the brush out on one arm at work (I have packages delivered to me at work) and my coworker said my arm feels softer than the other.  Oh and the TMI factor-I am calling it fairy dust for now but the white dust that flew off my arm, presumably dead skin, is kind of gross to see.  Makes me want to go home and brush every bit!  And so I will! I rarely give all 5 stars but I already love this thing<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  This is a required disclaimer per Amazon\u2019s review guidelines.

Win, win, win!", "text": "As the mother of two young children, I have become increasingly concern about environmental chemicals and their effects on children.  I've spent hours reading about pesticides and commonly-used chemical components in cosmetics, and have ultimately decided to do whatever I can to eliminate chemicals from my home.  After doing a lot of research on The Good Guide, I decided to try Method's product, as it received one of the best scores on the site.<br /><br />First off, I want to say that I absolutely love the pump!  I've had two babies, and wrestling with the tube of cream has always annoyed me.  The pump is far neater and easier to handle.  Now that I've tried it, I don't intend to ever go back to one of those nasty tubes.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is how this cream is the only one I've tried that actually stays where it is put.  I've used Desitin and California Baby's cream, and this is the only one that sticks to the red areas on my son's bottom.  The other two had a tendency to slide right off the really red parts and onto the skin surrounding them.  Needless to say, that was very annoying, considering the point of using the cream was to try to eliminate the read sores.  This cream has a nice, thick consistency and spreads far more easily than the other two brands I've mentioned.<br /><br />The big advantage to buying this in bulk on Amazon is that it no costs me no more than the tubes of Desitin that I used to buy.  I've already used many other Method products for the home (French lavender all-purpose cleanser, hand soap, etc.), and this product has only strengthened my love for the Method brand.

(But that's just my personal opinion) I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.<br /><br />I have been using this wonderful serum 3 times a week and the results are astounding! It's nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent. It's worked wonders on minimizing those fine lines I've started to notice. It has also helped clear up my skin by unclogging my pores. Sublime contains glycolic acid and salicylic acid which are natural fruit ingredients with exfoliating properties that encourages the sloughing of dead skin cells improving the tone and texture of my skin. My skin looks radiant and more youthful.<br /><br />It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Sublime works very well and has become part of my skin care routine.

I received this particular mask at a special price for the purposes of product testing and reviewing. Everything contained in this review is my own personal experience using this mask.<br />First I made sure my face was freshly washed and found a quiet area where I could apply the mask and lay back and relax for 20 minutes. By quiet area, I mean I made sure I was home alone so no one would bother me, I turned the television off and played some soft soothing music to relax myself and to really give myself that spa experience.<br />Applying the mask was super simple and it completely fit all the contours of my face evenly. Thereby giving my face all the wonderful benefits of this rich hydrating formula. Then I just relaxed and let the mask do all the work. I have sensitive skin and was pleased that the all natural ingredients in this mask did not irritate my sensitive skin what so ever. In fact, it actually helped improve the look and feel of my skin after just one use. After the 20 minutes were up, I was amazed at how soft and hydrated my skin felt. I had no idea I had let my skin get that dry. I plan on taking time out for myself at least once a week to give myself a deep hydrating, anti-aging mask. After all, the key to younger looking skin, is keeping it well hydrated. I love these masks and would also recommend them.

I also like that it's paraben free, not tested on animals, contains no dyes or fragrances and is made in America. I don't like that it contains Alcohol. It is on the bottom of the ingredient list but I'm thinking that it's needed to combat the stickiness. It does a great job at waking up tired eyes. Within minutes, fine lines fill in as this product seems to plump up your skin. Where I find it to be a problem is that I have to follow it up with another eye cream to lose the stickiness before applying makeup. On days when I don't wear makeup, it's not a problem.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fragrance and Performance Both Surprising", "text": "I admit I\u2019m a shaving hobbyist. Soaps are like Pok\u00e9mon, gotta catch \u2018me all.<br /><br />But we hobby shavers end up using these soaps once or twice and if they aren\u2019t in our top 20 we put them up on the Reddit shaver trading boards. This way we can try ten soaps for the price of two, keep the ones we like and trade the rest looking for more winners.<br /><br />Ladies and germs, this is a winner. My first Ogallalla product, I tried it on the recommendation of a guy I frequently trade with whose tastes are similar in many ways and who likes and demands the same performance characteristics of his shaving soaps. When he recommends one I sit up and listen.<br /><br />So let\u2019s talk performance. This soap, with my 26mm synthetic shaving brush, makes a ton of lather. A surprising amount. I kept adding water to get it down from \u201ccake batter\u201d to \u201cpancake batter\u201d to the soft whipped peaks and glossy sheen that lets me know it\u2019s hydrated enough for maximum slickness. A nice thirsty shaving stick. Hooray. The ingredient list is vegan. I generally prefer soaps with tallow bases and added lanolin but I\u2019m open minded about it. There are some vegan soaps in my keeper drawer.<br /><br />Slickness was very good. Not quite what you can get from B&M\u2019s \u201cReserve\u201d line or good old Mitchell\u2019s Wool Fat but very close. Lather, once worked to a good sheen and soft peaks, did not dissipate on the brush or dry on my skin. Maintains hydration well. Once again, B&M does it better, but for over $4 an ounce it ought to. For $1.50/oz. this stuff performs very well indeed. And as a bonus they include the plastic stick dispenser you won\u2019t get from Arko or Speick. I just found my go-to travel shaving soap.<br /><br />Scent: clovey but not as clovey as Ogallala\u2019s matching aftershave, particularly the double strength. I found following my shave with Ogallala Bay Rum + Sweet Orange aftershave, regular strength, left my face smooth, disinfected, hydrated, and smelling like a Christmas tree but in a good way. The traditional clove top note fades on the dry down, leaving you with a really good scent for the rest of the day.<br /><br />Some guys hate cloves. They get their bay rum fix from B&M, which uses no clove in its bay rum products. I like that too.<br /><br />But this is a fantastic shaving experience for a shockingly low price, with added travel benefits. I\u2019ll especially use it as the weather cools. I\u2019m not keeping it because it performs well relative to price. I\u2019m keeping it because it performs well regardless of price. The low price and portability are bonuses.<br /><br />If you are a spice aficionado like me I recommend you try this shaving stick and don\u2019t skimp on the water.", "images": [], "asin": "B0042R25KU", "parent_asin": "B0042R25KU", "user_id": "AENKIQKMMLDWZ5G26DESZDAC7BOQ", "timestamp": 1528822566585, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "One Of My Favorite Shave Soaps.", "text": "Of the traditional great shaving soaps, MWF is the postshave king. Barrister & Mann, L&L, Wholly Kaw, A&E, Italian Extro, there are wonderful soaps out there. They all have great scents and most can match MWF in slickness, cushion and glide. And they\u2019re really close on the post shave. But good old MWF still rules the post shave roost. I love Mitchell\u2019s Wool Fat. I have a Simpson\u2019s Emperor badger brush that was very expensive. Tried and tried to get it to work with MWF, couldn\u2019t get a lather no matter what I tried. I liked the stuff anyway. Then I got a $20 synthetic Plisson knockoff brush. It is the missing link. Loads in 30 seconds, face lathers wonderfully.<br /><br />If you are having trouble lathering MWF do what I did and get a fat synthetic brush. It transforms the Mitchell\u2019s experience.<br /><br />Combined with my favorite razor, the Rockwell 6s set to \u201c3\u201d with a Feather blade, a good aftershave lotion and cologne, I\u2019ve got an awesome shave here.<br /><br />Provides plenty of slickness and cushion like any traditional tallow soap. But the addition of unsaponified lanolin (which also makes it hard to lather) gives this stuff its unparalleled post-shave feel. You will love your soft face after shaving with Mitchell\u2019s and so will your wife, girlfriend or both.<br /><br />Clean off with a hot damp washcloth, then pat dry and hit with a generous amount of Speick aftershave splash. Your pores will immediately tighten up, whiskers will retract, and you will have a perfectly smooth face.<br /><br />If you are going to use Feathers, the samurai sword of DE blades, you need a slick soap like Mitchell\u2019s to keep from cutting yourself. Mitchell\u2019s does its job well.<br /><br />Get some. It might be your favorite too.

I liked that it had eyeliner on the other end, so the two colors/sheens of the eyeliner and stamp are uniform. I did have to try the stamp a few times, as my eyes are big and every now and then, the stamp did not get my whole eye (so there were spaces it did not get to). I'd recommend stamping it with your eye closed. You also have to practice so both sides are at the right angle. I thought the end of the eyeliner brush was pretty thick (making the line more dramatic than usual) but it easily glided on and was very easy to apply. The stamp also was fairly light at times, so I had to go over it again (but it was helpful to have an outline).

The rose scent and the name \"Manilla.\" I assumed it was made in the Philippines, and I'm half Filipino. To my surprise, it's made in Lithuania! It is, however, really quite nice. It's a moisturizer with a scent - not something too often seen these days - but the primary aroma is definitely rose. And I just can't resist that. The scent doesn't linger and follow you around. I really only noticed it until after the cream had been absorbed. The cream itself is very sheer and feels lovely going on. It's absorbed quickly and leaves no greasy residue behind. My skin is quite sensitive and I've experienced no breakout issues. All in all, using this product has been a genuine pleasure, both tactile and sensory. I really just enjoy using it, and my skin feels soft and moist, even in our dry winter air.

Following them, I put four drops (that's what works for me) in my palm, then rub my palms together until they feel warm. Then I pat my face with them, applying the serum all over.

I'm mean it's reeeealy soft, and not oily or greasy at all. It's AMAZING. What really has me addicted is the smell. It's not floral or citrus, or really like anything I can put my finger on. If I had to, I'd say it's faintly sweet\u2026 possibly herbal? Well, whatever it is, it's intoxicating to me. It lingers just a while after the serum dries and I thoroughly enjoy it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Better than the loofa one I have.", "text": "I recently started using one of these with loofa on it. It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Quite happy with this! A great find.", "text": "I had some reservations... I\u2019ve seen the round wood ones around, but never made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too heavy and bulky, but it does not. It\u2019s quite lightweight and because it\u2019s vertical, saves some space. It comes with extensive directions - a nice change - but is really very easy to use and set up. It\u2019s very hot and humid where I live, so I was also worried that adding more humidity to the air would be a bad thing, however, the air that comes out is quite cool, which seems to cool down the area around it (and by \u201cit\u201d, I mean me). I found it very comfortable.<br /><br />I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I love it! You can choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can choose to have your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It\u2019s quite restful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It doesn\u2019t hold a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be inconvenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT\u2019S easy to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn\u2019t be happier with this unit!

In the past, I've used soy wax (Nufree) in salons and this is also a great product because it doesn't bond to the skin making it much less painful and more to the point doesn't cause near the amount of skin irritation.  The Plum Smooth wax does the same thing but with the added bonus of having a more pleasant smell.  I also found that I had even less post-wax irritation with this than with any other wax I've used.  For my at-home waxing I've used consumer available wax strips like Veet, etc.  but these universally are low quality and, in addition to being more painful (even to an experienced waxer like me), cause irritation and sometimes even bruising/broken skin in the more sensitive areas where the skin it thinner.  This product is better than anything else I've tried and here's hoping that the results continue to be as good as the first couple times of use.  As a side note - the other reviewer had negative results and correctly stated that what works for some people may not work with others - in my experience people that have not had good results with soy wax or the Plum Smooth due to irritation it has been because of allergies or incorrect use of the product, but these are generally considered to be much gentler on the skin than any sugar waxes or products you can purchase as a consumer.", "images": [], "asin": "B00KM5K4DG", "parent_asin": "B00KM5K4DG", "user_id": "AFM4MZPOUOGMP6ZSDH2ZJD6SJG5Q", "timestamp": 1441606307000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

This one shaves as close as the more expensive model and has a built-in trimmer. That seems like it should be standard feature and yet my other razor requires me to pop on a different head.  This shaver lasts much longer on a charge and, if the spec is to be believed, can last 90 minutes on continuous use. That's incredible and means you'll likely never need to charge it away from home.  One less charger to carry and one fewer thing to worry about while packing are good things!  And if it does run out on you, there's a quick charge feature that let's you get one shave in with only a min. or two charge. Impressive. Lastly, like many electrics, it's a wet/dry shaver so for those needing that feature it's as versatile as competitive brands.

I watched every video I could find on how to use these clips and they all used the following steps:  (1) Start with clean dry hair.  Move the top layer of hair out of the way and take a section of hair from underneath.  Put the clips in with some looseness against the scalp.  They should not be tight against your scalp.  Make sure the clip part is turned to the outside and the hair is pulled straight away from scalp.  (2) apply heat gently to hair using medium to high heat and low air flow (3) apply cold air using hair dryer or wait for hair to cool naturally.  Do not leave the clip in too long if you are letting it cool naturally or it may leave kinks.  (3) Take out the clips and comb through with fingers, ruffling slightly to break up any visible kinks.  Blend in top layer so any kinks still visible will be hidden underneath.

My husband was reluctant at first to add another step to his morning routine, until he tried the product.  First off, the wash and rinse smell so much better than the generic men\u2019s 3 in 1 he had been using from Target.  Oftentimes men\u2019s products have a tendency to smell overpoweringly chemically, but these just smell fresh and clean, while still imparting a masculine scent in general.  The essential oils used are peppermint, eucalyptus, and lemongrass, and do not smell like a cheap cologne, which is usually typical for a mens wash.  I, as the wife, have noticed a change in the positive in my husband\u2019s beard since using the Wild Willie\u2019s products.  I have always loved his beard, but it smells better and is more manageable with the introduction of these products into his regular wash routine.  Before it was super rough and unruly, and now it feels softer and lays flatter.  I love that the Beard Wash and Beard Rinse are sulfate free, as this is a priority in our household.

In my opinion no not really but I like the fabrics these come in as they\u2019re all super cute. I personally LOVE the black velvet as it matches most everything. I like using these over standard rubber bands as they don\u2019t kink my hair like a rubber band would. I have thick and long hair (hangs to the middle of my bra)  and these hold my hair up in a top knot or ponytail pretty well. I have tested using it while doing Pilates and I had to adjust it a couple of times but for normal activity it holds up great. Finally it does stretch out to accommodate thick hair and wrap a couple times around but it returns to<br />its original shape and doesn\u2019t stay stretched out (I\u2019ve had that issue with elastic band scrunchi where they get stretched out and unusable).

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The power of peppermint! (And other natural stuff thats cool i guess)", "text": "I've had a beard for 3 years.  It's pretty thick and heavy and tends to grow in thickness/volume and not length.  It's more like a face afro, if you will.  Overall it's a pretty healthy beard but I decided to give Wild Willie's a shot since I like their beard butter so much.<br /><br />First off I when the bottle arrived i really thought they werr small.  So for $30 i wasnt sure if it was money well spent.  Time will tell.<br />Second I love the peppermint smell.  I don't feel it's overpowering at all and find it refreshing in the morning.  The shampoo lathers really well and a dime size goes a long way, even in my thick beard.  We do have soft water FYI, so that usually helps any soap/shampoo lathers better.  It feels like it cleans really well with out drying my beard out.<br /><br />The conditioner goes a long way as well. About a dime to penny size drop is all I need depending on how thick my beard has gotten.  I let the conditioner sit for about 5 minutes to let it really work in.  It leaves a nice cool tingling feeling on my face and has the great peppermint smell.  When I rinse it, it doesn't leave a heavy conditioner feel and rinses cleanly.<br /><br />Overall I think it does a good job.  It leaves my beard moisturized and not dried out and somewhat soft.  Definitely keeps my beard looking healthy and shiny.  In fact, while I actually get a lot of compliments on having a really great beard; once I started using these products I got so many more compliments. Now, that may just be a coincidence.<br /><br />Overall I'm so far satisfied.  Both shampoo and conditioner have lasted about a month with less than half used.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works really well, although don't delude yourself that it won't hurt.", "text": "I'm a tweezing/waxing maniac. Although it does hurt to wax, it doesn't suck as much as having to shave all the time, so I prefer it over shaving. The downside to that is that it is so expensive. In my town, an underarm wax can cost $22 plus tip, and since the hair will grow back at different times you may end up wishing for another wax just a week later. You also have to wait until it's long enough too. Since I was tired of the cost of waxing and I don't mind the pain of waxing or plucking, I thought an epilator would be a good buy. I did a lot of research on each type and finally settled on this one about 6 months ago based on the positive reviews. I made the right choice, for sure, and it has paid for itself at least 5 times over by now.<br />Pros:<br />*It is actually better not to let the hair grow long, so that means you don't have to be hairy for long periods of time<br />*You can do it at any given time, if there is anything to pull, which is way better than a once-per month trip to the waxer's shop.<br />*It doesn't hurt as bad once you are consistent with it, just like with waxing.<br />*It is fairly easy to clean and easy to recharge<br />*The flashlight is a great tool to help see those hairs you would miss just off the ceiling lights.<br />*You can use it almost anywhere, or anywhere you have help from another pair of unwary hands. Bikini line, chin, upper lip, underarm, leg, arm, you name it. My underarms and bikini line are my favorite places to use it.<br />*You can use it in the shower<br />*The battery lasts pretty long, like an hour<br />Cons:<br />*If you try to give yourself a brazilian wax with it by yourself, you are gonna have a bad time. I tried and failed. Luckily, the top part came off before it could do any damage, so it was really just a bit scary. It jammed when that happened, and wouldn't turn back on, but I just plugged it in for a charge and it was back to normal.<br />*It hurts pretty bad. As opposed to waxing, which takes it all off in one go, it pulls hairs one at a time like tweezing, but at a fast pace. That means there is a lot of breath holding and holding of skin to keep it all tight because you don't know when or how many hairs it will find and pull out. I suggest taking 600mg of Ibuprofen a half hour before you intend to do it... or maybe a few glasses of wine if you'd rather not use traditional drugs.<br />*The hair will fly EVERYWHERE, but where else would it go, I guess?", "images": [], "asin": "B00AX3YNPC", "parent_asin": "B00AX3YNPC", "user_id": "AFDPEVHIDXDRQB2GWK44IR3ZCVPA", "timestamp": 1388386083000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}

I eyebrows with a nice shape but they are very thin from years of plucking, and very light from sun exposure and my natural coloring.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "First (almost) electric razor", "text": "Just had my first shave with this. I've used two electric razors in my life. One was an already ancient one that my dad had, about 40 years ago. Ripped each of the few hairs in my face out one by one. Then an early Norelco 3-head circular job, about 30 years ago that either sucked or I didn't know how to use. Very even stubble was the result of that. Hence my refusal to try one until my memories have faded.<br /><br />This review reflects one shave - not a long term review.<br /><br />I'm impressed. It's slower than I expected, I half-thought I could activate an app on my phone or something and I would be shaved (I'm joking!). It's pretty darn close to a manual 5-blade fresh razor.<br /><br />Here are the conditions under which I'm reporting:<br />- I'm 62, so my skin isn't exactly taut on my face.<br />- Not a heavy beard, I need to shave every day now, but not until I was about 35.<br />- This shave was with 2 days of stubble.<br />- I usually shave in the shower, using Braille to tell when a patch is smooth.<br /><br />I used the razor dry. The manual said to charge the razor before first use, but it came out of the box showing 100% charge so I went for it. The manual also says not to apply too much pressure, so I was tentative at first. It helps to apply fair pressure while moving the razor SLOWLY through that fungus that seems to grow constantly on our faces.<br /><br />Stretching my skin with other-handed fingers in most spots helped. I used a mirror just to watch the progress, but you can use your sonic sensors, AKA ears, to tell when the blades are and aren't removing stubble. I don't think a mirror is at all necessary, YMMV.<br /><br />While I've been writing this, I've used Braille again to check on the usual trouble spots - I can just grab the mower and run it over the rough bits while I'm doing this. You could do this easily while driving somewhere - no risk of a small knick, and the aural attention that it takes doesn't really distract from driving.<br /><br />I didn't notice when I ordered this razor that it came with an extra foil. Nice detail, since the foil is easy to damage being thin (as it should be). The kit comes with a carrying bag, which is nice to keep everything together while traveling. I would find a small rigid container for the extra foil if I were to travel with that - it could easily get bent in the carrying bag knocking around with all the bits. The foil is too long for the old canisters from film cameras, but a cut-off from a roll of Xmas paper would suffice.<br /><br />The grip is comfortable and makes the shaving head easy to maneuver. The carrying bag contains everything in a small package - I'm a Cardinal (Archbishops and above don't shave) in the Church of Small Luggage and I will happily carry this instead of a couple of manual razors on any trip.<br /><br />Finally (applause erupts from the crowd),  very nearly close shave as a manual razor, a little slower than a manual razor, works very well dry (absolutely unlike a manual razor, though I've tried that also and it does sort of work).<br /><br />Buy it. Try it.", "images": [], "asin": "B07KRJB3FF", "parent_asin": "B07KRJB3FF", "user_id": "AFXVCEEIAVRQV4HHOUFBKDPD747Q", "timestamp": 1547505486496, "helpful_vote": 23, "verified_purchase": true}

The drawbacks are pain(no problem for me but if you are too sensitive consider using a xylocaine gel) and very very time consuming to do large areas. A trick I have found that helps lessen time needed and pain and scarring is take some instant glue and tip the tip of the stillet inside. After it dries use some tweezers to remove the glue from the very tip of the stillet.

There was not a defective bow in the package.  They were all perfect well made bows.  The bows came in a plastic reusable zip storage bag.  I cut the rubber band portion off or either peel back the center part of the bow to remove the rubber band so that I can then stitch the bow onto the cat collars.  My dog has about 20 different cat collars with bows & flowers that I have sewn onto the collars.  Some of the Blueberry brand cat collars came with bows already on them.  I put cat collars on her because she stalks creatures in the yard like a cat.  The bell will alert birds & also the breakaway collar will prevent her from getting chocked if she becomes tangled in vegetation.  She is a very sweet dog in the house, but she becomes a bloodthirsty killer in the yard.  She must have some terrier in her bloodline.  She creeps across the yard on her belly like a cat stalking prey.  My Jack Russell Terrier killed anything that moved.  I hardly have any lizards or green frogs (they make her ill for 24hrs after she bites them, but she can't resist mauling them again & again) left in my yard.  I try to rescue the creatures, but she is very fast in order to catch a frog or a lizard.  She now has taken to stalking the house geckos (invasive species in the southeast) at night that live in my garage, but they stay up high on the walls where she can't reach them.  Anyway, the bows are perfect & work very well for sewing onto pet collars.  I am sure that they would work just as well in a small child's hair. They are small.  Just under 2 inches in length.

On a full charge the clippers will roughly 2 hours and are small enough to just throw in your toiletry bag.<br /><br />The trimmer itself has a nice shape to it and is comfortable to hold in your hand.  It also has a fairly nice heft to it, not too light but not heavy.  It feels like you are really holding on to something though.<br /><br />The head is fairly wide which can be a plus in that it doesn't take long at all to trim an area but can also be a bit of a minus depending on the shape of your face if you are trimming your beard.  The action is smooth and has a nice gliding feel to it, even if you don't use any attachments and just use the trimmer head itself.<br /><br />It would have been nice if the Maybuy came with some sort of carrying case to put it, the attachments and the charging cord in but it doesn't unfortunately.

The comb itself is of high quality and comes packaged very nicely. It has an on/off button and six heat settings depending on the weight, curl and thickness of your hair. My hair is color treated, slightly wavy with medium thickness so I used the middle setting (3 to 4). The device heated up in under a minute and is cool to the touch as the heating element is not exposed to the outer edge of the comb. I found that starting from the underside of my hair gave me more control than just combing it down my head. I was able to straighten my whole head in under 5 minutes. I love that I cannot burn myself which is my main complaint about hair straightening irons. Also, I was able to get my hair straight without hearing it sizzle as I did not need as much heat. I am posting picture of the device, my blown dry hair before and my straight hair afterwards. I really like this comb better than the many other methods I have tried.

It\u2019s a beautiful color, not crazily oversaturated like some blonde cosplay wigs turn out. It has a very natural vibe.<br />-My picture comes from AFTERa cut and styled it. I should have taken a photo from the get-go but the wig is actually pretty long. The hair fell nearly tiny abdomen and so I had to take about 5-7 inches off. With this wig, I decided to cut it whilst wearing it (rather than put it on a wig head stand) and I used my sharpest pair of scissors to shear it up to where I wanted it. This technique worked PERFECTLY. Since there is already wave in the wig, shearing helped keep the movement and avoided that choppy look you can sometimes get when you lop off length.<br />-ponytail piece is hair attached to a clip. It is incredibly easy to attach to the wig and isn\u2019t incredibly heavy either. I had to take off quite a bit of length on the ponytail piece because it nearly touched my shoulder. I decided not to take it too too short simply because I wanted to ensure the clip kept good coverage and I wanted to make sure there was enough hair to hide the purple bow piece that I made.<br />-the bangs are a perfect length; no crazy eye pokeage and they held really easy after a spritz of hair spray<br />-the wig itself seems sometimes like, \u201coh no it\u2019s statidlc and maybe tangling\u201d but you can literally just run your fingers through it and it returns to form.<br /><br />This was a great purchase.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Purchased this item in Marshall's for $6.99", "text": "So as I have stated in previous skin care  product reviews, I am EXTREMELY vain. That is probably due to the fact that I suffer with Adult Acne. Never had acne until I reached my mid 20's. So as a fair skin woman in her mid 30's my focus is to lessen the severity of my outbreaks, and to keep my skin looking youthful and CLEAR! Like other women in my predicament I have spend loads of money on what seems like millions of products sometimes they work, then after a couple of months they cease to have any effect. So besides incorporating multivitamins into my life (B complex, Flaxseed oil, MSM, DMAE, etc) which I take pretty consistently, I drink plenty of water or as much as I can take, eat fairly healthy (no soda, no juice, no candy, no chips, little to no fast food) and of course I exercise. All these things will play into how healthy your skin will and can be! So on a recent trip to South Carolina, I ran into a Marshall's and I always check out the skincare section. Now within the last couple of months my skin will begin to clear up completely then BAM I will get a medium red nodule, or inflamed whitehead.... UGH! And though you are not suppose too I always pop mine to relieve the pain and pressure. I always do it with clean hands, and typical wash my face with my 10% sulfur soap I purchased here on Amazon. So when I ran into this Brightening product for $6.99 it caught my eye. With all the sulfur and scrubs and acne drying products my skin was looking pretty dull and kinda flaky. I needed something to help diminish my acne scars, moisturize and smooth out my skin... and the fact that this product claimed to help with anti aging was the icing on the cake... so I took it home and gave it a whirl.... its been about 2 1/2 weeks I have used this product 2x a day each day as it is not heavy and provides the extra moisture I need. I have noticed significant difference in the color and size of my scars. my skin feels smooth and soft. I feel good about this product sofar I have had no adverse reactions to this serum. With any product it takes a keen eye and diligence to becoming successful in your skincare goals. I will see how I feel about this product once I finish the bottle. If this product continues to show me positive gradual results I might purchase another product as this is cheap and effective. As we head into a new year I am looking to go more organic in my skincare products and spend alil less than I have this year and previous years.", "images": [], "asin": "B00AD3O3RU", "parent_asin": "B00AD3O3RU", "user_id": "AFXSOMNTUABGLUZLMBWHTUKNVTRQ", "timestamp": 1388515408000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

They are small a great size to put in your purse, book bag, glove box or even your pocket.  They are each 3.9&#34; X 1.5&#34; X 0.5&#34;.  Each bottle is 0.5 oz.  They of course came in the super cute burlap looking drawstring sac like bag.<br /><br />It is very easy to use and self-explanatory you just spray the product into the palm of your hand and then rub your hands together until it is all absorbed.  I absolutely love the citrus smell and it was all absorbed into the skin very quickly and did not leave any kind of residue or sticky feeling on my hands like a lot of the other brands do.

I've had it now for two weeks and here's what I think...<br /><br />* The vacuum is great, period. When shaving with my Norelco T900, the shavings would fly all over the place --- in the sink, behind the faucet, in between the handles of the faucet, and on the floor. With the vacuum set on low, I barely see any clippings now! Now, my wife doesn't get mad any more!<br /><br />* The height adjustment can be easily set, and unlike other reviews mention, I haven't accidentally changed the setting without knowing.<br /><br />* The clipper works great and easily cuts/trims without any effort. This is an upgrade from my T900.<br /><br />* Battery holds its charge pretty well. You can use it with a power cord also when the battery is low.<br /><br />* The smaller trimmer is a now a separate attachment. My T900 has it attached to the trimmer, and it can be popped up or down when needed. To me, this is a downgrade as it is not as convenient.<br /><br />* The parts seem somewhat delicate. I try to be careful as to not cause damage.<br /><br />Overall, the price is good, it works well, and I'm glad I purchased it, and would recommend it to all.", "images": [], "asin": "B000FEF1V4", "parent_asin": "B000FEF1V4", "user_id": "AGJJRF6REVHJ4MNHG6AMCRBYYNZA", "timestamp": 1194864647000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

That piece alone holds as much as the Glossybox box I was using but takes up less room and makes it easier to see and get my hands on the things I use most ofter. If I could buy the drawers separately, I would so that I could organize the rest of my manicure stuff.<br /><br />I also love that the bottom drawer is nearly twice as deep as the middle drawer. I don't have to worry about thicker compacts or powder boxes tripping up the drawer.<br /><br />This organizer is made of very durable and substantial material. It feels substantial as well and it holds a lot more than the other organizer. Now I can have a drawer for each type of makeup.

The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.<br /><br />I've been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn't a surprise for my skin. It was as close and comfy as I'd expect from a Norelco.<br /><br />The real revelation was the sound. The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black & Decker DustBuster. The Reflex Plus is so quiet, you can actually hear the cutters slice off the whiskers and then fall silent on the next pass over the same area. This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn't nearby. You could actually shave by the sound alone!<br /><br />A somewhat poignant note: Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind. When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie. Still, I miss seeing the words \"MADE IN HOLLAND\" on the bottom of every Norelco I've owned.<br /><br />Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.", "images": [], "asin": "B00009RB0X", "parent_asin": "B00009RB0X", "user_id": "AHCTG4AAR44R5GL7O7HOMMLMRHCQ", "timestamp": 1123160622000, "helpful_vote": 117, "verified_purchase": false}

She uses it daily for mainly combing and straightening her hair. Gets hot quick, less than 30 secs. Used on long around 12-18 inch black, thick, full set of hair. Used after showering with damp hair mostly and works fine. Uses it as a brush/comb. Steam is used when her hair is dry. We had a hard time finding distilled water with all the shortages. So this review took us a month to complete. Normal everyday use is great on her thick rebellious hair. We don't use the steam as often but works great when hair is dry and needs moisture to brush. Great accessory or upgrade to your regular combing/brushing. Some parts are hard to get too, without a mirror or hard reach areas, like behind your head. Hope this helps.

That is basically the whole bottle... so if you can afford to spend $30 on every shampoo, maybe it will work better for you. I used one pump on the top of my hair, one pump on the bottom and then after I rinsed it out, one more pump to leave on my ends. The first two days it made my hair look supermodel perfect... after that, it was so disgustingly greasy that I couldn't handle it. I started to work back a shampoo into my routine here and there to help with that- but now every single time I use it, its nothing but grease and weighed down matted down hair.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A beautiful, natural, dewy finish..", "text": "Let me start by saying, I did NOT order this from Amazon.  I ordered it from Sephora.  The reviews here regarding whether this product was a fake or not made me a little leery.  So, I'm reviewing the real Josie Maran Vibrancy foundation and not the Amazon version, real or not.<br /><br />As usual, I ordered the lightest shade, RG5.  It's a nearly perfect match.  It's described as being for fair skin with neutral undertones.  I typically prefer foundations with pink undertones, but this actually worked really well for me.<br /><br />The consistency is on the thin, runny side, which isn't surprising since oil is an ingredient.  Having said that, this foundation sits on the skin so beautifully.  It looks like real skin.  It's definitely not a matte foundation, so if that's your preference, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation gives you more luminous, dewy-looking skin.  I don't typically care for dewy foundations, but again, I was surprised to like this one.  It just made my skin look healthy and plump.  It didn't look at all heavy, which is great because it didn't settle into my fine lines.  I did notice it took a while to set.  Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.  It's a very specific look.", "images": [], "asin": "B01J4P4VH4", "parent_asin": "B01J4P4VH4", "user_id": "AGFHHZIEFIIXJZKWRCLKISPPFGWQ", "timestamp": 1515024131702, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Takes a lot of work to look good...", "text": "3.5 stars<br /><br />I have many thoughts on this wig.  We ordered this to compliment my daughter's Mad Hatter Halloween costume and honestly, it looked like a hot mess when it arrived.  The bangs were going everywhere, the curls were tangled, there was no part...it was awful.<br /><br />My daughter, who is 12, has long, VERY thick blonde hair.  When the wig arrived, we tried it on with her hair down to make sure it fit.  It did.  Fast forward to Halloween...I braided her hair and pulled it into a knot at the back of her head.  Lo and behold, the wig wouldn't fit...it just kept sliding off her head.  That was my mistake...I should have tested it with a bun when it arrived.  Having said that, my daughter is incredibly petite...her doctor predicts she won't surpass 5' when she's full grown  Obviously, her head isn't that large.  My point?  If you're an adult or are purchasing this for a teen or big child, it likely won't fit.  I finally had to put her hair in a low bun at the nape of her neck to make it work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because her natural hair was so low, we couldn't do the up-do we had planned because her bun showed if we did.  We ended up leaving it down, brushing it out, putting bobby pins in strategic places to help it frame her face and to contain it, and then I hair sprayed it in place.  Styling was especially difficult because the wig is sparse.  It's a lot of work to hide the netting underneath.  The netting is a yellow-beige color and stands out like bright white against the purple and teal.  We finally got it looking decent though, and she actually got many compliments on it throughout the evening, hence the higher star rating despite all the complaints.<br /><br />Once the wig was brushed and styled, the waves looked beautiful.  Just don't buy this expecting it to look great out of the box.  It won't.  It takes work.", "images": [], "asin": "B00UHEK7UW", "parent_asin": "B00UHEK7UW", "user_id": "AGFHHZIEFIIXJZKWRCLKISPPFGWQ", "timestamp": 1509559362409, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

It smells amazing, the lather is plentiful and silky, and I can genuinely say that my hair does feel a bit thicker.

Don't get me wrong...it's not an Earth-shattering change, but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars is because every single shampoo bottle I have ever purchased has been faulty.  They leak, the pump either breaks or doesn't work from the start, and the plastic is flimsy.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Better then most at this price point, depends on which one you get", "text": "So it's honestly not bad at this price point. It sheds a bit but all units have some shedding. For the mix brown I give 4 stars.The face front is about 2 inches and is meant to be cut and plucked for a natural look. I did neither in the photo. I just folded it under the the front as I'm afraid that cutting will make it look lifted in the front and obviously show it's a wig without some glue to put it down. The color is not exactly what I wanted. I was hoping it would be a darker brown. It's kinda a mousey brown and alittle strange in my opinion. It will need to be restyle in the front as some waves/curls flattened out by how it was packed in transport. The part is both a plastic fake skin and a mesh on top. You can see the mesh upon close examination. Makeup might help to conceal this.... Or make it worse. What I did like was the fullness and length. The weft was not too easy to be seen even when pulling hair apart. This is good compared to other brands where the wefts are often very visible, especially in the back and crown of a unit. Because the simulated scalp is narrow, you won't be able to change the part. It's also a bit flat near the part so it's gonna take some work to give a bit of volume. I would have enjoyed this much more had the color been a rich brown and if the scalp was a bit more realistic. Would I wear in public? Probably not. Would this be good for photo shoots or costumes ? yes. Would I buy other colors from this brand? Yes and I haven't done that with other brands on Amazon. For the purple ombre: I give 3 stars. It doesn't have the lace in front. This is more pure costume. The black is very shiney and the front of wig where the part is shows a bit of the black backing for construction. If it laid more flat and had the lace I would have given the purple ombre 4 stars. Dull the shiney with some powder like dry shampoo or maybe even dark eyeshadow. The fake scalp is actually better on the purple ombre compared to the brown mix. The ombre for the blonde is also a 4 star. Hair at the crown is a bit flat but the rest of the style is beautiful. The brown to blonde has the 2 inch lace like the long brown one. It's not as full on the head but you don't see the wefts unless you pull it apart a bit.  I feel the color is much more realistic. Hair feels pretty good for a synthetic. Note if you play too much , it will get a knotty feel. Again, good for photos. Some people might actually wear it daily but I don't know if it took take daily abuse. Length is great.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ILx3h4CrL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url":

The unit shed pretty bad just by touching it though. The hair was shiney but powder should control that. The length was there. It had one spot near the bangs that looked like someone fried it. And that would be hard to conceal. The bangs looked nicer then most but it just wasn't for me. Fake scalp also not best I've seen but concealer would probably fix that. The top had no volume and I don't mean amount of hair. It was slicked down really tight. I tried to shake it a bit with my fingers to see if it would gain some life but it didn't, plus a bunch of hair fell out.  This super flat look near the fake scalp and with a mid part that cannot be moved is just gonna make me look like the Amish.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Recommended by my dentist!", "text": "My dentist recommended I purchased a water flosser but the one he was selling in his office was almost $100! I looked them up and found that they were all considerably cheaper online. I\u2019m extremely happy with this one! The best feature is that it\u2019s cordless (with the exception of when it\u2019s charging, of course). I\u2019ve had mine for a few weeks and I\u2019ve only had to plug it in once so the charge is lasting. For those of you who\u2019ve never used a water flosser before, they can be powerful and messy (with water getting everywhere) so it\u2019s best to keep and use them in the shower so that the water is confined/contained inside the shower during use. This was actually my dentists recommendation \u2013 so this being a cordless flosser was very important! I usually get about 3 flosses in before having to refill the water reservoir (which is very simple). This one does come with several tips so I tried them all after settling on one. I think having several different options is nice so that you can find the pressure and kind of tip that works best for you and meets your own unique needs. Overall, I think this water flosser is great. It does exactly what I need it to do and I got it for a fraction of the price from the dentists office. I would confidently recommend it to others! For anyone looking to buy water flossers, I hope my review is helpful to you!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlaAOSKnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlaAOSKnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YlaAOSKnL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pyf9YZO6L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pyf9YZO6L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pyf9YZO6L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pIWfj104L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pIWfj104L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pIWfj104L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qoAB0sAEL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qoAB0sAEL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qoAB0sAEL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07W11NLFS", "parent_asin": "B07W11NLFS", "user_id": "AGZM7K3XER7QIXHLUUZ62Q47DN4Q", "timestamp": 1576421263652, "helpful_vote": 32, "verified_purchase": true}

I have been going to a professional for months now and when the 2020 pandemic began and all service providers closed up shop,  I wasn't sure how I would deal with unwanted facial hair.  Where other methods of hair removal can encourage stronger hair regrowth I did not want to regress.  Then I found this!  I have had this product several weeks now and am very happy with it.  I wish I had found this earlier.  Not only can I do a treatment whenever I want, I am able to target hairs when they first appear as opposed to waiting for an appointment.  It is very easy to use.  I was afraid I would be unable to target the follicle in the right spot but that has not been a problem.  It has a high pitch buzz when the current is delivered to the follicle.  Most of the time the sound is my only indication that anything is happening.  I do not find this painful.  I can tell it is working because when I go to remove the hair it comes out with no effort.  I do keep the power at the highest setting except for the delicate area above the upper lip.  That can be a painful area at home or at the salon.<br /><br />My only complaint with the product is that the tweezers included are useless.  Just use your own.<br />I bent the stylist at first so I did order extras to have in case that happens again... so far so good as I haven't ruined another.  I don't think that is a product flaw as it must be very delicate to do the job right... just be careful.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with electrolysis, do not expect that one shot will forever kill a hair.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "My hubby likes his new shaver", "text": "My husband has complained about shaving irritating his skin, so when I saw this shaver I ordered one for him. Here is what he had to say after using it:<br /><br />I've used Norelco shavers for years, but never a \"wet\" system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver. When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner. This was no problem following the easy to read instruction manual.<br /><br />To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button. This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads. Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver. I found that I use three pumps of conditioner while shaving: one for each side of my face and one for my neck.<br /><br />Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin. Because of this, in recent years I've starting shaving every other day. So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men's would normally be. The shaver has no problem coping with this. It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs. However, it begins to have problems with three days of growth.<br /><br />I also have a mustache and goatee, which has always caused me to use a razor to shave along its edge. The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry skin.<br /><br />The shaver also comes with a beard trimming device. Just snap off the triple shave head and replace it with the trimmer. (Conditioner cannot be used when the trimmer is installed.) The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless. It just doesn't want to cut any hairs. But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.<br /><br />I also find the conditioner application button is in a position that I want to place my fingers when using the shaver, so occasionally I'll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner. A pretty minor issue.<br /><br />The Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I'm blind as a bat without my glasses on.<br /><br />I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception: \u00ad there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin. I like my new shaver.", "images": [], "asin": "B000UK2VRK", "parent_asin": "B000UK2VRK", "user_id": "AFWBLJNGV5OEUKBNXAEMPMNGLJWQ", "timestamp": 1215984334000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn\u2019t touch.<br /><br />I\u2019ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.  I think this makes a good every day primer.  And since I still use a separate moisturizer that has spf I don\u2019t have to worry about this not having it.

The length is perfect too- not too long.<br /><br />I lightly buffed the top of these and painted them w regular nail polish. If I polish without buffing, they can crinkle a bit - I have not tried gel yet tho, and that probably will work out w a clear top if I want to keep the white tip look. Even without polish, the buffed look just looks like a beautiful pink matte polish, as if I had painted them that way on purpose.

I could see that to change up dark hair or to get a strong/intense color tone, you'd need to pile this stuff on, and I think that's where this gets a bad rap. Yes, you can glob this on to higher opacity and change your dark colored hair to the color shown in the jar.

I typically put it on after I towel dry from the shower, then wait a few minutes while I brush my teeth. The key to a non-streaky appearance is to use a mitt!!! This one came with a soft velour mitt and it works wonders. I still get spots that I miss but that is due to user error - and it would be easier to spot these gaps if this tanner was tinted a little bit more. I wouldn't take a full star off for that but I would love it even more if it was easier to see where I had already put it on.<br /><br />It arrived super fast and sealed, not leaking out like with many other products.<br /><br />It lasts only about 2-3 days, and it's a lot thinner than other tanners - it's not a cream, much more of a lotion and a tiny bit too liquidy at that.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "OMG! I'm in LOVE!!!", "text": "Ok...I'm going to try to not write a novel here, but I am sooo in love with these polishes!!!  I read a ton on reviews on these peel off polishes and finally chose these not expecting a whole lot. I have 100% no complaints!!! But I will say that I guess it all depends on what you are wanting out of your nail polish. If you are wanting it to last like it lasts on artificial nails... this is not for you. If you are wanting options and to not have to deal with nail polish remover...THIS IS FOR YOU!!!<br /><br />I have loved painting my nails and having polished nails since a kid. I've always hated nail polish remover. I have thin nails and can't change my polish often because nail polish remover dries my nails out and makes them even weaker and it stinks...even nail polish stinks for that matter.<br />To make the polish last I've always added a top coat about every day or two and I've learned how to do touch ups that hardly show when the polish on tip of the nail (natural nails) chipped or wore away, so that I didn't have to use acetone any more often than necessary. But it was really self defeating because the more polish I had on, the more acetone I had to use to remove it.<br />So anyway...I got these little gems in...they are small....but then again, when you compare the price to buying regular polish ( I buy OPI normally ) and the fact that you are getting several colors of these for the price you'd pay for 1 or 2 bottles of decent regular polish, it's not a bad deal at all.<br />I tried them right away and<br />#1...they are hardly smell at all! I don't smell them unless I actually hold my nails or the bottle to my nose to smell them.<br />#2...the polish went on fine. It's a little thick, but it settles down smooth as it dries.<br />#3 I love some of the colors and some will be just for having fun, but they are fun t play with. 5 colors are opaque and 4 are transparent, so they are fun mixing and matching. I like using the transparent ones as top coats on the opaque ones.<br />#4 They lasted about 3 days with no chips and very very little edge wear (with the daily addition of a top coat for shine) until I couldn't stand it any longer and had to try to peel them off. Some of the reviews said they were hard to peel off, but I had no problem at all. And all but one came off in one full piece! Amazing!!! So easy and NO ACETONE!!! And the other thing I like is that with regular polish, I would sometimes try and peel of as much as I could before using the acetone and some would come off but my nail always seemed super dry under the polish even when it was peeled off. That is not the case with these at all. My nails were not dry at all. They were still healthy and not dry at all!!!<br />Oh and the BONUS ....since they peel off, any polish that gets on to your skin peels off easy too after it dries. :)", "images": [], "asin": "B07N36NMKJ", "parent_asin": "B07N36NMKJ", "user_id": "AGQXE4KNPXLJG22Q2FQZJVW3JE6A", "timestamp": 1583624197300, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great eye pillow for relaxation, headaches and puffy eyes!", "text": "I've been looking for something just like this, so when I was given the opportunity to review it, at a discounted cost, I jumped at it.<br /><br />First off, I wouldn't really consider this an eye mask for sleeping. It's great to place over your eyes or forehead for relaxing, headaches, itchy/watery/puffy eyes but without a strap to keep it on your face, I wouldn't sleep with it on.<br /><br />When I first took it out of the package, I was met with a powerful smell of lavender, so I knew that this definitely had enough potency to last for a while.<br /><br />Heat: After it was heated, the smell was initially little overpowering but after a while, it faded. It says to lightly spritz the mask and then heat it for 30 seconds in the microwave, which I did, but since it didn't feel hot enough, I put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds and, for me, that was the perfect temperature.<br /><br />Cold: I tried freezing it to use on my eyes, since my allergies have been killing me this season and my eyes have been quite puffy and itchy, and I must say that I was rather pleased. It was cool, but definitely not too cold to place directly on my skin/eyes to soothe them. This time around, I could barely smell the lavender.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product but I wish the company had also enclosed a nice bag to seal the eye mask in when you're done using it. In the directions, it says to keep it in a sealed bag to help keep the lavender smell last longer so I had assumed that they would have included one with it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but it does not change my opinion of the product.", "images": [], "asin": "B00X04M31C", "parent_asin": "B00X04M31C", "user_id": "AEFEPQYRCUM5EIE32QEMG6UJPVUQ", "timestamp": 1448291220000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Saw the reviews & gave it a shot. First off let me state that I\u2019m a full coverage type of girl. I have freckles, discoloration & some scars I like hiding when I do wear makeup. I never thought I would even consider something light weight or sheer. But now as a mom, barely have time for my glam makeup, & wanted something to protect my aging skin this stuff is great! IM 26 but want to start taking care of my skin better. I\u2019m usually the color porcelain but wanted something with color. The natural glow gave me that sun kissed glow without looking orange. Non shimmery what-so ever. Matt but non drying, no oily texture. Gave me such a natural glow. GORG! I wore this all day for Easter at the park (never thought I wouldn\u2019t wear foundation to a family event!) & got tons of compliments how I look refreshed. I\u2019m glowing & my skin hasn\u2019t looked better! I will 100% be buying this for as long as they continue this product!<br /><br />2 MONTH UPDATE: Still am amazing product! Use it almost everyday now. I even tried it under my foundation& works wonderfully! I swear it made my foundation look better. Like others posted, the pumped stopped working on me. I now have to open the container to get the product out. Not that big of a deal but a bummer.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "the BEST for anything from subtle shimmer to hard chrome", "text": "This palette has become one of my favorite nail tools. I've been using it mostly on acrylic dip powder, but have also used it on top of traditional polish with a clear coat on top. if you apply a light/thin layer (or on dip powder base that has NOT been buffed), it adds a subtle shimmer. If you apply it more thickly AND buff it with the eyeshadow-type applicator, you can achieve a solid chrome look that's really fun as well. I enjoy putting it on all my nails, or just on one nail for a fun accent look that still matches my overall color scheme. I've also enjoyed using it on a relatively plain nail for a fine-textured glitter look while other nails have full-texture glitter.

I've compared eyemakeup removal by using this on one side and my liquid \"eye makeup remover\" on the other, and the two sides typically look nearly the same, though I look a teensy bit better on this side... so if I follow up by removing the rest of the mascara the usual way, I usually only get a teensy bit of grey on the Q-tip (rather than the usual solid black I get when I haven't pre-treated with this cloth).

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "another solid epilator from Braun (plus no more underarm bumps!)", "text": "Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:<br />* Removes smaller hairs (0.5mm) than older models, so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back<br />* The \"massagers\" on the epilation head really do help<br />* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won't work)... and I must say that using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort, although it's a bit harder to notice stray hairs<br />* You can't use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower!) but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you'll have to toss the unit)<br />* I wish this included a trimming head like other models, for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack (they have to be 7 mm or shorter before this will really pull them out)<br />* This doesn't include an attachment for facial hair like some do (which is OK)... just make sure that your epilator is clean if you're going to use it on your face, because otherwise it will make you break out<br />* The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed<br />* The exfoliating brush is a nice touch, because epilating frequently leads to ingrown hairs. It says to use it a day or two before epilating, and it's super-gentle... almost feels like it's not doing anything, but I found it's more effective and more comfortable (if more slow) than just using a loofah. The \"wait 2 days\" advice is good because otherwise your skin gets sensitive<br /><br />And some thoughts on epilation in general:<br />* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it's very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren't bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.)<br />* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you'll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back but are still too small to get. It's less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren't really visible. So if you think someone's going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don't bother doing anything for a month or so, you'll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.<br />* Remember that the exfoliation is important to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don't turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you'll have to do that anyway. And this unit's exfoliator is more gentle than a loofah<br />* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they'll banish them but don't? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it's fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time", "images": [], "asin": "B00AX3YNPC", "parent_asin": "B00AX3YNPC", "user_id": "AEGZUGS74AIXKND3LQEAZAS4NVNA", "timestamp": 1366578528000, "helpful_vote": 65, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Heats up quickly.", "text": "[[VIDEOID:1998f82c98c1bbb520f99c753a936492]] The latest hair craze if the hair straightening brush, and I will admit to having one, using it, and loving it. The only thing that I have disliked about it is that it is a little heavy, and since my hair is super curly, I have to run it through my hair a lot, and my hand does get tired. Even if I'm rotating hands, it still takes a really long time. Even though my hair is short, it's just really thick and curly. So I don't love straightening it, and my go-to when I am straightening my hair had been the straightening brush. But I actually like this one better.<br />The LED screen is very easy to read, even while in use. The hair brush bristles are very nice, and seemingly durable as none of them broke off while I was straightening my hair. And again, it's not as heavy as the hair straightening brushes that has been the latest craze.<br />Its very user friendly, and it heats up super fast. The rotating cord is a nice feature, I don't think that I would ever straighten my hair if I had to constantly untangle the cord. That's just another frustration that doesn't even need to be added on, in my opinion. But that's a nice design.<br />When you are curling your hair, keep the black piece on the curler facing your head, otherwise it will be a MESS. If you have super curly hair like I do, it will be PERFECT for taming down your curls, which is exactly how I use it.<br />Also, don't use this on your hair if its wet. Just wait until it's dry, I get an eye twitch when I see somebody or hear somebody straightening their hair when it's wet. It does nothing but kill your hair, causes split ends, and you can't come back from something like that. So, just wait until your hair is dry.<br />Make sure your hair also has ZERO tangles otherwise it WILL get stuck and THAT is no fun at all. Tiny strands will also be best, unless you like untangling your hair...<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided to review.", "images": [], "asin": "B01DVH07YM", "parent_asin": "B01DVH07YM", "user_id": "AHKCM6JME3JF3MNM5QSTAZEGHKVA", "timestamp": 1461973603000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

They all resemble each other, quality didn't appear to be<br />the same, as you can find many of these for sale, names vary.<br /><br />My (Brown) Hair Grip arrived today. I have tried it with two different Wigs.<br />1. Outre Dominican Blow Out Color #2  Half Wig with back and front combs and adjustable strap<br />2. FreeTress Equal Evyln lace front in Taffy. 2 side temple combs, back comb and adjustable strap<br /><br />1. Outre: I did not need to use the front comb at all. I did apply the back comb, it's not necessary though.<br />I did it out of habit. The Half Wig is in it's natural place, snug, it's moveable yes, it's not going anywhere,<br />The Grip actually makes the wig look more natural upon my head, it pulls it inward as natural hair looks.<br /><br />The Hair Grip wrap works as intended, no combs required to keep the wig in place, snug.<br /><br />2. FreeTress Evyln Color Taffy. I did not use either side temple combs.<br />The Hair Grip I chose is dark brown.<br /><br />Taffy Evyln is a dark root, darkest brown, blonde ombre,<br />if you really stare hard you can slightly see the grip/wrap in the part.<br />You would have to know it's there to detect it. I do not believe anyone would see it outright.<br /><br />Again same result, The Hair Grip works as intended. The wig fit is snug, no way is it coming off.<br />Whatever the magic is with this The Hair Grip, it does enhance the actual fit of your wig in the positive.<br /><br />I am glad I chose the Dark Brown Hair Grip vs the Beige, the Black, my natural hair is Darkest Brunette.<br />The brown color for me will be the most versatile for longevity of use and wear.<br /><br />The actual fabric is very light, it's nearly weightless, it is not a velvet material.<br />The Velcro is soft to touch. I do not foresee it damaging my wig interiors, nor the hair either.<br /><br />The Hair Grip is Firm &#34; in place&#34; there is not a feeling that I am wearing a headband..<br />No ring around the head feel.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Good work at an incredible price", "text": "I was pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied with this brush. First a note on the pics. I took the before pic on the left after hair had been washed, dried, brushed with a regular brush, with no product (oil, conditioner, balm, etc.) put into the beard. I then used the brush and took the pic before applying any product to style it. For something to straighten your beard quickly on days you don't wash it, this was very easy to use. It heats up fast (about a min) and within about 1-2 minutes, I was done.<br /><br />As you will notice, my beard is shorter on the sides and even my chin area isn't super long. I found the shorter bristles on this brush compared to bigger brushes meant for women's hair to work better for my beard. Also, I found it did a great job if you go slowly and comb UP from under the chin first. Then go back and brush it slowly down the other side. The extension cord is plenty long. The only downside of that is that it can make storage a challenge. I don't like wrapping the cord around the brush itself. So I had picked up some cheap velcro cord wraps from Amazon a few years ago and added one to the cord to make it easier to put away.<br /><br />I bought this to keep at the office. But for the price, I think I'll go back and pick up one more for the house and another to keep in my gym bag. I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to any guy with a short to medium beard.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dIxW7fA-L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dIxW7fA-L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dIxW7fA-L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Le3erYwRL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Le3erYwRL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Le3erYwRL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mNF5+hblL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mNF5+hblL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mNF5+hblL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sHsv-6gbL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sHsv-6gbL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sHsv-6gbL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07RLY4FTC", "parent_asin": "B07RLY4FTC", "user_id": "AGSKNLPIR7JGTZK6EKED2RURNSQQ", "timestamp": 1581432209311, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Brilliant Idea, Great Clips, Needs More Colors", "text": "These are wonderful little containers for travel. They are very easy to fill and dispense from, when you are ready to use your lotion or shampoo or facial cleanser, but they are also the right size to give you enough for a trip. The bottles come in different colors, so you can sort of color-code your products, however, they don't include enough colors. As a result, there are really only four bottles that can be used for travel, without labeling. Given that three are the white color, all of those will be for hand lotion. They are really convenient for attaching to a hook on a bag, which is great for me because my hands dry out so easily. Since I know what color the original bottles are, for my products, I love that they are different colors, but, again, they need more colors. My shampoo is blue. My body wash is white. My facial cleanser is green. My lotion is orange. The list goes on. I am giving these five stars because they work very well, have a nice thick top portion to hold that clip, so that they don't break off, and the clips themselves are nice medium-duty clips that really hold the little bottles in place. These are high quality for a great price and made with food-grade silicone, so they are non-toxic and won't leach any chemicals into my products, which means I won't be putting anything bad on my skin. Even though you might have to separate them out, unless you use products with color additives like pink-colored strawberry scented shampoo, and only use four for travel, while the other two are for different use, they are still really well made and easy to fill and dispense and attach and carry around. I highly recommend these. I look forward to seeing more colors and more multi-color sets. That's basically what we all need isn't it, for everything to come in different sets with more choices as to customizing the variations in the sets that we purchase. Some would want all pink.  Some would want all blue. Some would want a rainbow.

They dry quickly and do not budge, smear, crack, or disappear even with all-day wear or when sweating. I would say these liners are even better than Stila's liquid liner and Kat von D tattoo liner in lasting power, except Love Liner is not as hard to remove as those two.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice Brush | Similar To We Love Doodles & Chris Christensen | Cats Love It | Easily Removes Hair", "text": "If I didn't already own & love my \"We Love Doodles\" brand of big slicker brush, I would have rated this brush at a full 5 stars. Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc31For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc30I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc30Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />\ud83d\udc07Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />\ud83c\udf10 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />\ud83d\udc07I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br />\ud83c\udf10 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GU7NKWW<br /><br />Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands.

I was worried the teeth would be too far apart, they're not. What is surprising is that this even works on my short haired cats. It pulls out loose fur just fine & my cats enjoy the way it feels. It does pull my long haired cats fur. She doesn't put up a fuss. Just purrs, cries at me if it hurts & continues to purr & reaches for me when I stop.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is attractive & looks nice left out on my coffee table. The downside is that the handle is very thin & is pretty short. I have very small fine boned hands (I'm a wee Irish lass) & need to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have large hands, I'm not sure this will work. Also, because it's not ergonomic it's really only good for short periods of use esp. if you have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I like the comb even though the quality could be better. A wider, longer more comfortable handle made with a stronger wood would have been pawsome.

A little plastic in the lid, so not Zero Waste, but not bad. It is not scented. It does have a smell as is normal because the ingredients will have their own smell to them, but when applying I don't notice the smell, so calling it unscented or fragrance free is more than reasonable. I only notice its smell if I'm practically sticking my nose in the pot & inhaling deeply.<br /><br />For me, this isn't moisturizing enough for the dead of winter, but for spring & fall I expect it will serve me fine.<br /><br />Overall, I would have rated this higher if not for the ingredient concerns.", "images": [], "asin": "B07W1WJZFG", "parent_asin": "B07W1WJZFG", "user_id": "AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA", "timestamp": 1612028329379, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I am not being paid to leave a review, or representing anyone but myself here. This is the first time I tried PF's countouring powder, and I've used it for about three seasons. I like it. I don't love it.<br /><br />I have very pale skin with pink undertones that is uber-sensitive and I have to be very careful about sun exposure. Anything can make me break out in hives or eczema, at any time, even if I used it daily for years. Thankfully, PF products have never done that to me, in almost a decade.<br /><br />As for this product, the shades are where I take some issue. They worked best for my tone in summer, but now, in winter -- I'm shopping for a different product.<br /><br />* The dark shade is really mahogany-like, so I have to blend, blend, blend in daylight or risk looking like I smeared mud on my face. It's good for shading jawline and cheekbones with a light touch at temples if you need it. Beware, though. If you are very pale, you want a very light touch with this one.<br /><br />*The medium shade is very subtle and helps blend and soften the dark. It also works well as a matte bronzer, around sides of the nose, and wherever you need just a little definition. This is the best shade of the bunch, honestly. At least for my skin tone.<br /><br />* The light shade is, frankly, worthless to me. It gives my skin a pasty, chalky look and looks heavy. Yuck. I occasionally use it in tiny spots as a concealer, but as a contour powder, it just looks like I put on way too much setting powder or something. Instead, I use my lightest shade of matte eyeshadow (also a PF product) and a higher-end illuminator for highlighting. Those results are beautiful, frankly, even on my 38 year old skin.<br /><br />All in all, PF's contour colors are suitable for pale skin, but may be better on other slightly darker or warmer skin tones, or on summer tanned skin.", "images": [], "asin": "B01N9LC44Q", "parent_asin": "B09Q3X5YWR", "user_id": "AEWX7O6MFJHZBAJGD53YKT26N3XQ", "timestamp": 1543530726276, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "You can stop looking--THIS is \"The One\"!!!!", "text": "This Eyelash Curler is the BOMB!  I'm over 40 and have long eyelashes enhanced by several years of using Latisse.  The only issue is, while my lashes ARE long, they are \"Unruly\".  They stick out in multiple directions and if I don't use a curler, they look horrible.  Over three years ago I purchased a Shu Uemura online from their site.  I was happy with it and it performed well, but the pads wore out and when I went online to purchase another one, I was disappointed to see that not only were they purchased by L'Oreal, they were completely out of stock on eyelash curlers on their own website!  The internet is FLOODED with counterfeit Shu Uemuras and frankly I didn't want that either.  So I went in search of an alternative.<br /><br />I purchased another high rated curler, the Billy B Eyelash curler online hoping that it would do the trick.  The Billy B one is \"different\" from the Uemura--it has a more rounded shape and I was hoping it would do a fabulous job.  Unfortunately I found that I had a harder time getting the rounded Billy B up next to my eyelash base, and inevitably it would miss my corner lashes entirely.  I'm sure the Billy B works well for people with smaller, more rounded eyes, and in all honesty the pads on it were great.  It just wasn't the right fit for me.<br /><br />So again I went searching and that's when I stumbled across the Bella & Bear.  This thing is awesome and with a single coat of mascara for work, my eyelashes look a mile long and very well separated.  I can't say enough good things about how easy this was to put up against my eyeline and get a good curl.  The handle fits my hand well and the spring loaded mechanism on this means you don't have to press all that hard to achieve a good curl.  It's flatter and not as rounded as the Billy B, so if your eyes are longer and flatter, this one should be able to easy grab from corner to corner without missing any lashes.  In fact, when I lined up my curlers side by side, you can see the shape of this one is more like the Uemura than the Billy B.<br /><br />The curler arrives packaged in a box, so you won't have to worry about it being broken in shipment.<br /><br />In all, I'm so happy with this eyelash curler that I will never go back to another brand.  So long as this one never gets broken I should be in business for a very long time.  I've already recommended it to a friend to use on her daughter's long eyelashes during dance recitals.  My search for the perfect curler is over!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515oSJrWuPL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515oSJrWuPL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515oSJrWuPL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qnTEO6Y8L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qnTEO6Y8L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qnTEO6Y8L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B00JNI1DZQ", "parent_asin": "B00JNI1DZQ", "user_id": "AGGOR633N6ZQBUIKY6A5BY6LRPBQ", "timestamp": 1404998299000, "helpful_vote": 71, "verified_purchase": false}

Bullfrog discontinued it, and the replacement didn't come close in ease of use and effectiveness. I did a search, hoping to find a hidden BSF supply. None to be found, but I saw a reference to Doc Martin's Nextgen. Hmm.<br /><br />I decided to buy it. The product arrived. My first reaction was a little skeptical: 2 ounces isn't much!<br /><br />I gave it a try the next day on a hot, sunny day. A little bit goes a LONG way, so 2 ounces should last a while. It is very easy to apply, and even has a pleasant scent. I was out in the sun 5 hours with one application, and didn't have any burn. It didn't run until I got a surprise face bath, and then I had some run-off in my eyes. But I haven't had any eye run-off otherwise, even on long, hot, sweaty, muggy days.<br /><br />Doc Martin's Nextgen is a good substitute for the late Bullfrog Surfer Formula: it's easy to apply, it works for hours and hours, it stays put, but it's easy to remove when you want to remove it. I expect to be a repeat customer.<br /><br />A pleasant surprise was receiving a personal e-mail from the seller checking on my satisfaction.

I have also used the the cleanser made by this company and it really helps get rid of oiliness. I was super happy with that product so it seemed logic for me to jump all over this spot treatment product when I was provided the opportunity to purchase it at a discount in exchange for my honest review. So, I use the cleanser morning and night, pat dry and then apply this spot treatment to the breakout areas (usually my chin) and the fast acting treatment dries out the acne. I was able to tell a marked difference in how the acne dried out after the very first night. Also, it did not appear to dry out the skin around the breakout like some other harsher products have.

Over the years I\u2019ve experienced the good, the bad and the awful when purchasing skin care products.  I\u2019m happy to report that Jillaroo Luxury Natural Eye Cream by Y Not Natural is a GREAT product. It is a nourishing eye cream containing certified organic avocado oil, shea butter, vitamins, minerals and amino acids and retinol. I posted a photo with the full ingredient list.<br /><br />The Jillaroo Eye Cream spreads easily and quickly absorbs into the skin. I\u2019ve been applying the cream to my eyelids and below the eyes. It does not leave the eye area feeling or looking greasy. It has no detectable fragrance and it also does not sting my eyes. I let the Jillaroo Eye Cream absorb for about 2-3 minutes before applying any additional cosmetics to my eye area (mascara, eye line, etc.).  Only a very small amount of the Jillaroo Eye Cream is needed and I anticipate the bottle will at least two months or more.<br /><br />I\u2019ve been using the Jillaroo Eye Cream for 5 days, twice a day (morning & evening) to give the product a good test. I\u2019m really happy with the results. It definitely helps smooth away the fine lines around my eyes. I\u2019m seeing small improvements to my eye area. I\u2019m planning on repurchasing this product when the bottle starts getting low.<br /><br />The bottle is contains 15 grams of eye cream (about \u00bd an ounce). The 3.5 inch bottle is also a great size for traveling. The eye cream comes with a snap in place clear travel cap.<br /><br />Y-Not Natural is a Western Australian owned and operated family company. The Jillaroo Luxury, Natural Eye Cream is just one of many products they make. The company has a full line of high quality natural products. I\u2019m hoping more Y-Not Natural products become available on Amazon.<br /><br />On a final note - I receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I am not affiliated with the manufacturer or seller of the product. I do not receive any type of compensation for positive or negative reviews.

Unfortunately, I've yet to find one that can cater towards all of my skin's needs...this primer included.<br />As a primer, the product is honestly so-so. A primer, to me, needs to provide a great base for your makeup but also let your makeup be long lasting. This primer is great for sensitive, dry skin as a BASE. First off, it has the loveliest of scents and a very lightweight texture that seems to make your skin feel very fresh and bouncy. It smooths over dry patches and seems to fill it in to the point that your texture is nice and smooth.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "i wish i knew how to use ALL the brushes...", "text": "I was so excited to receive this set.  I already had a brush set from Mary Kay, that I love; but, I it only has 5 brushes.<br />Since I like to contour and highlight (subtly), I mostly needed brushes for this.<br />Researching sets produced a huge price range.  One could spend upwards of $70.00, with comparable brush sets.  Yikes!!  This set is much more affordable.  The brush handles are solid and bristles are firmly attached.  Some brushes are softer than others.<br /><br />So, if they are quality brushes and the price is reasonable, why am I only rating them 4 stars?  I had no clue what each brush was for, and the internet wasn't very helpful:(<br />If the brushes had been labeled, or there had been an insert explaining the function/functions of each brush--it would have received 5 stars.  Add pictures/diagrams for tips on use, even better.  I would be willing to pay a little extra for an easy to clean roll-up case for the brushes.  A girl needs to keep her brushes clean.  That is a feature, I believe many look for.  I travel a lot, so my roll up bag (for my other set) is essential.<br />As it is, Cosmopolitan magazine's website has an article on how to use different makeup brushes.  It was helpful for a few of the brushes, which I now use everyday.<br /><br />What I love:<br />*The sponges are fabulous for applying foundation and blending after you contour/highlight.<br />*The large, angled brush is great for applying blush, so it looks more natural.<br />*The large, pointed brush does a nice job, when adding bronzer to contour.<br />*The large, round brush is what I rely on for swirling on powder.<br />*The small, pointed brush is phenomenal at applying color at applying contour eye shadow.<br />* I use the small, tall bristled, rounded brush to blend the areas of shadow on my eyes that need softening.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />*Obviously, not knowing what each brush is for.<br />*The eyeshadow? brushes use too much product and application is sparse.  I believe it's because the bristles are stiffer than what I usually use.<br />*No case to keep them clean, which leads me to look for alternative solutions.  Leaving them out in the air, exposed, is a bad idea.  Think of the germs in the air, especially if you keep them on the bathroom sink.  Eww!  Bacteria grows quickly and can cause infections, such as pink eye.<br />User Tip: I use baby shampoo to wash my brushes.

Apply a base coat, a colored base color, AND a top coat before adding the chrome...this creates a wonderfully smooth and durable surface for the powder.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great, versatile builder\u2019s gel!", "text": "I was concerned this builder gel would be difficult to work with based only on how runny it looks in the product pix.  In real life it looks runny and sticky, but is surprisingly easy to work with.  After applying a long bead of the gel with the included brush, I pushed the gel to my desired shape, and then let it self level to smooth itself out.  On both thick and thin layers very little effort was required on my part.  In fact, if I tried to get the shape perfect with the brush, the gel got stickier and messier, so I quickly learned to let the gel smooth itself out.  Tip: once you get your shape all smoothed out, turn your nail upside down and let gravity create a natural apex before popping it under the lamp. So far I\u2019ve only used the clear gel.  I created on extension (not shown), attached rhinestones to several pride nails, and fully encapsulated a fully covered rhinestone nail.  1 thick layer of this hard gel and a have encased rhinestones that fully cured in just over 2 minutes!  I also plan to use this for simple overlays when my nail need additional support.  The sticker nail forms work well, the slip solution is good for clean up work (not shaping the gel), and the brush/spatula tool work as expected.

The eye patches are gel patches and not meant to be wet with serum - the serum is released by the gel when it's in contact with skin.  The patches easily stayed in place, but resulted in no visible improvements, and left my undereye area feeling a little dehydrated.  The lip patch is also a gel patch.  It was odd to wear, but it stayed on while I moved around and almost seemed to form a suction seal around my mouth after 10 minutes.  I liked this patch - it left my lips smooth and soft for a day and a half...nice!  The foot booties are for moisturizing only...these are NOT exfoliating booties that take days to work and lead to skin peeling.  They were easy to use and comfortable to wear.  I wore them for 30 minutes and was quite pleased with how soft my feet still felt after 2 days.  My only issue was that after removing the booties I had to spend a good amount of time massaging in the lotion left on my feet...seriously, even after trying to dry them with a towel my feet felt greasy.  Be sure to allow time for the product to absorb afterwards and don't plan to run out the door like I did.  For all of this, I would give the set 4 stars.  However, there's an EXCESSIVE amount of packaging.  The patches all have plastic protectors on both sides, are enclosed in plastic clam shells, and are sealed in the final package.

The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn\u2019t fully dry or pull my skin, and it\u2019s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don\u2019t care for.  They\u2019re aren\u2019t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn\u2019t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can\u2019t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn\u2019t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.

The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They\u2019re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they\u2019re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there\u2019s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it\u2019s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I\u2019ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.

Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I\u2019m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don\u2019t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what\u2019s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it\u2019s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn\u2019t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it\u2019s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I\u2019m constantly concerned it\u2019s going to stain my floor grout.

Conveniently, it didn\u2019t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming.  TIP:  I\u2019ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn\u2019t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Comparable to the basic Waterpik portable with a few improvements and extras", "text": "This unit is comparable to my very basic travel Waterpik flosser. In fact it has several features that the basic model lacks for around the same price. This unit has three speeds, whereas the entry level Waterpik only has one. The fastest speed is comparable with the one speed on my Waterpik, and it\u2019s the only speed I need. This unit has a charge light (blinks until charged) while there is no such light on the comparably priced Waterpik. This device has about the same sized reservoir as the Waterpik, but because of the design, it\u2019s on the bottom as opposed to along the sides of the unit, the result being that it makes it a lot bulkier, which is unfortunate in a travel water flosser. Unfortunately, there is no advantage to this design as like the Waterpik, it begins to stop pumping water as the tank gets lower, forcing the user to keep the unit vertical in order to get to the water at the very bottom of the reservoir, which can become quite awkward while trying to get around the teeth and gums. I\u2019ve owned several of these, and to be fair, they all suffer from this same problem.<br /><br />One more thing: this unit comes with a nice case and a stash of attachments (which are usually found in home units and don\u2019t generally come with portable units ,) none of which I have much use for, but I guess it\u2019s good to know they\u2019re there. It does include two of the standard water flosser adaptors, so two people can use it.<br /><br />The only thing that remains to be seen is how long this puppy will last. This is my 3rd travel water flosser.

I LOVE the colors and that it's padded.  The s-shaped design of the bristles are a new thing for me but it does seem to help with detangling - it doesn't pull to hard, very gentle.  The padding is not excessive but really helps with snarled hair.  I think this works BETTER than some of the detangle wet brushes you see in stores.<br /><br />The handle is a nice silicone grip, the bristles feel light weight but solid - not breakable.  Another plus - when brushing my daughters hair (she's 5) if I accidently snag her ear, she said it doesn't hurt as bad as the other brushes we've used before!  I don't brush hard but some of the other brushes I've used before have been so rough on her ear that she has cried.  :(  This one does not!  No more crying!!!

I couldn\u2019t believe it and thought my immune system was compromised. (I haven\u2019t had one since 5 years old, now 50)<br />I iced it when feeling the onset, took 4,000 mg of Lysine, put DSMO rose on it( never read anything about it concerning this but figured why not, I have it, no side effects besides tasting garlic in your mouth briefly)  popped zicam (zinc) tablets every hour, and did a dab of Abreva. The next day the fever blister disappeared almost. Half the size. I told my sister who couldn\u2019t believe it either as she gets them 2x a year.<br />I would say to use this product (the rose cream first) if you are unfamiliar with DSMO before you graduate to liquid. Now that I know it can be used for anything besides pain, I\u2019m all in.<br />I will say for pain, when used with other things in combination/conjunction  (Joint care by Redd. Remedies), MSM course organic flakes and DSMO, you don\u2019t have to reach for prescription meds. You can find all on amazon.  I have all prescription meds under the sun for my condition. Pain meds, muscle relaxers, lidocaine patches..But I am firm believer prescription meds lead to other problems or diseases. Try natural first.  My concoction of the 3 natural works wonders.
