The only way I could get any sort of volume was to go the salon and get a blow out which, for obvious financial reasons, I can't do every day. I had a list of requitements for a round brush and this set checks every box!<br />They are sturdy and won't fall apart like the cheap ones you get at the big box stores. The hollow barrel is ceramic coated for better heat conduction without the extra damage to your hair you get from a metal barrel. The bristles are plastic but flexible and keep your hair smooth amd shiney. As a fun bonus, I adore the color! The set of 3 give you 1-1/4&#34;, 1-3/4&#34; and 2&#34; sizes. It also comes in an aesthetically pleasing box that is perfect for wrapping if this is intended as a gift.<br />If you don't know how to use a round brush I suggest looking up some tips. I was making it much harder than it needed to be! Biggest tip, don't try to do a blowout on wet hair! Your hair should be damp at best, like 80% dry.

I loved the vanilla scent.<br />I like that each bath bomb contains essential oils to enhance its purpose.<br />Now, here's when my snobiness comes through. Hope te bath bombs smelled great, once you drop it into the water the smell is short lived at best. Also the fizz is a bit disappointing. With my other (more expensive) bath bombs, they fizz like crazy.<br />All in all, these are great but just don't expect the high dollar bath bomb experience.", "output": "Nice set for gifting, lack a bit compared to name brand bath bombs"}

This is especially convenient when I have to go elsewhere to give a massage and I don't have any means to heat my oil.<br />I'm glad that I have this fractionated coconut oil, it has made life a bit easier, especially when I am in a hurry. I do still use my regular coconut oil now and again, but for convenience sake I find myself using this product more and more often.<br /> I hope my review was somewhat helpful for you!", "output": "Easy to Use"}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "Oh how I love lavender!  I have been using this for over a month now and am loving it!  I put it in my diffuser and my house always smells amazing!  It is great for putting some drops in the bathtub and having yourself a good long relaxing soak.  A new use I have found for it, is I put some in the hot tub! I don't use a lot as I don't want to clog any pipes or have it build up anywhere, but I have researched it and a little bit is just fine to use.  Talk about relaxing!  Sitting in the hot tub under the starry night with the jets on and all the steam rising off the water smells of lavender.  Put a glass of wine in my hand and that's what I call a perfect night!<br /> I cannot testify that it makes me sleep better because I have an infant son that is doing his best to keep me from sleeping.  But it is a very relaxing essential oil to use.  Helps calm me down when I am super stressed out.  Plus, even though I use every day, I feel this bottle will last me quite a long time because a little bit goes a long ways!  I would definitely recommend this oil to anyone who loves lavender.<br /> I hope my review was helpful for you!", "output": "For the love of lavender"}

But, if I were to buy again, I would probably go with the lower-cost 7xxx series.  There are a few more features on the 8140XL -- the charging stand and full charge LED -- but basically Norelco makes a decent electric shaver.  Upsides:<br />1) One significant benefit is the LONG time before the battery needs to be recharged -- perhaps a combination of using a good battery and low power requirements. I have taken it on a week-long business trip without bringing the charger.<br />Downsides:<br />1) $45 for a set of replacement blades is high. However, after a year, the original blade set is still adequate.<br />2) A \"needs charging\" LED would be useful.<br />Note that my shaver gets relatively light usage -- my beard is not overly thick, and I use a Gillette blade after not shaving over the weekend -- a blade gives a much quicker and better shave on a couple days' growth.

Other sellers through Amazon may be more honest in their descriptions of these Salux cloths. I won't know, I guess, until I receive the ones I ordered through Amazon from a different merchant.

I’ve had to stop wearing cosmetics, and my skin routine has felt like a part time job. I also have several allergies, and the antihistamines I have to take make my skin/lips even more dry. I’ve apparently become overly sensitized to ingredients in 95%+ of commercial lip balm products, “natural” ingredients/products. No matter how much water I drink, very healthy diet, hyaluronic acid supplements & topical hyaluronic acid + occlusives, running a humidifier, staying indoors, etc., nothing has helped the severe, painful peeling of my lips for the past 3-4 years. It’s been embarrassing and has made talking, eating and drinking an uncomfortable and painful.<br /><br />Everything I tried seemed to make this even worse, so I eventually gave up on lip balm. I tried “nothing,” (just to see if I actually needed lip balm- that was a mistake!). I resorted to trying single ingredient options, just to help identify what the problem ingredient might be: testing by applying only straight argan, olive, safflower or squalane oils (messy, shiny, and doesn’t last without an occlusive layer added on top), straight manuka honey (messy, sticky, expensive and only made me want to lick my lips all day lol). Made my own manuka honey, argan oil and beeswax product (worked pretty well but oh so messy, time consuming to make).<br /><br />Finally gave up on that and was only able to use Vanicream ointment (dermatologist recommended and similar to Vaseline but without the petrochemical odor- I can’t use products like Vaseline or Aquaphor FWIW). But even that wasn’t working well because i needed to be SO careful not to apply too much, or the ointment would eventually  migrate onto my face (usually while sleeping), which would cause rosacea flares (heavy occlusives seal in moisture but can also trap in just enough heat to cause a rosacea flare).<br /><br />But that messy solution that only stopped **some** of the peeling temporarily, and never resolved the issue entirely. Even applying every hour on the hour didn’t make much of a difference. My lips were still chapped feeling/peeling every day, just slightly less chapped.<br /><br />But THIS STUFF IS WHAT ALL LIP BALMS ARE MEANT TO BE! I am not exaggerating when I say that within an hour or so after applying this for the first time, I noticed my lips didn’t feel rough any longer… for the first time in YEARS!!! Weird, right?!! I didn’t believe it could be possible at first, but it’s truly  like I’ve never had chapped, peeling lips. Miracle in a tube!<br /><br />This must be what Goldilocks looks for when her lips are chapped: It doesn’t burn. It doesn’t sting. It doesn’t taste weird. It’s not too shiny or greasy feeling. It just makes my lips feel smooth and soft. You can faintly taste the elderberry/manuka honey when applying but it doesn’t linger. It’s not overpowering or flavorful enough to make you inadvertently lick your lips, which I always seem to do with “yummy” lip balm products.<br /><br />It just works. My grad school student son also loves it for the same reasons. It just makes your lips feel and look like lips are supposed to feel and look like. It’s long lasting, and when it does eventually lwear off, you won’t get that “rebound dryness” you might get from products like Eos, Chap-Stick and Burt’s Bees. It’s just SO perfect!!!", "output": "Miracle in a tube! This works when nothing else will! Amazing!!!"}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I’ve been using Savannah Bee Co. Tupelo Honey lip balm for a while and it’s the BEST I’ve ever used! But it’s hard for me to find locally, so this was a score! My lips have always gotten severely chapped no matter how much water I drink, no matter what I do. I take medications that make my mouth and skin feel dry, so fighting chapped lips is  a never-ending battle. I’m never without at least one tube of lip balm within arm’s reach!<br />I’ve used almost every non-petroleum based “premium” lip balm out there, and I’ve tried coconut oil, Shea butter, lanolin, you name it. I’ve been settling for Burt’s Bees and Dr. Bronners, both of which feel pretty good but don’t seem to last very long.<br />This is the first lip balm I’ve tried in 40+ years that seems to actually work! It goes on much more smoothly, tastes *really* good but isn’t overpowering at all, and actually helps keep my lips soft! Finally!!!<br />For anyone wondering, the key lime flavor is really good! I’d never tried it before, but since I love key lime pie, I took a chance. It really does taste like key lime! Not overpowering or artificial tasting and seems to work just as well as the Tupelo honey flavor.<br />The seller shipped this quickly, and with a nice personal touch. Thank you so much! I’ll be back soon!", "output": "Yum!!! Key lime is so good! Best lip balm ever!"}

I also get really chapped lips in the winter from the dry air, so I basically use lip balm year round.  The lip balm goes on silky smooth and smells amazing.  I don't know if it is flavored because I avoid licking my lips, because that just chaps them more and makes the situation worse. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a pain to get the stick to move up when you twist the bottom.

The patchouli scent is there, but it doesn't smell like a busload of hippies just past by. The charcoal seems to help keep the scent in check. So what you end up with is a nice musky, woodsy smell that isn't overpowering.<br /><br />When opening the package, a little moisture control packet was included with it... you know, those little &#34;do not eat&#34; things. Also, this is a large bar of soap! This was a really fresh piece of soap as it was practically starting to melt in my hand. I actually let this sit out on a metal rack for about 3 weeks to cure. Again, this is a huge piece of soap so after that drying period, I cut it in half for use. The charcoal has little scrubby bits in it, but they don't hurt my sensitive skin. Also, the soap itself is rather mild so it doesn't make my skin break out either. This melts slowly, so you do get a lot of bang for your buck. It cleans your skin nicely and also leaves you feeling moisturized. After showering, the smell gets a little bit sweeter, definitely not candy sweet, but a little lighter, softer and stays on you for a while afterwards.<br /><br />This is a great piece of soap if you like outdoor, woodsy, earthy kinda scents. If you're looking for candy sweet or citrus, you will be severely disappointed.<br /><br />FYI: When I bought this a few months ago, the name of this product was &#34;Patchouli Charcoal&#34; but this is the link along with this product so I believe that they just changed the name of the product :) Also, I didn't get ANY type of deal on this for my review...

I noticed that some reviewers were not pleased with the glimmersticks gooey consistency.  What I do to reduce the pliability so I can dry etch the color onto my eyebrow is I allow the stick to dry out a bit by removing the cap for a day.  This way it is not quite so sticky and gooey, and more like a crayon consistency that etches very nicely onto my brow without leaving tiny particles or gooey globs.  They also hold up longer this way and the tip remains sharp as well instead of rounding out.  Otherwise if the stick is right out of the wrapper I have to be extremely cautious about applying too much or making it look 'clownish' and less natural.  These sticks can also be used as eye liners if they are not allowed to dry out a bit because they are so pliable.  But I do adore this perfect color for my blonde hair and accents, so I simply dry them for a day, then use them like an eyebrow pencil that doesn't glob or goo on, and I'm a happy camper!  It is hard to find this color in other brands and styles, so I will stick with Avon.", "output": "Love this color!!!"}

If the wave doesn't have product, it isn't tame. So, most mornings I dry/straighten it to avoid looking like a wild banshee at work.<br />However, I recently moved to Florida and because of the humidity, my waves are being a bit more cooperative. That being said, a product like this that would help hold the wave throughout the day and tame the &#34;wildness&#34; is desirable. Unfortunately, this has not worked for me as it is advertised.<br />There isn't enough salt to hold the hair in place. Instead of a subtle stiffness to hold the 'beach wave', my hair appeared a droopy, greasy mess that looks like I'd slept in a frying pan (with leftover bacon grease) rather than the just-off-the-surf look that I was anticipating.<br />Everyone's hair is different, so perhaps this product works better for others. My hair is long and thick. I would think that this may work better for people with shorter hair where gravity isn't fighting with the product all day.<br />Okay, so why did I give this more than one star? IT SMELLS AMAZING!

Second, you don't have to press hard to get it to work -- just keep passing it over any area of your skin requiring extra attention and it will do the job.  Third, the lotion/gel samples make the shave live up to its name of Cool Skin -- no razor burn whatsoever.<br /><br />I have two issues with the shaver.  First, Norelco still has one of the most inconvenient methods of cleaning I've ever seen.  Every few days you need to disassemble the blades from the discs holding them and using a brush (I use an old toothbrush) to get the old hair out of there.  Rinsing it under water doesn't do anything but remove the stray hair stubble in the head itself.<br /><br />Second, the refills are difficult to find.  They are relatively expensive in most sources (including here at Amazon) but are available at the world's largest retailer in a box of 5 for $4.94.  I find they last about 10 days if you don't go crazy pressing the button for lotion.  I also find the lotion much better than the gel.  When I shave at home, I just use regular shave gel with it to preserve the expensive cartridge-based lubricants.", "output": "Excellent product!"}

These are not comfortable to sleep in.  Also sleeping in them does not affect the outcome of the curls.  They are very springy.  I have a little over shoulder length hair, and these are way too long.  My hair doesn't fill half of the length of the curler.  Do not use large amounts of hair in each, or you will not get defined curls.  Smaller portions work really well for defined curls. This is time consuming, so get ready to spend some time doing this.

I listed to the review by Renee that suggested cutting this soap bar into much smaller pieces. I probably have 80 pieces all together now, that way your not having to wet the entire soap bar, and you cut down on the waste. I placed them in a sandwich bag (that barely closes).

I took great lengths with this review since I had such a difficult time finding what I needed. Hope to spare someone else the grief. They are not micro which was too small, true to size 1cm wide and approximately 1.5 cm long.<br /> So far they are holding well (I have long thick hair with bangs). I had one left from a set bought probably 20 years ago which were obviously good quality. They are nearly identical except these do allow for a better grip for your fingers which has to be a feat for such a small clip. Plus I have arthritis in my thumbs, it makes a difference.  These are of a different plastic maybe less durable but it's not that thin brittle type plastic. I'm adding pictures to compare. My original is on the left side. So yes I'm pleased with how these clips are designed and if they hold up for longer than 9 months that would be nice.", "output": "As close as I have found to my original from the 1990's"}

Tarte has done away with the 'Shape Tape Foundation' and has replaced it with..... \"Face Tape Foundation.\"<br /><br />I tried the \"Face Tape Foundation\" which is somehow a blend of the 'matte' and the 'hydrating' Shape Tape Foundation formulas.  It didn't do well for me.  It did not seem to cover as well, and it didn't give my skin that airbrushed glow and look.  It was ok, but wasn't superior to other foundations on the market like the Shape Tape Hydrating Foundation was.<br /><br />I am a Baby Boomer and have dry skin that has lines and some wrinkles. The Hydrating Foundation really made my complexion look very good. It has become more and more difficult to find my shade in the Hydrating Formula which is 29B.  Now that I can no longer find it, I decided to try the Shape Tape Matte Formula in shade 29B.<br /><br />I see from other reviews that the Matte Formula can be very drying, settling into pores, wrinkles and lines.  When I wore it, it felt like it literally sucked the moisture right out if my facial skin, leaving it almost painfully dry!!!<br /><br />I have discovered a way to sidestep that and make this look and feel just as nice as the Hydrating Formula.  Under my moisturizer, I apply a thin layer of Argan Oil. Then after a couple of minutes I apply my moisturizer. Then I apply \"Tarte Base Tape PRIMER.\"  This primer is amazing and seriously the best I've ever used.  It is amazing how it makes the Matte Formula look and feel as nice as the Hydrating Formula. It leaves your skin feeling so supple and moist, but not oily.<br /><br />I'm thrilled I can still find the Tarte Shape Tape Foundation in my shade, even in the Matte Formula.  With the benefit of argan oil and the superior Tarte Base Tape Primer, the problem has been resolved.<br /><br />I will buy a few more bottles of the Shape Tape Foundation, Matte Formula while I can.  It's the absolute BEST foundation I've ever used.<br />Thank you Tarte!!

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I noticed some other reviews talking about the brush being dirty when they received it.  Mine didn't seem to be although I did shampoo it once before I used it.  I have a couple other brushes in this price range.  The brush head seems to be the same size and consistency of my other two brushes.  The handle is a little shorter than one (same length as the other) and narrower/thinner than the handle on both my other brushes.  Not horrible but just a little smaller than I was used to.  The first couple times I used the brush it did shed maybe 5-6 bristles each time. But that number dropped off drastically and after a couple weeks of use it might loose a bristle every second or third use.<br />One thing I was happy about was that the complete brush not seems well seated/anchored in the handle.  Every other brush i have bought the whole brush head loosened almost immediately and within a couple weeks came out. So i'd have to break out the Gorilla Glue and repair.  But this brush seems solid.<br />The brush works up a decent lather although it is not as easy or as voluminous a lather as my favorite brush and i'm not sure why.  The brushes seem very similar.  My best guess is the Beau Brummell doesn't seem to retain moisture as well as my other brush.<br />All in all it is a good brush and a great brush for the price.<br />Please note that I received this brush at about an 85% discount with the stipulation that I write a review.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 19, 2015:  So its now been about two months of using this brush about 3-5 times per week.  And lately it has been shedding like crazy.  Every time I use it I end up with 5-10 loose brush hairs stuck in my shave cream jar or on my face.  At this rate it will need rogaine soon.

There’s a deep purple that is almost red and a purple that’s in the middle of the light and dark. The tiara is substantial. It’s not sharp despite looking like it has many sharp pieces to it. I will say a few of the rhinestones that set up on top of the metal decoration were bent. I was able to bend them back ever so slightly. Of course I worry too much bending may break the tiara.<br /><br />It fits well on the head and it is quite comfortable.

I would say quality falls into the average lane.  Some of them have more glue visible than others but overall they’ve been done well enough. The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair.

The nail polishes are very Arendelle<br />colors. Blue, purple, green, yellow, and orange are the main color themes in the set. They are natural and remind us of the elements; trees, water, ice, etc. There is a nail dryer that is in the shade of purple with an Elsa and Ana sticker on the front. It’s a petite size and perfect for little princess hands. I like that the battery case is enclosed with two tiny screws. They are safe and the children are unable to get to them. After the nails have been dried there are various gemstones and stickers that can be used. They are a small size and work for toddler and up. The gemstones are a little bit bigger and a little large on my toddler‘s fingers.  However the size is ideal for a child’s finger nails.<br /><br />My daughter has had so much fun with this kit. There are a ton of options for color. Naturally with so much to choose from, she never wants any one fingernail painted the same.<br /><br />The bottles have all been easy to open and use. They each have a different color as well as a different sticker for the handle of the nail polish.

A brush with handle seemed like the obvious choice.<br /><br />The first one I bought had bristles on it and it was so hard it hurt to use so I couldn’t even bear the discomfort on my back. That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It’s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it’s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It’s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn’t any exfoliating action. I wouldn’t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It’s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth.

It has a sticky feel coming out of the bottle (mine came with a dropper rather than a pump), and it feels a bit odd going on -- sort of like rubbing mayonnaise into your skin. But then it absorbs well and leaves my skin a bit tighter and smoother. One reviewer has perfectly described the effect as akin to putting on pantyhose -- everything just feels held together nicely.<br /><br />I can't honestly say I will re-order this, because I use a pore refiner that does a better job of leaving my face makeup-ready, and Vitamin C serum seems to leave my skin clearer and nicer. But this works well enough that I finished the bottle.<br /><br />For those who want to use bamboo serum, this one is probably worth a try.

The FDA neither reviews nor approves cosmetics products, and the cGMP seal assures that basic manufacturing practices have been met. Also,a cGMP label means that the facility is registered with the FDA.<br /><br />I like this product, and I can highly recommend it.", "output": "A good product at a good price."}

I'm happy that this product works for all the 5- and 4-star reviewers. For me...meh.<br /><br />For starters, this feels greasy on my skin and takes longer than other moisturizers to absorb. Certainly, it is an &#34;okay&#34; moisturizer, hence the three stars. (&#34;It's okay.&#34;) But for me, it's sure nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I very much like the flip-top tube -- very quick and easy to open and dispense with one hand. The texture is nice. And I do appreciate the absence of scent. But an hour after I've applied it, my face feels no different than itI did before I put it on.<br /><br />Having said that, I will say that I have researched the use and effects of ceramide on skin, and it does seem that, in certain strengths and when used with certain other ingredients, ceremides can help skin retain moisture. So, this product will work for some people. It just doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />This product is not overly expensive, which helps, but there are a number of lower-priced moisturizers that I believe most people would find just as good as (or perhaps better than) this one. I can't recommend it as a great moisturizer, and I honestly don't know how it gets such terrific views, but that's the nature of skin care: what works for some doesn't work for others. I just can't see this one as being any kind of a magic bullet.", "output": "It's okay."}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": ".<br />I ordered this makeup primer because I had been using Eclipse Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple of months and loved what it was doing for my face -- leaving it much brighter -- and I hoped that the foundation primer would work as well as the serum. And it does!<br /><br />I have used at least a half-dozen foundation primers over the years. I find that they not only help with foundation application, they also help foundation look better and last longer. For a couple of years now, I've used Avon's Magix Face Perfector, which is a reasonably priced, fine product. Having now used Eclipse Foundation Primer, though, I have a new favorite.<br /><br />For starters, this product goes on and absorbs into the skin with amazing ease. It comes out of the container in a semi-solid state and then just melts as I rub it into the skin. After letting it sink in for a minute (it doesn't take long), I'm ready to apply foundation, which then goes on smoothly and evenly. Applied over this primer, my foundation is more consistently even, which looks very nice. And with the foundation being smoother on the face, my blusher and powder apply more smoothly and evenly, too.<br /><br />Another thing I like about the Eclipse primer is the way it helps me go without foundation altogether! It makes my skin feel and appear so silky, I can just apply a bit of blusher and I'm ready to go. Since I'm 63, that's saying something!<br /><br />The Amazon product description refers to the primer as a &#34;powdery gel&#34; -- and that's a perfect description. It feels really good on my skin and makes my skin look better regardless of whether I follow it with foundation, just powder or blusher, or nothing else at all.<br /><br />The price of this foundation primer seems a bit high until it becomes apparent how long it lasts. It doesn't take much to cover the face; a little goes a long way. Plus, if you go to the Global Care Essentials website, you'll see that it's substantially higher there than on Amazon!<br /><br />My experience with this product has been thoroughly delightful, and I'm very glad to have found it. I can recommend it highly.", "output": "This is one fine product!"}

You have to carefully massage it onto your skin, making sure little chunks don't fall on the ground. But it definitely works to soften, protect and heal extremely dry, irritated, and even cracked skin. And a little does go a long way. The container is glass and just small enough to fit in my coat pocket, which makes it convenient to carry around.<br /><br />I have serious eczema, and Gold Clover and Burt's Bees Hand Salve are the only natural products that are thick enough to provide relief. The difference between this and Burt's Bees is that Gold Clover is less greasy and seems to absorb quicker. But Burt's Bees smells better to me. Although this Gold Clover does have a light mint/lavender scent, overall the product smells milky. It doesn't bother me too much and thankfully the smell does go away. However, the smell reminds me baby milk spit up. Also, sometimes the thought of rubbing dead animal fat on my skin gets a little weird. But I use this several times a day, especially after hand washing, and my skin is looking better than ever.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product that provides relief for eczema and healing for extremely dry skin. It's a great alternative to chemically-laden but well-publicized products like O'Kieff's for Working Hands. If you order in bulk, it's more economical to do it through their website. But for just one, it's cheaper to order on Amazon. And I will definitely be ordering more!", "output": "Amazing product for extremely dry skin"}

Within the first week of using this soap I noticed old acne marks fading. They're not completely gone, still I've noticed a improvement.  I've been using it for about a month and any acne I had is controlled. I didn't have a major problem with acne. Just now and then a couple would come up and and leave dark spots. The dark spots were more of a problem to me. I have olive complexion, oily skin, and I'm in my 30's. In my teens I didn't have problems with acne. So it became frustrating to have them in my 30's. I  also used it on a dark spot on my foot that I got from a bug bite months ago. The bug bite swelling went away but the dark spot remained. After using this Dead Sea soap it started to fade too. One thing I didn't expect was that the soap doesn't lather very much. It doesn't lather in the way I'm use to with other soaps. I've reordered it and I'm happy with it.", "output": "It works"}

I use it like a body spray, and I get 2-3 decent hours out of it with 6-8 sprays.<br /><br />If you love a clean jasmine and do not mind the poor performance, then I definitely recommend this fragrance to you.  You can find other jasmine fragrances with better performance, but you will pay a lot more.  For the price point, this is a nice fragrance.  I think it leans feminine, but the right man could pull it off.  Good day or night and any venue.  Good for just about any age, too.  This is a soft, light, green jasmine soliflore.

It's getting harder and harder to resist the call of the dreaded razor.<br /><br />I purchased this product several months ago and have used the epilator and callus sander attachments. The sander works the same as any other battery powered shaver.  The epilator is a life changer though. The first time you use it is a bit rough if you haven't used one before, or get waxed. But I haven't had to pick up a razor since I started using this. Each time is easier, and the hairs grow back soft rather than the nasty stubble you get from shaving. Also, I've noticed less and less hair growing back. I could probably pluck the individual hairs on my legs if I had to.<br />Be warned though that the ingrown hair issue is real.  If you do not exfoliate you will regret it.  As to the battery life issue, when I first started using this I would be able to only do one whole leg before the battery started winding down. I could maybe get through both armpits and forearms on a single charge. But now there's so little hair that I can do everything on one charge (both legs from foot to groin, armpits and forearms).<br />With all this said, the device stopped working today. It will charge, and the light turns on, but it won't spin.  I have a feeling I'm going to need a new battery.  Will update when I know more.", "output": "Life changer"}

Comb your hair back to the nape of neck and hold it like you're making a ponytail and twist it and then fold it up against the back of your head and apply the leather piece and fasten with stick.

Also so that my cold wet hair wouldn't be all over the place lol well there's been no color bleeding and my hair has little to no frizz when I wake up now! Being able to leave my hair down while still somewhat wet, my hair dries naturally and my curls aren't looking like I just got my socks rocked off 🤣><br /><br />I don't think my first review was approved because I was quite upset when I wrote it. Well I finally got them! I had ordered these along with a couple other items. My tracking for this said it was delivered in the same box as something else I had ordered. Well they weren't in there! Amazon was pretty quick to replace the things I did not receive and I appreciate that!<br /><br />So I did just receive these today and I'm wearing it now after my hair had dried just a lil bit after my shower. It seems to be holding up. The band is a bit big though so I have to put it up behind my ears so it doesn't fall down and cover my whole face. I do have quite a bit of hair. Thick and wavy so I love how much room there is for my hair. I'm glad it's not cutting off circulation on my head but I am a bit worried it might fall off while sleeping since they are a bit loose. First time ever wearing a bonnet so I can't really compare it to others but they seem like ok quality. They're soft and hoping it helps me to wake up with less frizzy hair!

My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!<br /><br />Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:<br /><br />Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles<br />Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes<br />Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.<br />Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.<br /><br />Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call &#34;teary eyes&#34;. I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.", "output": "Valentia : True Glow Eye Cream Review"}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.<br /><br />Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!<br /><br />I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!<br /><br />Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.<br /><br />Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonal allergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Oz Naturals.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "InstaNatural: Cellulite Cream<br /><br />This product is part of their Body Creams collection and helps with everything from the cellulite to the dimples a person may suffer from. You get a boost from:<br /><br />Caffeine- Derived from green tea, which provides you with instant firming and lifting results<br />Retinol- allows the skin to resurface at a quicker pace, lessening the appearance of the cellulite/dimples<br />Cocoa Butter- softens and also helps keep the skin looking beautiful<br />Shea Butter- allows the “newer” skin to get a healthy amount of nutrients and moisture<br />Vitamin C- helps your skin hold more moisture and gives it a healthy glow (brightens)<br />Vitamin B5- helps to keep skin soft and healthy, but also provides a smoother look<br />All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested<br /><br />Application- The product works best when applied twice a day, just like a facial skincare regimen. You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.<br /><br />What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I’m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural’s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the “turn-over” process of shedding our “damaged” looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin’s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.

The makeup of this serum is truly impressive. It's also unusual to find one with Vitamin C and Retinol together in the same serum. This was my first time using this product and I was trying a new moisturizer as well so I did a controlled study. I washed my face and applied the serum alone. My face turned very red and hot like a bad sunburn. I washed it off, applied straight aloe Vera gel to calm my skin and left it on overnight. By the next morning all was well so I cleansed my skin as usual and applied the new moisturizer (which was also by Elrique Naturals) and the same thing happened. Needless to say both products were extremely uncomfortable to use. Comparing the ingredients I don't see anything listed on either product that would cause this. I first suspected Niacinimide (Vitamin B3), but it's not listed. It's possible that the Vitamin C was too strong for my skin but there is none in the moisturizer. I have no issues with Retinol so that's not it. The reasons why Elrique Naturals did not agree with my skin will have to remain a mystery.", "output": "A Unique, All-In-One Serum"}

For the price, and it's a good price for the style of the cream and the fragrance, this is an amazing lotion. It's creamy, thick and rich and the fragrance is strong but not overpowering. This has a subtle burnt brown sugar scent with a strong vanilla overtone. It's just ever so slightly greasy right at first, but it absorbs very quickly and is just soft and luxurious. It takes very little to spread over a larger surface, so it lasts for a long time too. This larger, 8-ounce bottle, is too big for carrying in a purse, but for overnight bags, beach bags, etc., it's great, and perfect for at home. Get the hand lotion in the 4-ounce bottle if you want it in a small enough size for a purse.<br /><br />I love smelly stuff--lotions, perfumes, body washes, candles, etc. Bodycology is really as good as some of the pricier brands but at a much more reasonable price. If you like other brown sugar vanilla products, or burnt warm sugar products, or warm vanilla scented products, then you'll probably like this scent too, and the lotion is just creamy and nice.", "output": "Oh, yummmm!

I put the Mascream on my face, and it stung a teeny tiny bit, but nothing like most scented lotions. I massaged it into my skin, and it feels really soft.

I use this hair mask 3 to 4 times a week because of the degree of damage my hair has and it has worked beautifully. It doesn’t leave my hair looking oily, It is creamy and not an oil, because I personally don’t really like putting oil in my hair. It is fine and as much as it is damage it won’t take long for the roots to look greasy when I have oil in my hair. I’m really happy I discovered this hair mask. I will be reordering!", "output": "Has really helped my damaged hair"}

It even tells you when it needs cleaning, charging and time used for each shave.<br /><br />At first, I thought I would never use the cleaning system, but since I had it I would at least try it. The cleaning system works very good and conditions the razor. It also recharges the razor if you leave the system on, with the lever down. Now I have been using the cleaning system every couple of days, because I like the way it conditions the blades.<br /><br />I have used several Norelco electric razors for the last 30 years and have always been satisfied with the razors. However, the Norelco 9170XL is so much more superior it's hard to compare. This electric razor gives me a much closer shave, cleaner, faster shave then any of my older electric razors.

In addition to being a lot less expensive it has a much simplified design which should last longer, and has a user replaceable battery.<br /><br />On the negative side, it seems to chew through batteries.  In fact I actually reported the first one Amazon shipped as defective as it stopped working after 5 days.  Turns out the batteries I swapped were dead too and there was nothing wrong with the toothbrush after all.  My bad.  The fresh batteries I installed only lasted maybe 3 weeks or so.  I'm going to use rechargeables from now on, but just be forewarned that this thing gobbles batteries.<br /><br />But in terms of the operation of the toothbrush I love it.  In the short time I had to use a regular toothbrush waiting for this to arrive I felt like I had trench mouth.  No matter how long or how vigorously I would brush my teeth just never felt clean, and by 10AM if felt like I hadn't brushed in days.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I buy everything I review. To receive FIVE stars, a product must meet &#62;90% of the manufacturer's claims. I don’t subtract because I don’ t like the color or appearance (too subjective and personal). I review form, function, ease of use, and construction quality. Please forgive typos: I’m an evidence-based scientist, NOT a typist. If you find my review helpful, please click &#34;YES&#34;. This helps me improve future evaluations (which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions).<br /><br />Their Claim:  Controls the itch of psoriasis<br /><br />My Verdict (details below):  True for most people<br /><br />As a physician, I know how itchy this condition can be on your scalp. I recommend coal tar shampoo to all my patients. Most dandruff shampoos use salicylic acid (which is aspirin) for the itching, which is NOT very good at stopping the itch. My wife has tried that with NO success. Coal tar is much better at controlling it and is the active ingredient in most topical creams for psoriasis of the skin. It's available in higher strengths by prescription, but this product at 2.5% is sufficient for most scalps.<br /><br />Just use it 3x/week for adequate control. Let it sit in the scalp for five minutes, which means apply immediately upon entering the shower, then do your stuff. Just before exiting, wash it out. It's okay to leave some in the scalp; it won't hurt you. You may wish to use shampoo after, but this has shampoo/conditioner in it and in my experience, using other hair products is counterproductive.<br /><br />This tingles, so you know it's working. The only problem? It's nearly impossible to find in stores, and is often sold out at Amazon. Other companies make similar products. Just type COAL TAR SHAMPOO in the search bar to find others. They all have 2.5-3% coal tar. You need a script for 5% for some idiotic reason. What, you're going to get addicted to the stuff and overdose? The FDA is a real killer sometimes.<br /><br />If you itch, here's the product for you if you can find it. Denorex does a lousy job of marketing this product.", "output": "Great for psoriasis"}

If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that’s not a bad value on a per use basis— but about $50 for 4 of these is more money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can’t see any way to refill them.

The set of 4 larger bottles also comes with 50 nail stickers.<br /><br />These are the colors that you get:<br />Gold glitter (a small and a large bottle)<br />Baby blue (small and large bottle)<br />Baby pink (small and large bottle)<br />Violet (small and large bottle)<br /><br />Additional small bottles:<br />A slightly brighter baby pink<br />A deeper pink<br /><br />I took a photo to show you that the polish is the correct consistency and I applied it to my nails easily.

If you're doing debating as well, seriously just buy it. Its less than 10 bucks and definitely worth using on your ears or other pierced areas. I have very sensitive skin so when I went up a size before I got the balm, my ears would be irritated for weeks to a little over a month. They would constantly be hot, itchy, dry and clear discharge would be oozing down my neck. GROSS! I even waited 10 months to go up a size and that was only at the 12G-10G stage.<br /><br />2 days after I got the balm, I prepped my ears after a shower. Rubbed the balm generously over my left ear and on the taper. There was very minimal tugging and it did not make me cringe. Took less than a minute to get the taper in compared to before, taking over 5 minutes of twisting, pushing, & massaging to get the taper in w/out the balm. Took no more than 5 days to &#34;fully heal.&#34; No dry, flaky, irritated, oozing ear. Waited 6 months this time around to size up to 2G.<br /><br />At the same time, my right ear was already infected because I had to replace my plug but I was out in public and only had a spare in my purse. I cleaned it as best as I can but it didnt work. My ear felt like it was back to its newly stretched phase- cracked skin, bump under the ear and clear discharge constantly flowing down. Cleaned my plugs and my ear with salt water then rubbed the balm all over. It started to heal up faster than it did when all I had was salt water & vitamin E oil.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who's trying to stretch their ears.", "output": "DONT WAIT AS LONG AS I DID!"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "UPDATE 10/13/14 I had originally rated this item a five stars and I've left my original review unedited because it was accurate HOWEVER I've changed the rating to three stars because of the following.<br /><br />I've found that when I use this product to repair a broken, or pealing or split nail, when its freshly applied, it's awesome BUT when a few days go by and the product starts to get old it starts to lift and the problem is that even being very careful, if the product peals from the nail, IT TAKES A FEW LAYERS OF THE NATURAL NAIL WITH IT and that's what I was one of the things I was trying to prevent when I applied this product...What I ended up doing was soaking off the remainder of this product and patching the now really damaged area of my nail with ASP Fiberglass<br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=asp%20fiberglass&sprefix=ASP+fi%2Caps%2C272 and two layers of brush on nail glue which is the method I plan to continue using from now on since it does not lift and tear my nails...http://www.amazon.com/Spilo-MISC-Bondini-Plus-Brush-On/dp/B0002Z8SE8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413205777&sr=8-1&keywords=brush+on+nail+glue.<br /><br />Although I bought mine at my local Sally's, this product is so awesome, I had to come an give it a thumbs up!<br /><br />Now let me say that I have natural nails that tend to break at the base (bead) of the nail & so cutting them is not a painfree option nor a pretty one at that ;)<br /><br />The only reason why I use all three products (listed below) is to repair broken nails, to give them time to grow out while I get to have pretty, all the same length nails ;)<br /><br />This \"light less gel\" has a thicker consistency than brush on glue, which by the way, was the method I was using prior to coming across this gem in a YouTube tutorial video.<br /><br />Now it does not come with a brush applicator so I took an empty nail polish bottle, cleaned it out & I filled it with pure acetone to prevent the brush from getting hard; & that's the brush I use to apply this gel.  Just make sure to wipe the brush a few time on a napkin before using to wipe off the acetone.<br /><br />After I've removed the old nail polish, I wipe my nail clean with either an alcohol pad or some acetone. I then cut an appropriate piece of the fiberglass to cover the break.  I apply the fiberglass to the clean nail & I apply a thin line of this gel over the patch, then I take my handy, dandy nail polish brush & I spread out a thin layer of the gel over the entire nail, same as if I was applying nail polish.  Then I spray the Gel Cure (which is a god sent because it dries this thick gel almost instantly) & voila! the nail is as good as not, well you know ;) Now depending on the size of the break, use your judgement to determine if you need a 2nd layer.  This method last more than the regular nail glue & as such, soaking it off will take a little more time but who cares as long as your nail has time to grown without suffering from either pain or an odd looking manicure ;)<br /><br />When you add the cost of the fiberglass, the gel & the cure, you are looking at approximately $30 BUT this will last a long, long, long time so for me its cost effective.<br /><br />If you have natural nails that tend to split, these items are a must.  These are staples in my \"manicure rescue arsenal\".<br /><br />Highly recommended items for sure!<br /><br />I bought this \"light less gel\", the<br /><br />ASP Gel Cure<br />http://www.amazon.com/ASP-Gel-Cure/dp/B00IYPRZOW/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1402513514&sr=1-3&keywords=lightless+gel<br /><br />& the ASP All Season Nail Fiberglass Nail Wrap<br />http://www.amazon.com/All-Season-Nail-Fiberglass-Wrap/dp/B0064TPMIQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1402513563&sr=1-1&keywords=nail+fiberglass<br /><br />UPDATE 7/3/14<br />Just wanted to point out that should you decide to yank off this product with you teeth or if you are a \"picker\", be prepared to lose a layer or two of your natural nail. WHICH MEANS DAMAGING YOUR NAIL UNTIL IT GROWS OUT WHICH DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING AND APPLYING THIS PRODUCT.  This product should be removed with a cotton ball soaked in acetone, wrapped in aluminum foil for about ten to fifteen minutes so as to remove the product safely WITHOUT damaging your nail. But it truely does last longer than regular nail glue.  FYI! ;)", "output": "ASP Lightless Gel is awesome for repairing a broken natural nail, a must have!"}

That is all I needed daily, plus a medicated makeup in a tube with a tiny tip to spot cover any blemishes.  Clean face with Neutrogena soap and that was it.  Coty Blush stick was much larger than this one, and almost exactly the same consistency and color as the Pink Lemonade. It cost only $6 for the nice 4 inch pink twist-up tube. As I said before I LOVE the product.  The reason I took away two stars is that you get so much packaging and so little actual blush stick.  It is about 3/4 inch in diameter and less than a half inch stick height.  You would think you are getting about two inches in the twist-up container, but NO, they fool you.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "This is a large UV-protected BPA-free plastic bottle. I've been slathering it all over myself to see what effect it had topically. I personally like the smell-it's a soft wheaty-flaxy-earthy smell. It smells like something real which is what it is; nothing else but the real cold-pressed oil. I also like the taste which is similar to the smell. I haven't tried it yet but think it might be able to be used as the oil in salad dressings- if you like the taste. As to the topical effect well first it just sits on your skin but after a minute or two it just disappears into your skin which continues to smell faintly of the smell I mentioned above. I think it does the job of softening skin- a sort of hydrating, softening effect on my hands which already were fine so the effect isn't noticeably apparent. My feet seem to be loving this stuff (put socks on after you put the oil on!) and seem to be smoother and stay that way all day. I actually bought it to eat- and from what I've read one or two teaspoons a day is a good amount for those who aren't sure if they get enough vitamin E in their diet<br /> (salad greens, whole wheat, sunflower seeds etc) I have read that vitamin E is antagonistic to estrogen so if you are on the pill you should see if this has any negative effects when taking the pill- I don't know the answer. In general too much estrogen isn't a good thing so perhaps this characteristic of vitamin E would be helpful to some- especially men who are worried about too much estrogen? Anyway you don't want to take too much of anything in particular and you can take too much vitamin E (fat soluble )but as far as I can tell that amount is more than a 'reasonable person' would think of taking anyway. I have only taken it for two days internally and already notice that my hands and feet seem to be a lot warmer and since it's supposed to be good for circulation that's to be expected. The company that makes it, Naissance, British, sourced from Scotland, has tried to make a topnotch product and I think has achieved it. I contacted the company several times with questions and they speedily answered them with friendly, helpful answers and were willing to do what was necessary to make me happy with my purchase.

I'm concerned about overheating on warmer days though, so may have to just use with some caution. But the instructions technically say only use at night, 1 hour after showing, and don't use during the day. So maybe that's why. Also I had at least followed the 1 hour after showering thing and I did not experience any stinging or pain even in the slightest that some others mentioned. Usually after showering and exfoliating your skin it might be more sensitive immediately after, so if folks are using it immediately after maybe that's why it stings? Lastly, I do use a light moisturizer on my face because my cheeks get dry. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the brand, so it is an Ives and you can figure out the rest.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "This is the fourth electric toothbrush I've owned in 7-8 years, and is by far my favorite.<br /><br />I did love my Interplak brushes, which came recommended by my dentist as having the best cleaning action, but they were not durable (hence \"brushes\" and not \"brush\"). They say the key to getting an Interplak to last is to not use toothpaste, just dip the brush head into some Listerine. Sorry, but for me that wasn't a satisfying brushing experience.<br /><br />After two Interplaks died, I moved on to Sonicare. That brush is more durable. My husband is still using it. But when I went to the dentist and told the hygienist who cleaned my teeth that I used a Sonicare, she said that must be the reason my gums were bleeding. In fact, she said pretty much every patient she sees that has bleeding gums is using a Sonicare. I don't think she means that no one can clean their teeth successfully with that brand of brush, but apparently it fails a lot of people.<br /><br />I did find the Sonicare to be a very tough toothbrush to use because of what I'll call \"the splatter factor.\" I couldn't brush some areas of my mouth very thoroughly without spraying toothpaste everywhere. I can't count the number of times I had to change my shirt after brushing in the morning. Because it was difficult to maneuver, I probably didn't brush my gums the way I should have.<br /><br />So, my dentist recommended a Braun / Oral B brush. Initially, they recommended a brush that cost more than $100. It had all kinds of bells and whistles, including a digital display that you could affix to your mirror which would tell you how well you were brushing. I decided to first try the Braun technology with this super-affordable model, partly because of my experience changing brushes over the years, and partly because the Oral B web site claimed the exact same plaque removing power (I think 97 percent) for every single brush they offer, regardless of price.<br /><br />This model has absolutely NO bells or whistles. It doesn't even have the standard LED light on the handle to show you when it's recharging. It just has one button that turns it on and off. That's all I need.<br /><br />A couple of key differences between the Sonicare and the Oral B brushes:<br /><br />1) With this Oral B brush, I can use REAL toothpaste.<br /><br />2) The entire brush head rotates, not the individual brushes. For me, this is more comfortable. It also takes the splatter factor down to about zero.<br /><br />3) Both brushes have a 2-minute timer, but whereas the Sonicare shuts off after two minutes, this Oral B brush gives a pulsing signal at two minutes and then keeps going. For me personally, this is preferred, because I rarely finish brushing in the two minutes allotted. When I'm done, I hit the power button.<br /><br />4) The standard brush head is smaller than some. That is by design -- you brush one tooth at a time rather than sweeping the brush across your teeth -- but some might prefer something with more coverage.<br /><br />It's been several months. My gums are healthier and the battery is going strong. I just bought an additional Vitality brush for my preschool-age son, who's finding it very manageable.<br /><br />My one real complaint is the same one I have had about every electric toothbrush I've owned, which is that you have to remove the brush head  and rinse off the brush mechanism after each use. If you don't, you get a raunchy build-up in that area. I guess there must be something that requires the brushes to be engineered this way, since it's the way all the manufacturers make them. Just be aware of this as you care for your brush.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: You aren't going to beat the value of this brush. It's outstanding technology at a terrific price (and the Amazon price is $3-5 less than what you'll find at retailers).", "output": "Better than Sonicare or Interplak"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "At first I thought this was going to be the solution to the problem of the original rechargeable Sonicare toothbrush with batteries that can't be replaced (my original Sonicare stopped holding a charge).<br /><br />However, after only four months (just long enough to waste money replacing the brush head!), the button began to only work erratically, and now it does not work at all (can't power the toothbrush on).<br /><br />The reviews that state that the battery compartment does not keep water out are completely true.  The battery compartment is always moist, and the batteries will begin to rust.<br /><br />I was pleased that my Eneloop batteries worked well to power the toothbrush, so I could be using rechargeable batteries, however it doesn't matter if the toothbrush itself doesn't last past 6 months.<br /><br />The batteries that came with the toothbrush lasted around a month.  The Eneloops needed charged only once in the next three months.<br /><br />Looks like the Sonicare brand just fails on too many levels, regardless of whether you are using the ultra-expensive rechargeable unit, or this unit with two AA batteries.<br /><br />[Update] Flashlights have had \"screw on\" caps for nearly one hundred hears.  The Sonicare toothbrush is the same form factor.  I have no idea why someone at Philips thought a \"clip on\" cap (vs. a screw on) would be better, ESPECIALLY for something you use with water.  I am still COMPLETELY BAFFLED by why they would use this design.  The battery compartment will ALWAYS be moist.  Being able to use rechargeable batteries is clearly superior to being stuck with the Philips Soincare charging station.  However, the fact that your batteries get wet means you will eventually ruin your batteries.  That said, I am about to purchase another one.  Being able to use your own batteries makes it a when, both for the fact that you can replace the batteries and also so that the (much more expensive) toothbrush isn't useless when the internal batteries fail after a year or so.  Unfortunately there is no better alternative at this pricep oint.", "output": "After 4 months No Longer Works"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I am one of those few people that is cursed with very fine hair that becomes oily/greasy if I do not wash it daily. I tend to avoid hair products that contain the word oil in the product description as I do not need any help in it becoming oily. I also do not use conditioner regularly due to the nature of my hair.<br />My first thoughts upon opening my package of the InstaNatural Argan Oil Shampoo, was that it was well protected by the quality seals. There is a thin plastic cover over the bottle to prevent leakage during shipment, and another quality seal that you have to remove by taking off the top of the bottle. The first thing I do when I go to buy or use a new shampoo is to smell it. When ordering hair products online, you do not get to smell before you buy and have to depend on the seller or reviews for a description of the scent. The scent of this shampoo is a clean scent. It is mild and not overwhelming. It is not a perfume smell or a fruity smell. The best way I can describe it is a nice clean mild smell.<br />I started with hair that had been washed the day before, so it was oily and ready for another wash. I wet my hair and applied about a quarter size amount to my hair. I have shoulder length hair, so I do not need much. This shampoo has an amazing lather to it. It is thick and you can really feel it working through your hair. I scrubbed it in from the scalp to the ends. Then I rinsed. I am one of those that needs to feel/hear the squeak when I am rinsing to know my hair is really clean. And this shampoo passed that test very well. I did not use any conditioner afterwards, because I do not normally, unless it is a weekly treatment.<br />I usually air dry my hair, and I did this time as well. My hair came out so soft and full of body and did not have any heavy feeling to it. I woke up this morning without the greasy/oily feel I usually get the next day after I wash. I was very surprised by this, because like I said that is normally what my hair feels like unless I wash it daily. It is still soft and feels silky to the touch.<br />I had my fiance do the sniff test to see what he thought of the smell, and he said it smelled nice.<br />If you are like me and have been avoiding any shampoos because of the description having oil in it, I would say to give this one a try. It is like a clarifying shampoo with just the right amount to give your hair the softness that it needs without weighing it down.<br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review.", "output": "Great for fine limp hair"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I just bought this from Sally's today and use it a little bit ago. I waited until my hair was completely dry before I left a review. This stuff is absolutely amazing! I know Amazon's not going to count this as a verified review since I did not buy it from here which is why I left the picture. I'll give a bit of a backstory of my hair. I ended up falling on the Ombre train and figured I could do it at home. Big mistake! My hair was completely and utterly fried. It has been 9 months and I have used every single thing under the sun to try and keep my hair soft. I have bought masks off of Amazon, Walmart, Sally's Beauty, eBay, Dillons, and any other store that I can find. All of them worked fairly well while my hair is still damp, but after it dries it becomes a bit crunchy again. I really wish I would have taken a before picture of my ends. I could literally hold them and they would stand up straight. This stuff eliminate everything. I have done that extra protein, soy, coconut oil, argan oil, everything you could think of and nothing helped. My hair feels completely healthy and so , so soft again. I'm naturally curly so I have to deal with frizz. After using this, my hair has a natural shine to it (not the oily kind that many hair masks do) My fruzz is under control and my curls are actually separated. I already have an order of this on the way. I know there's only two reviews on this and if I had seen it I would have bypassed it. If you have dry, crunchy, stringy, or unhealthy hair I cannot recommend this enough! I am so thankful that the lady at Sally's recommend this to me", "output": "Just get it!"}

My hair has never gotten so straight so quickly without being burned. In the video you can see how quick it goes from damp with a thermal protector in my hair to straight from scalp to end with just a few quick strokes. That probably took me an eighth of the time it normally takes me and that is no joke!<br />I've used hot combs: the ones that you plug in and the old school ones that go straight off the stove on to your hair with embers sparking my hair and everything. I've used ceramic and different metal plated flat irons. I've spent hundreds of dollars on irons and I spent $30 on irons, and this has got to be the most awesome invention for hair straightening yet! I even was desperate enough one time that I used a clothes iron on my hair to get done quicker. It shaved a couple of hours off but wasn't worth the damage and the scalp that I couldn't get that close too.<br />I like how you can see what the temperature is and you can put it on the temperature that you would prefer. It's really easy to read and lots of really bright. The buttons are easy to push and are clearly labeled. Don't be alarmed when you first look at the bristles. It doesn't look like it would come very well because it looks so rubbery, but it really does a great job. As you can see in the video, I still brushed before I used the straightening brush, only because I wanted to have is a little heat on my hair as possible and I didn't want to be worrying about tangles. That's another thing, when I straighten my hair, I go back and forth constantly with a brush or comb and the flat iron to make sure I'm not heating the hair in a awkward position. This took the need of that intermediate comb or brush between the heat process. It made it so much quicker and I am so happy to have this brush!<br />You can see in the pictures of my daughters hair and in the video how close I'm able to get to the scalp. It works so well and it's really convenient. The only thing that I would change is how hot the back of the brush gets. It's hard to figure out how to play put it down without having a holder available. I put it on a towel on the bed, and it got pretty hot. So if there was a way for them to put a different material it on the back, it would be absolutely perfect! I definitely can say I highly recommend the straightener and I hope my review helps you in your decision.<br />I received the straightening comb at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "output": "the best straightener I've ever had"}

I feel like I am much more organized than I was and it also looks much nicer.  I like that the drawers are clear so that I can see what is in each drawer.  The little black pieces in the bottom of each drawer help to keep your items from sliding around when you open and close the drawers.  They are also stackable to I took the bottom drawers from each set and stacked them on top of each other to make a bigger tower.  This piece is well made and arrived wrapped nicely so that it wasn't damaged during shipping.  I was able to order this at a discounted price in return for fair and honest feedback.  I rely heavily on feedback when selecting new items and I am always honest and unbiased in mine.  I will update reviews as needed.", "output": "Great for organization!!"}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I bought this makeup remover because I wanted something different than the disposable wipes that I was using.  I like that this towel is chemical free and much cheaper than continuing to by packages of wipes. I have seen a similar product on sale in stores for a lot more money so I decided to try this one. It's very soft. I love the way it feels against my skin. I really like that I can use it and then hang it up to dry and reuse it for about a week before I toss it in the washing machine. After it dries, it is still soft unlike a regular washcloth that gets hard and stiff. It does get makeup marks on it, especially from my mascara, but they come out in the wash.  I was curious as to whether the towel actually took off all of my makeup when compared to a prepackaged wipe so I used a wipe after I used this makeup remover. There was very little makeup on the wipe. I was very pleasantly surprised. I also like that the makeup remover is rectangular instead of the small square shape that some of the similar products are. It has more surface area which makes it easier to remover my makeup. The only thing that I wish this one had is a small loop at one end to hang it up by. Right now I just hang it over my towel rack to dry. I was able to try this makeup remover ata discounted price in return for fair and honest feedback.

Lavender is one of the most popular scents for use around the home and is really good to use in making various home green cleaning and beauty recipes. This oil comes in a brown glass bottle with a glass dropper and rubber and plastic lid that can be exchanged for the plain lid that it comes with. The smell on this is very potent which is good so when you mix it with other carrier oils or soaps it doesn't get lost in those. My mom liked using this as a perfume while she was here visiting me as well. The scent is exactly what you would expect it to smell like for lavender and I feel it is not synthetic as I am sensitive to man made fragrances and they tend to get my allergies going.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I purchased these at a discount to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. These come as one big grouping rubber banded at the top together. I marked this down a star for two reasons, one I wish the color groupings were banded separately because trying to pick through and find just the one (or ones you want) only made us tangle the hair more and we had to stop and comb it to untangle it. Having them packaged separately instead as one big grouping would have saved us this trouble. The other reason is because the colored crimp rings that come with them has a clear plastic or rubber ring inside them that must be removed for the extension to fit through. The instructions said nothing about this and I was getting frustrated on the first one I did thinking it wasn't going to fit until I knocked that clear inside ring out of the way and then it worked fine. Neither of these are deal breakers for potentially buying these for my teen in the future again, but they would be nice improvements!<br /><br />This came with three colors of crimp beads which is nice for different colors of hair to help blend it into the roots. Everything you need is included except a pair of pliers which most households have in their basic or crafting tool kits. I put one in my teenaged daughters hair to show her how to do it, and after that she found it easy enough to do in both her and other peoples hair. They go in and seem pretty durable since they are synthetic. The color will last longer than a real dye job will. The colors are bright and fun. She has brushed and washed her hair multiple times without any issues with the extension.", "output": "Easy to put into the hair, comes with everything you need except pliers."}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I received this cuticle pusher for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. So I was a bit skeptical about this cuticle pusher because all I have ever used are the bamboo stick ones which dull very quickly and it seems I'm always purchasing, the cost was adding up so I haven't bought them in awhile and try to make do with what I have. This did seem like a bit much to pay for, but when you think about what you are saving in costs of disposables and how many years this one will last you it is not as bad as I had thought. Now prices always change on here so it may be a different amount when you look into purchasing it so just do the same thing, weigh the cost of buying disposables with how much it is currently selling for.<br /><br />Now when it arrived it came in a plastic slip cover that you can keep it clean while being stored. It's simple and cheap, but I didn't mark it down because it's considered packaging. Something a little more durable would have been good. I'm not sure how long it will last before it starts to tear at the seams from taking the pusher in and out.<br /><br />The pusher itself is all metal which is really nice as it means you can toss it in the dishwasher or a pot of boiling water to sanitize it often which is a good idea since it's not disposable and your hands, especially your nails carry a ton of germs! The end is flat enough and slightly rounded or smoothed off at the end so that it does not feel sharp against your skin at all. I was worried since I'm used to softer wood that the metal would be painful to use but it really hasn't been each time I've used it. It will work on the cuticles themselves, but I highly recommend soaking your hands in a bit of warm/hot (what you can tolerate or enjoy) slightly soapy water with a few drops of essential oil (again of your liking) in it for some moisturizing and cleaning. This will help to soften them up and make them easier to slide back. Once your done put a bit of oil or other cuticle moisturizer or cream on to keep them feeling good! Whenever you use lotion make sure to rub a bit into the cuticles to keep them feeling soft and good, or if you really have the time use the specialized cuticle creams or lotions every day on them!<br /><br />Once I'm done if I had washed my hands really well and soaked them I might not sanitize this each time like you really should, but I will every few uses or if I picked it up and just started pushes at my dry cuticles without thinking about it or washing my hands!", "output": "It all metal, easy to sanitize and actually works to push my cuticles back."}

So I got the polka dot brush figuring it would be good for either of my kids. However when it came it was immediately claimed by my husband. Just a few days before we had been discussing my brush that he uses as well and how he uses it but it wasn't exactly what he wanted. Funny this would come days later and it totally was what he was thinking when we had that discussion without knowing I had ordered it!<br /><br />He likes that it fits in the palm of his hand nicely and is comfortable to control around his head. He has shorter hair that is slightly curly, he likes that this brush has short hard plastic bristles that manages his hair without causing static. It also brushes his hair easily into the directions he wants it to go when he is styling it. He doesn't have long hair that tangles so he can't say how it works there, but he really likes how it works on his short hair.<br /><br />Since he couldn't answer that I tried it and had my 6th grade son try it in his hair that is longer.

I like that it isn't too heavy on my hair, glides easily and softens my hair after I've used the shampoo. I don't feel like it's causing any grease or oil on my hair.  The container is also HUGE.  This is easily the size of 3 regular containers of intense conditioner.  The only problem I have (the bottle is pretty too) is that I can't really tell that my hair is growing faster than it was with other hair products. I see no difference in my hair length.  I just don't. My hair feels a little more healthy but nothing substantial. I would pay around $14 for this hair growth treatment because I do like the smell and it doesn't make my hair unhealthy. I just don't see the results I expected. I give it 3 stars for being a good conditioner but had to knock off two stars because I'm not seeing growth.<br /><br />The jar is an amusing shower read.

My issues are t-zone congestion and my skin’s texture isn’t smooth. I’m in my mid 30s so I’m trying to get on the anti-aging boat lol. I really like that this has a heat feature. However, It takes about 1 minute 30<br />seconds to heat up so I’ll let it run and do something else. Wen it shuts off then I turn it on again and actually use it. Also the heat is mild. The device makes my skin super smooth and is gentle on the skin. I have combo/normal skin and I can’t stop touching my face. I wake up the next morning and my skin is still smooth. I started using it once a day, then twice a day but switched to once every three days on the lowest setting. My skin is still smooth so I don’t want to overdo it. You will see redness but it goes away fairly quickly. I wet my face, I wet the device and add my cleanser directly it. You can use less cleanser because the device distributes it nicely. This seems to work best with a cream cleanser. It stays on for 2 minutes but 1 minute should suffice. It doesn’t have a beep to let you know when to switch sections. The last setting that dries the device is a nice touch. I only get water on the bristles so I can’t speak on it being waterproof.

Let me assure you, this stuff is AH-mazing! And not only that, it's curly girl approved! Allow me to give you some background on my hair type before I review the shampoo and conditioner individually. I have very long, very thick, highly porous, somewhat dry, very frizzy, naturally curly hair. My curly hair type is about a 3A/3B. Now about the shampoo. The shampoo is completely sulfate and silicone free (I don't use sulfates or silicones in my hair), and while washing my hair the very first time, it actually felt like it was moisturizing my hair while actually getting it clean, and not stripping my hair at all. Like, that's quite a trifecta! I've found that a lot of sulfate free shampoos don't leave your hair feeling quite clean, but this one really does. That shampoo doesn't smell like much, it smells fresh, but doesn't have a powerful odor at all. The conditioner, however, is amazing! I wasn't expecting much from it because it has so few ingredients, which are mostly oils, but holy cow, this stuff felt amazing on my hair! A lot of silicone free conditioners don't have much slip, so it makes detangling your hair in the shower a bit difficult, but this was super easy, my fingers glided right through my hair, my hair felt silky, and best of all, it didn't take a ton of product to achieve this effect like it does with a lot of conditioners. The conditioner definitely has more of an herbal scent to it, but it's a pleasant one that I enjoy, and I don't think it's objectionable to anyone. All this being said, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this shampoo and conditioner set, I think I'm a convert for life!<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

First off they have some of the best smelling beard grease(balm) ive tried and I’ve tried a good dozen brands. Their spice scent is legit heaven. Probably my favorite but all their scents are amazing. I’d have to rank spice as my #1 though it smells like a good fall season scent which I love #2 is a tie between the other 3 scents(black tie, whiskey tobacco, and wilderness)  becuase they’re just so good and I like them all equally and that’s rare, usually I’ll only like 1 or 2 scents from a company. I’m picky. The feel to the beard grease is also high quality it’s a thick creamy consistency that melts in your hands fast and isn’t real greasy which is ironic since the name would imply that it would be greasy. It seems to make my beard look more dense and thick as well. The hold is great it lays my beard better than all the others and that’s just the original compound so I bet rugged hold version is even better on taming which I’m gonna try and write a review on. Also the package arrived way faster than I expected it to which is a plus. I took the time to review them because I genuinely love their products and they have great customer service. I have nothing negative to say or any constructive criticism because everything is done right by this company. 5 star on everything for them. Also if you buy from their website you get free shipping if you spend $15. This is my new favorite brand and I plan on buying their entire product line.", "output": "Some of the best scents in the game, great hold and consistency."}

I didn’t read the description very closely, because they are shorter than I expected, but that’s my fault….the listing clearly says they are 39 inches, which they are. Actually that worked out better for the worship team than long ones since they are all standing on stage, close to each other.<br />The colors are not what I was expecting, they are much better. They come in random colors and we got gold, red, blue, green and hot pink. They are much brighter and more vibrant than the pictures would lead you to believe.<br />I really like that the handle has some weight to it. It didn’t come into play for our purposes, but if you’re doing gymnastics, having the weight in the handle makes tosses much more predictable. The handle will always fall first and vertically so it is easy to catch.<br />All in all, a great product!<br /><br />I received these gymnastic rhythmic ribbons at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "output": "Great little ribbons"}

All in all - I wouldn't buy it again because I really don't like how tightly curled/frizzy it is - some may like this look.

I did not pay attention on the size when I made the order. But it is smaller than when most scrubs I used to see in the store. The packaging is ok. The seller tried to protect the item in the box. However, the bottle I got is either opened before or not sealed well. The oil inside is leaking. I have to clean the bottle before I put it on my table. I am disappointed on this situation. Not enough oil is left inside to keep the sea salt moist. And when I opened the scrub, the smell of grapefruit is not strong and is not natural. It is not smells like natural fruit. It is ok for me since the smell will not stay anyway after I clean my skin after apply it. The good part I like of this scrub is that after apply it, I do feel my skin is more smooth. Right now, the sea salt in my bottle is kind of dry because of the oil leak. Maybe it will be better if you luckily get a good one. However, you need to pay attention that this product is not that gentle to the skin. I do not recommend using this product on our very soft and sensitive area. It will be good for hands, knees, feet and maybe legs. BUT NOT FACE even though it says for body and face. I will not use it on my face. When applying it on the skin, please do it very gentle so it does not hurt. Overall, this is an average performed body scrub.

I wasn't sure if it was because the on/off was marked on the lid but not the tube, maybe I just turned it the wrong amount? ½ turn seemed reasonable, so I turned it tighter and more came out the sides. For what it's worth, the instructions just have us dabbing a couple dots on with the sponge and blending with the fingers or brush. The sponge is an entirely unnecessary addition.<br /><br />As you can see from the photo, this did allow me to put a nice and thick layer on my arm just in case anyone is looking to see how dramatic it can be. I do like the color, it's a good match, but I wouldn't use it on my eyes or my lips because the product says 'liquid blush.' There is a graphic on this page that says 2-in-1, despite showing eyes/blush/lips on the very same graphic, which I am pretty sure would be 3-in-1.<br /><br />The last issue is the ingredients. The top ingredient is Ethylhexyl Palmitate, which is a pretty well known comedogenic (pore clogging) problem, so it's not great if you have breakouts. That's why I don't know how long it lasts or well it holds up over time, it's not worth the high risk of breakouts so I didn't wear it long. You might have guessed that 'palmitate' is also a derivative of Palm Oil, which is an industry that is destroying many biodiverse forests.<br /><br />Two stars for color, texture feels nice, but I would only recommend this to people with clear skin that don't really have any desire to use the applicator sponge.", "output": "Palm oil - pore clogging - failed applicator"}

After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* It gives a great shave! They've changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.<br /><br />* It's quiet. I can actually have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn't possible with my older shaver.<br /><br />* It is significanly lighter than my older model.<br /><br />* Cleanup is really easy. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you're supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.<br /><br />* It's hard to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you'll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This isn't nearly as handy.<br /><br />* The shape isn't as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it's wet. It doesn't feel very good in your hand.<br /><br />* There is no case to store it in. This is a drawback if you use it to travel.<br /><br />* The head is supposed to be replaced once a year. Huh??? This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers. These heads aren't cheap, folks. I certainly wouldn't replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I'd probably buy a new one.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'm very pleased with this shaver. It does the job very well and it was quite inexpensive. I would certainly recommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.", "output": "Great shave, light, easy clean up, slow to charge"}

I had requested it because shaving with a regular razor (Mach 3) had become too painful.  I have a very sensitive neck and the Mach 3 would leave me with razor burn and other facial bumps.  So, I just finished my 21-day trial and here are the results:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)  Much easier on my face.  My bumps/razor burn are healing nicely.<br />2)  Very easy to clean.  Just run it under water for a few seconds after each use.<br />3)  Holds charge well.  I have used the razor everyday for the past 21 days, about 10 minutes a day.  I have charged the razor 3 times, including the initial charge.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)  Shave is not as close as the Mach 3.  I'm sure this is to be expected, but this razor also misses several hairs on my neck not matter how many times I go over them.  However, the razor does perform much better on the flatter portions of my face.<br />2)  No battery indicator.  It ran out on me the other morning halfway through my shave.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this razor.  Don't expect it to cut as close as a Mach 3 though.", "output": "Nice shaver!"}

I accidentally got too much of Solution B, and got a negative result on something I knew had nickel. Also, you have to really rub hard for 15+ seconds, and then you see a FAINT, faint pink on the cotton swab. It's very subtle.<br /><br />It would have been helpful if the makers included something to use as a \"positive control\", something that contained nickel so you could see what a positive test looks like and know what you're looking for while testing unknown items. I highly suggest that users find their own positive control - find something you know has nickel, and test that to see the pink and know you're doing it right.<br /><br />Also, this seems to release ammonia gas when the solutions are mixed, so use in a well-ventilated area, and don't put your face right over the swab or item being tested or you'll get a whiff of ammonia in your nose/eyes.<br /><br />As it turns out, real surgical grade stainless steel does test NEGATIVE for nickel! (And I tried really, really hard to get a result on that one!) I was using this test kit to double-check my earring-making components to make sure there was no nickel content for making hypoallergenic earrings. Again, I HIGHLY recommend using a positive control (and perhaps a negative non-nickel control as well) to make sure your results are real and valid.", "output": "Works with a little elbow grease, FAINT results"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I like this little manicure and pedicure travel set. I got it for my boyfriend mainly, since he grows his nails out too long and never bothers to trim or style them. I tend to bite my nails also, so I use the file to file them down and keep myself from doing that so much. The travel case is really cute and can easily fit in a purse or a glove compartment. The set is really nice, and has plenty of different pieces in it, some of which I don't really need to use. My boyfriend's main complaint, and mine as well, was the size of the 'large' nail clipper. It's smaller than any 'large' nail clipper I've ever seen. It's longer than the smaller one included, and a bit thicker, but it's not wider than it at all. It's entirely too small to work on toenails, especially my boyfriend's. Overall, it's a good little set, and that's my only complaint.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "output": "The large nail clipper is nearly as small as the small one"}

He'd always come out of the bathroom with his neck looking like he was just attacked, and I finally decided to do something about it. After a bit of research I decided to get him this, a safety razor, and some shaving soap for sensitive skin. So far he really likes this. This brush makes a good lather and spreads well on his skin. It's easy to rinse and use, and the bristles exfoliate his skin, helping him have a smooth, clean shave. Overall, we really like this product and would highly recommend it.", "output": "Lathers great, rinses easily, and exfoliates the skin"}

I would even go as far to say that they do a better job than a cotton cloth with soap on it. I have sensitive skin so using harsh soaps or cleansers is not an option for me. Typically I would struggle to get my mascara completely removed. I would always end up with raccoon eyes requiring me to scrub harder than I would like on the delicate skin below my eyes and I don’t even use waterproof mascara. That problem is a thing of the past now that I have these washcloths. I am able to remove all my makeup with minimal effort and no scrubbing.<br /><br />The cloths are very soft and feel good against your skin whether they are wet or dry. I used one the other day as a sweat rag while I was working out because they are so absorbent; it worked great. The stitching looks solid and they have a nice thick feel to them. I haven’t been using them long enough to run them through the wash but they feel very well made so I am not worried about them falling apart in the wash. I thought they would collect so much makeup that I would need to wash them after almost every use but that is not the case a quick rinse in clean water and they are good to go.<br /><br />The color is true to the picture displayed although I would call it closer to sea foam green than blue.<br /><br />My only complaint is I could do without the rather large tag that stretches across the corner. I will probably look at the stitching a little closer to see if I can safely remove it without ruining them.<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I have always coveted long nails, but with weak, bendy nails that peal and break easily it was never achievable. I'm a DIY girl when it comes to nails. I have been doing my own gel manicures for years and most recently have been using Brisa lite smoothing gel for added strength. It helped but manicures still started chipping at the 10 day mark and as soon as my nails got to the desired length they would start breaking.<br />By comparison this stuff is amazing! Its all the strength without the bulk of regular acrylic. They are my real nails but nothing will break them.The process itself is faster since you don't have to cure for two minutes each time. The coats between and after powder are just thin glue. Its also more forgiving as the coats are all even and solidly applied. You buff and clean up in the middle of the process which makes everything even and your edges perfect. I've also filed and such after they are done without issue.<br />I actually ordered from Revel itself, but read the reviews here first. Revel colors are also cheaper then gel's options, with a one ounce jar of color only costing about $8. One ounce jar is probably like 8-10 manicures. Sure beats paying a salon $40 every two weeks.<br />Removal is slightly different. I use the cotton ball with nail caps method and find it slightly more time consuming then gel, but I think that's only because I'm still getting used to it. When exposed to acetone the dip turns into a chewed gum consistency. So unlike my CND shellac that peals off I'm rubbing off sticky blobs. But I also probably just need to try soaking it an extra 5 minutes and stop being impatient.<br />But the extra removal time is totally worth it when you consider the manicures last longer, are stronger, and allow me to finally have my dream long nails.", "output": "All the strength of traditional arylic without the bulk or salon.

To clean it out, the head can be twisted and popped off, then cleaned out with a brush included in the battery compartment. (Turns out the Panasonic's head also twists off for better cleaning access, but I never knew that until I tried it tonight.)<br /><br />Of the two, the Maswater runs more quickly than the Panasonic on the same AA battery, which is good for finishing promptly. The Maswater also includes a very dim built-in LED light, though I couldn't imagine that helping me in any way while trimming hairs from either my nose or ears.<br /><br />The real test will be how long the Maswater continues to run quickly.

The bristles were made from boars’ hair and the handle from bamboo. Nylon bristles came about around 1938. Today, some toothbrushes still use boar’s bristles, however, some say there are concerns about the action of the natural bristles on the enamel and gums, so many still recommend soft nylon bristles. Here, we have a natural bamboo handle, which is sturdy and durable, with little to no bend and very smooth, so someone took time to sand this down. The bristles are very soft. Which is easy on the gums and enamel. The toothbrush head and handle are perfect for a little one’s mouth, allowing access to those small to reach places. Practicing good oral hygiene is so important, at a young age. Our little one found this toothbrush perfect in size to maneuver about and the bristles comfortable. We see no shedding of a single bristle at this early stage; and plan to rotate this out of commission, after its effectiveness appears of concern, after a bad cold, or just after so many months of service. With that in mind, cost is always a concern. These are no bargain basement toothbrushes. They are a premium product in our opinion and are priced accordingly.  Bamboo toothbrush handles can be composted, used as kindling, and can be repurposed for other household uses. However, just like plastic toothbrush handles, they will take up space in a landfill if just thrown away. We reconsidered using plastic toothbrushes, and now choose bamboo toothbrushes as an alternative to the plastic, which ends up in landfills. Plastic is not designed to break down and plastic toothbrushes are difficult to recycle. We decided bamboo to be an excellent alternative to reduce plastic waste at home. Finally, our little one gave this bamboo toothbrush, with its cute design laser burned into the handle two (2) thumbs up for fit, having that fun handle design, unique style, soft bristle comfort, lack of odor, and ease of using. We agree.", "output": "Durable bamboo handle paired with a soft bristled brush, stop the plastic. Buy."}

I can't find another wand that makes my bangs look like they have body without actually curling them under so I am so happy that Olaxer stands behind their products and makes it right. The straightener works great to tame the cowlick and frizzies. I was so excited that it has the straightener built in so I don't have to plug in multiple devices on those days my cowlick is outta control!<br /><br />When it arrived the piece holding the cord was broken. But that didn't really harm anything so I just took it completely off and used it anyway. I'm lazy so I rarely use the straightener although it is nice when I am having a particularly frizzy day. I love the size of the wand it gives just the right amount of curl to keep my bangs from laying flat against my head.<br />I rated it two stars because even with little use the clip that holds the flattening part together so I can use the want has broken. I should have guessed it was cheaply made when the other clip thing came off. I wasn't even opening or closing it when it broke - just using the wand when suddenly it popped open and refused to shut again. This means the inside flatterer doesn't heat properly unless you hold it shut while it heats up. So now it is just a wand that you have to squeeze tightly while using so it will curl :( sigh...", "output": "Reliable Company - Very Handy and Useful Iron"}

Price point is great. Leather feels fairly soft for the price, not a super shiny finish which is what I wanted. The quality seems decent. I have one concern and one problem. Concern is that the straps will deteriorate over time with all the sliding through the metal D rings that they do. Can't confirm that'll happen but given my one or two days of use that's a concern I have. The problem I have is that the shape of the bag itself is tapered at the top. So the measurement of the bag's width is not consistent through the whole height of the and thus the opening of the bag. This makes my iPad (in a case) very tricky to get in and out. Also a problem with the top of this bag is it's zippered closure, which is a bit flimsy; I just chose not to use it at all. These two issues were deal breakers for me; I'll have to return. If I was just using it as a purse I'd be able to keep it but I'd like to fit my iPad, possibly a couple of diapers, kid stuff, etc. it's just too small and restricting for that type of use.", "output": "Not bad but not great"}

The headband is misshapen in that one side of the band is half an inch longer than the other, so that the &#34;teeth&#34; go further down on the left side than the right. This results in one side of the band presseing painfully into the bone behind my left ear (rather than resting by the soft, cartilage area behind the ear, where normal length head bands don't create any discomfort).<br /><br />3. Even the shorter side of the headband is too long for me, but the longer side is so long that it just sticks out into space. Since I wear my hair up this is decidedly unattractive, not to mention uncomfortable.<br /><br />4. I was really hoping there would be more teeth. Three or four more per side would be ideal.<br /><br />5.

I have recently gone back to work in an office after several years of working from home.  This means I actually have to do my hair more often.  After several mornings of burning my fingers, I ditched it for a new one.  And I can't get used to the gloves that you can buy to help prevent that (and never got any with that curling iron).<br />I am so happy with this purchase for a few reasons so far...I have not burned my fingers!!  That's a pretty big reason for me!!  I did receive gloves with this and I am thinking of trying them, they seem to be a better material that the ones I had before, so maybe I will get used to them.  But so far, the tip hasn't gotten so hot that it burns me.  Secondly, I like the temperature adjustment on this because you actually 'click' it with a button, the Baby Bliss has a dial which can easily get bumped during styling (making it too hot!)  So my temp stays exactly where I want it unless I change it.  And finally, the other main selling point for me was that it uses infrared light!!!  Infrared light is a penetrating light and is actually less damaging.  It isn't just heating the outside of the hair strands, and trust me it helps hold my curls longer.  I am a brunette with med thick hair, but finer strands.  Basically, my hair feels thick, but it's finer hair.  And although I have natural wavy/curly hair, for some bizarre reason, it won't hold a curl from a curling iron all day.  Strange, but true.  Overall, it seems to be a very well constructed curling iron and I am happy I am saving the health of my finger tips and my hair from damage.  I am actually going to see if they make flat irons with the infrared technology to replace my current flat iron that is acting up.", "output": "Xara 1\" Infrared professional ceramic curling iron - Love it!"}

This product does not which is great!<br />- Packaging is really nice. It comes in a cute box- so if you're gifting, this would be extremely easy to wrap or put in a gift bag.<br />- Definitely giftable! Can totally see this being a great little gift to add to any gift bag or gift box. Would even make a great stocking stuffer this coming holiday season.<br />- Consistency of the liquid is nice- it is not thick, not slimy, not super thin, and not heavy.<br />- Easy to use. The brush is similar to most liquid eyeliner brushes so it is easy to apply on your brows and/or lash line.<br /><br />I have using this for a couple of days now. I have been consistent with it and plan to continue... I haven't quite used it long enough to see \"growth\" or any difference quite yet but I will totally update this when or if I do. Though, my brows and lashes have not fallen out so I guess that is a good thing, huh? I'm sold on the no odor!<br /><br />~UPDATE - 01/14/2020<br />It has now been 2+ months of continuous recommend use and I have NOT seen a difference in eyelash length/growth nor in eyebrows. I guess it is possible that everyone will get different results, but I did not get any. Changing my review from 5 stars to 2.", "output": "NO ODOR. (did not work for me)"}
{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I unfortunately DO NOT like this product. I had high hopes for this but it is just not working for me.<br /><br />I first tried this product on the back of my hand (picture shown)... did different strokes with the pen- lighter stroke and heavier stroke, short and long. IMMEDIATELY, I noticed that the ink bleeds to where you can barely see the lines... ends up looking like a smudged streak.<br /><br />I waited 30 minutes to let the ink set, and quickly ran the back of my hand under cold water. WITHOUT even having to rub the ink (picture shown), the ink quickly faded and was nearly gone. Not sure how “waterproof” this product is.<br /><br />I’ve tried this product on my eyebrows numerous times now, and I just cannot get the ink to not bleed. Also, after applying, it’s very hard to see the lines, still ends up looking smeared. I’ve tried gently gliding the pen and even that does not work.<br /><br />Note/<br />- Pen is easy to hold<br />- Consistency comparison... The ink is “lighter” and thinner than liquid eyeliner<br /><br />This would work for someone who does not want the lines to show or for someone who doesn’t care if the ink bleeds/smudges. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend it. You’re better off flicking a liquid eyeliner pen against your eyebrows.", "output": "Wouldn’t recommend."}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I really did not know what to expect with this scrub, and was very intrigued by the idea of using brown sugar in a scrub. Initially, when I opened the jar, it really just looks like packed dry brown sugar, like you would see when you are baking and measuring it out. The smell is pure sugar, which kind of surprised me, since it has so many different oils in it. But, like I said, it is fairly dry in the jar. It is easy to scoop out, and if you spread it between your hands before scrubbing on your body, it does moisten right up, and the sugar starts to dissolve, which would be why it is such a dry scrub. I was impressed with the soft smoothness of my skin after using the scrub, considering the sugar was dissolving, but it did work. My skin has a faint sweet aroma, but, due to the initial dryness and low oil quantity in the packaging, it did not moisturize as much as I would have liked. This would be great in the spring and summer, but for the dry Iowa winters, I think I will go with something with more oils in it. Overall, nice product, and this company has yet to disappoint!", "output": "it really just looks like packed dry brown sugar"}

I looked up every ingredient listed on the back of this bottle. Some of them are things derived from coconut oil. However actual coconut oil is not an actual ingredient. There is nothing that I can find that says that this stuff has argan oil. Lastly is that supposedly has tea tree oil. I didn't even need to look anything up to know that this body wash does not have it in there. The big one being that, while the soap smells nice, it smells NOTHING like tee tree oil. Tea Tree oil has a very strong and distinct smell. I use it for a lot of stuff, so I know what it smells like. Then there is the fact that based off of glancing at the ingredients. Tea Tree oil is not listed by it's common or scientific name. So unless this company is counting the front of the bottle as part of the ingredients list, this does not contain what it says it does.

I was even more nervous! LOL. I gave my hair a quick wash in the shower (no gloves) and I did have to spray down the whole area, as everything was purple, but it rinsed right off. My hair felt squeaky afterwards (I did not condition) and when I dried it, I did notice that the brassiness was gone. I only left it in my hair for a minute or so while washing.

The first thing I noticed was that it stayed in place on my face better than the mask from a different brand I had used previously.

I found this to be pleasant and relaxing.<br /><br />The directions on the back of the packet containing the mask say to leave it on for 25-30 minutes.  From my two times experience with this product, I have to agree with that.  One time I left it on for more than 30 minutes and noticed a kind of astringent sensation on my skin.  The mask is not meant to be on for longer than 30 minutes.<br /><br />The directions written on the back of the packet are clear and easy to understand.  I was also thrilled to see that the mask is 100 percent biodegradable and cruelty free (no harsh laboratory testing on animals).<br /><br />Looking at the results afterward, my skin definitely looked less dry and felt softer.

We are still using Miaderm and she is experiencing very little inflammation to her skin (on the outside). FYI: I showed the radiation oncologist Miaderm and he looked at the ingredients list and said it has alcohol do not use it.I told him it was developed by radiation oncologist and Phase III clinical trials. And that it was not the type of drying alcohol. He would not even listen to me. He said only use aquaform (which is a petroleum based product-YUCK)otherwise \"you are going to come and say my skin is drying and blame me b/c I said it was okay to use\" He needs a refresher on chemistry - Yes the word \"alcohol\" is in the ingredients list but it is ceteryl alcohol different from the fermented alcohol that is drying. After leaving the clinic,  I pulled up the ingredient list for Aquaform and it had \"lanolin alcohol\" as an ingredient.. again it is a fatty conditioning \"alcohol\" not the drying kind-- urgh I wish I had known this to show him aquaform ingredient list!! Do not let the arrogance of doctors stop you from finding the best product for you.It is unfortunate that we can't always have doctors who will take the initiative to learn about a new product, research it, and then give us their opinion rather than just dismissing the patient.  I don't expect doctors to know the newest and best products on the market, but I do expect them to be open to learning about new products that may be helpful to their clients.", "output": "I think anything is going to be better than the zero recommendations made by her oncology team"}

While I cannot confirm that the plastic itself is any different, it simply seems more stable and sturdy.  Because of the clip and other metal used, it seems like there is less stress placed on areas that could break or wear down over time from attaching/reattaching.<br /><br />Based on my experience with this size, I would be interested in a 1 and 1.5 guard from the professional series.

And they had tried EVERYTHING, with no relief at all. I have known for some years about the healing powers of colloidal silver in all of its many forms.  So I sent them both a couple of jars of this cream to apply to their rashes. In fact, I sent them multiple options of topical and internal “natural”/non-pharma remedies to try.  (Because that is my thing, and they knew it.).  Both have reported back to me that it gave them literal IMMEDIATE, though not permanent, relief from the pain and itching when they apply this cream - so much so that they have re-ordered in larger quantities.  The rash is much improved, and far better than it was, but so far, after more than a month, not completely cured. They are still quite grateful to have this cream to provide relief when the rash flares up again.  And it seems to be the only thing that does help, after trying numerous remedies, including from the doctor. That is what I can tell you about this cream.", "output": "EXCELLENT for HEALING and for pain and itchy rash"}

Other stencils packs have had fewer selection of eyebrow stencils and they are too big for my face.<br />2. They have two stencils of the same shape!  I have never had a stencil kit with this.  That way you use one for one eyebrow, and a different stencil for the other.  With other kits you have to use the same stencil and wipe it of makeup, otherwise you get unwanted makeup on your face.<br /> 2. Other stencils have this space across them that you have to fill in at the arch.  I am not sure why they are all have this.  These stencils do not have that space that I have to fill in, so I literally stamp and done.<br /><br />This is very easy to use. I love it!", "output": "Great Product!"}

The closest comparison I can make to this product is the Klairs 2 in 1 cotton pads. Klairs gives you two different kinds of cotton pads in a box, one of which is sponge-y and the other which is good for exfoliation.  I liked the Klairs pads, but I couldn't find an option that would let me purchase *just* the sponge-y ones. It was very annoying, because then I'd end up with a bunch of exfoliating pads I didn't want to use. These Silcot pads are the same as the Klairs sponge pads but even better! So happy I found these!

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I bought this because the seller listed the main ingredients as argan oil and resvesterol, when in fact the product is full of silicon and demethicone is listed before argan oil. I can see why there are rave reviews from other users.  This will give your hair a great TEMPORARY shine and silky soft feel but will end up robbing it of shine shortly and prevent your hair from absorbing moisture. You are not coating your hair with Arian oil but a rubber derivative. So th cuticle lays down short term but never gets the moisture that is causing the damage and frizz to begin with. I think someone who has science in their name would know that. Long term demethicone use will cause more drying and damage and is not good for your hair.<br /><br />I had actually wanted to use this product on my face, not hair because of the resvesterol. But it has an extremely strong scent of sandalwood that is overpowering and I would never be able to use it on my face.<br /><br />The bottle arrived in a box but leaked all over. I would have returned anyway because of the demethicone and smell. I bought pure cold pressed argan oil to use instead. It smells naturally like poo as all of them do but the smell dissipates in a few minutes.<br /><br />I do think the seller should make its ingredients clear to prospective buyers and not just list the deceptive &#34;main ingredients&#34; omitting the ingredients that are listed first when the package actually arrives and therefore are really the main ingredients.", "output": "More silicone than argan oil.

Be aware there are no small brushes in this such as an eyeliner or brow brush, these are all decent size brushes though the bristles are a bit short on the larger brushes and I will use these more for blending. The handles are long enough that they feel good in my hand, I prefer a full handle for powders which these have. I will switch a few out of these for travel to have the smaller ones I use and have a perfect set and then there will be some nice additions to my home makeup brush collection for blending when I contour. There is also a brush description for each one so you know what they are theoretically to be used for and a card that says if you are not happy for any reason to contact the company.

In case you were not aware, waxing is messy, even for a person who tries to be meticulous and keep things neat while involved with this task.<br />Let me take a moment to get this out before I go any further ... Bwahahahahaha<br />Ok.<br />I recently treated myself to a wax warmer because I wanted to wax larger areas and not have to run to the microwave frequently. Since the warmer pot is metal,the spatula can be scraped and kept reasonably clean during the waxing process. This also means that the wax on the spatula is not hardened and inhibiting the hot wax application (if you keep up with it).<br /><br />The Nitry Gritty...<br />- You are not wasting time! I cannot stress enough that time is something once spent, can’t be recovered. It’s precious!!<br />- You are not struggling to apply wax (as much as that’s possible)!<br />- This is small enough to allow quick, controlled applications in multiple areas while you wait for it to cool. Then rip away!<br />- Small enough to do parts of the face, but not under the eyebrows.<br />- Enough control to allow what you choose for size, direction, thickness and a little thicker pulling edge with minimal struggling. Tapered shape is very helpful. Not a flimsy product, very well made.<br />- Perfect to use with a wax warmer because the metal pot heats the metal spatula and makes cleaning it so much easier!<br /><br />If anyone is wondering, I used this with Kolua Wax (hard) sold here on Amazon.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I first purchased this soap at a Beauty Supply store near my house to use solely as a facial cleanser. I have a condition called Seborrheic Dermatitis, which causes raised, red, flaky rashes around my nose and mouth. It's similar to eczema and can be embarrassing, itchy, and uncomfortable. I treated it with medication prescribed by a dermatologist but after graduating from college, I suddenly found myself uninsured. I had heard about the effectiveness of both black soap and tea tree oil in treating various skin conditions like mine, so I was intrigued by a soap that provided both.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is how unprocessed it was compared to other black soap I've seen. This looks as if it's all natural. I've never used black soap before so I can't compare it to other products in anyway except appearance and price. Erzuli wasn't as pretty but it was more affordable.<br /><br />So the bottom line is...IT WORKS! It has completely tamed my seborrheic dermatitis as well or better than the steroidal medication I had been prescribed by my dermatologist, except without the cost and side effects.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />1) It feels odd. Perhaps, it's the tea tree oil but it feels as if there's some type of film over my face when I'm using it. It's not a bad feeling, just different than regular soap. At least in my head, it makes me feel as if my skin is actually getting moisturized.<br /><br />2) A little goes a very long way. This soap lasts forever....well at least if you only use it on your face like me. It lathers up like crazy. So don't waste it. I usually just rub it in my hands a couple times and than rub my hands together, which produces more than enough lather to wash my face. One bar has lasted months.<br /><br />3) It's messy. This is probably the biggest downside. The texture of this product is not like traditional soap. It becomes \"gummy\" after being exposed to water. I can literally take the bar of soap and bend it. It can actually get quite messy so I had to by a container to put the soap in which starts to look quite gross after a while.<br /><br />4) It tingles. I've heard black soap can tingle/burn a little, I definitely know tea tree oil can. So the two together means that if you leave it on your face for too long, it may start to burn a little. It's nothing too intense and for all I know, that might just mean it's working but I do try to let it sit on my face for only a minute or two before washing it off.<br /><br />5) The smell. There is not a strong tea tree oil smell, which for me is a plus. I wasn't sure what to expect but the scent is mild and inoffensive.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from a skin condition similar to mine. I just bought the pack of 2 here on Amazon, which was slightly more expensive than I had seen at the brick and mortar store but they were out of stock, and I couldn't bare the thought of running out. This is my new my secret weapon to having healthy looking skin. 5 stars!", "output": "Great for those suffering from seborrheic dermatitis or eczema"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "This is my review of the Ifill K-Cup user fill system.  All in all, the system delivers a steady clean means of filling K-Cup bodies with coffee.  Below I will compare my experience with 4 different scenarios for drinking coffee from a K-Cup system<br /><br />1. A standard dark roast K-cup cartridge.  This was a non-Keurig brand that contained 10.76 grams of coffee.  The coffee was of reasonable flavor, very convenient to use, and with no mess to make, the capsule is too complicated to recycle. Most expensive system to use $0.50 to more than $1.00 per serving.<br />2. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen.  -  User filled screen capsule.  Somewhat messy to fill, brews reasonable tasting coffee, but will leave a little sediment of ground in your cup.  Holds 10.20 grams of coffee. The system is a pain to clean out.  Least expensive system as the screen cup may be reused many times over.<br />3. Re-usable Echo Cup Screen with added paper filter – User filled screen capsule with disposable paper filter that fits inside of the plastic screen capsule.  Takes a while to get the hang of fitting the filter into the capsule.  The system holds a little less coffee at 10.06 grams of coffee. The drinkable coffee produced has very little sediment in your cup.  This system is a little bit easier to clean up, but not much.  The filter cup removes fairly easily, but there is still a fair amount of rinsing of the plastic capsule to get rid of the coffee grounds that are on the top of the capsule lid.  Slightly more expensive due to having to purchase filters.<br />4. The IFill Cup -  The is a user fillable cup single use system.  The cup has a preinstalled filter that does well producing sediment free coffee.  The attached lid is made of foil that is supported by a plastic ring that is hinged to the IFill cup body.  Each lid has a very effective gummy seal that works well during the brewing process to keep coffee ground contained within the IFill Cup. After filling with grounds, the caps stay sealed to the cup body and seem to be shelf stable for more than a week.  So just fill a bunch in one session and you off to caffeine heaven for another week.  There is some potential mess when originally filling new cups, but the ability to simple toss the used cup without any mess is a great plus.  A lightly filled cup held 10.86 grams of coffee.  At this fill there seem to be very few leaks when the brew process is working.  A very densely packed and somewhat overfilled cup held 14.72 grams.  In this situation there was some leaking from the cup lid at the water insertion point, but this cup was fill to the point of abuse.  I believe this system is more expensive than using an Echo Cup but is much less hassle to use.  The system is less expensive than using factory filled K-cups.  So if you want to know what is in your KCup every morning, and don’t mind setting down and filling new capsules with coffee every once in a while – this is your system!<br /><br />Can you reuse an IFIll cup?  I guess you could, but I am not sure that hassle of cleaning out, drying, and hoping that the single use gum seal would work well would be worth the bother.<br /><br />Can you recycle the product?  The company says yes, in reality I would guess that being most other KCup devices are not recyclable when the cup finally gets to the recycle guy for sorting, they are going to “Think KCup” and sort it directly into the trash.<br /><br />All in all, the IFill seems to be a great user fill KCup system.  Nice flavor from your own beans, easy setup, use and disposal of the product.  – I will be reordering more soon!", "output": "I Like I-Fill"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I thought this product was the answer to a problem....but it wasn't.<br /><br />TBH, its a great idea....but there are a couple flaws that need to be addressed. First, the claim that it will stick to all tub or shower surfaces is a fallacy that most people who own fiberglass tubs and showers should know. If you have a slippery tile or enamel floor to your bathtub or shower you will be good to go. But who wants to have a slippery shower floor?<br /><br />The second flaw is the curved piece that sits over the base.  If it had been designed properly, that piece would have been made from a bendable silicone so that if your foot hit it you wouldn't end up cursing a blue streak. But I am sure that was a money decision....easier to mold a one piece product than to have to assemble 2 pieces.<br /><br />As for the pumace breaking, I don't feel the product is meant to stand on with your full weight. My stone has not broken because I am careful not to stand on it.<br /><br />I can only give this 3 stars. I continue to use it, albeit carefully.

As I age I don’t mind the wrinkles or even the age spots. What I do mind is my sagging skin. Yes, having jowls terrifies me. This Star Mask was more comfortable than I thought it would be. You put a layer on and let it set between 20-30 minutes until it is completely dry. Usually, I can only stand to wear a mask 10 minutes, but this mask was so comfortable that I dozed off with it on. I woke up just in time to remove.<br /><br />Removal was a little difficult and made me wonder how tugging on my skin actually helped with firming, toning, and lifting. I’ve only had a chance to try this mask once so I cannot say that it’s going to keep the jowls at bay. What positive results I did have was my face was so soft and bright after removing this mask. Best of all my overly sensitive skin wasn’t irritated in the least. It is a mask that I am going to incorporate into my skincare routine and hopefully, the jowls never appear.  You need such a small amount of this mask that the 1.7 fl oz jar should last you through many maskings.  Also, the jar is so pretty it can sit on your vanity and no one will be the wiser that you have a black glittery gel inside.<br /><br />The only thing I didn’t like was the glitter was uncomfortable during application. Some of the larger sized glitters would catch and scratch your skin until they laid down. Not to the point of marks or blood. Just an annoyance.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a reduced price for testing purposes. .", "output": "Unique Mask for All Ages"}

Since I rely on reviews from Amazon, I'm including mine to help others.<br />My colors are the first photo-Shady and Starburst.<br />My first attempt was with Shady and I did a great job on my left hand, but didn't smooth out the right enough. It held up well, but I only got a week out of it because I couldn't deal with the bad job I'd done on my right hand.<br />The second photo is the second time I did my nails and first time I used Starburst. Glitter is more forgiving.  I realized that with two coats of the color, you could still see the white of my nail through it. The second time I used this color, I used a white base (Fresh Cotton from Sally's). This second time is the grid photo with the purple/silver.<br /><br />From start to finish (with bare nails) this takes about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Advice:<br />1-Watch YouTube tutorials. All systems have different instructions, so they might not all apply to your kit. Keep that in mind as you watch them.<br />2-Let the dip dry before you brush off the excess. I didn't do that before, but employed that advice my third time (purple/silver photo) and it was a better experience.<br />3-Don't do this without a good buffer. A plain old nail file ain't gonna cut it!<br />4-I bought nail clips to hold the acetone-soaked cotton on my nails and it works way better than foil. I can do all my nails at once.<br />5-Before stating dip polish, after washing hands, wipe nails with alcohol pad. It gets all the oils off your nails. This is good advice for regular polish, too.", "output": "Satisfied and Recommend"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "SUMMARY:<br />I found these blades to be a much lower cost, good-excellent quality alternative to stock Gillette blades.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE?  Note, however, I always perform proper cleaning maintenance after each shave.  To wit: I brush off the blades using the tooth brush bristles to get in between the blades, then blow on it a few times to clear off most of any remaining water droplets.  This greatly retards oxidation and corrosion of the blade edges.  For anyone groaning right now, that &#34;whole big process&#34; takes all of 10 seconds!  That's fast by any measure.<br /><br />LIFE:<br />Using the above standard methodology of use, I got just as long a use per blade as stock Gillette's ... roughly 2 months per blade ..  before there is a any hint of snagging, rather than cutting, my hairs.<br /><br />FEEL:<br />I found the slightly larger size of the blade head felt a bit odd but only on the very 1st shave.  It soon felt good, even reassuring, as it provided a broader surface to go over my skin.<br /><br />CUTS?<br />One reviewer said they cut him easily.  I, too, have been cut, but it was by the stock Gillette blades. Frankly, it's going to happen with any blade ... eventually.  Some units of any make blades will be slightly off on rare occasion or have inconsistent edges than can cut or scratch.  Then, there's the matter of user technique.<br /><br />After 4-5 decades on this earth, a shaver should get a sense of their skin hairs, how they slant, how sensitive the skin is underneath, and, most importantly, how tough their skin has become.  These things are even more critical for women who are forced to shave areas infinitely more sensitive than those of men. Mature adults usually have tougher skin from loss of collagen, sun degradation, and for simply having shaved many 1,000's of times.  Younger shavers tend to have sensitive skin and are less attuned to the proper angles at which to pull the shaver to deal with their skin profile.<br /><br />I took the above side trip to highlight that for some, the minutest difference in blades could cause some shavers to cut themselves - not necessarily due to blade defects or construction style but, perhaps, simply because they have not spent as much time adapting their technique to a new blade as they did to their previous one.  That is, days or weeks versus many years!  Remember how many times new shavers cut themselves when 1st shaving?  The same experiential curve applies to those changing blade models - not matter their age or shaving experience level.<br /><br />VALUE:<br />So far, for me, these low cost blades are a tremendous value. Plus I bought a 5 pack for $0.97 on a 1-time CVS sale. Then bought another at the regular (way cheaper than OEM) price of $16 for 10.  So, I'm good for another 1.25 years at 2 months per blade.<br /><br />COST PER SHAVE:<br />Excluding the clearance price I got on a 5-pack, the $16 price for 10 = $1.60 each.  With a mean time to replacement of 2 months (for me), that equates to $1.60 / 60 days = $0.0267 cents per shave or roughly $0.81 / month or $9.74 / year.<br /><br />BLADE AGING PROFILE:<br />The &#34;newness&#34; feeling and sharpness wore off at about the same rate as do my Gillette blades.<br />To wit: 1-5 shaves = feels like new using 2-3 strokes/pass<br />  5-20 = 3-4 strokes/pass<br />20-40 = 4-5 strokes/pass<br />40-60 = 5-6 strokes/pass<br />Only then do I toss and replace unless, of course, I come upon a blade that seems to have aged quicker for whatever reason.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />They look, feel, and age not much differently than Gillette blades and cost 50-75% less.  Look for CVS in-store at your local branch then check Amazon to ensure you find the lowest cost.", "output": "Low cost, quality OEM replacement"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "The Bouquet Garni Fragranced Body Shower gel’s most prominent characteristic is its scent.  It definitely has the airy, ethereal fragrance of a delicate powder, leaving a pleasant and gentle scent wafting after washing—no additional cologne or perfume needed Though it takes between (an estimated) 1-2 tablespoons of the gel to get sufficient lathering action, once it does, it cleans well and does result in that wonderful fragrance post showering.  One claim from the promo text I do somewhat question is that of “perfectly moisturized skin.” I would have to say that any moisturizing properties are just average, not exceptional. Part of the evaluation criteria is assessing thickness and packaging. Thickness is exactly what I would expect it to be, remaining where it’s poured lying atop a washcloth and neither running off nor penetrating the cloth until appropriate action is taken. As for the packaging, the design appeal of colors and shape get high marks. Unfortunately, my bottle is one where the pump would never fully unlock, dispensing only a minute amount at a time, which is both impractical and extremely frustrating. I’ve had to remove the pump and pour, which is much less efficient. Generally, this product would be toward the outside price range of what I would consider, but I do think its exceptional fragrance makes it worthwhile purchase both for a gift or for personal use knowing it will result in a clean, soft fragrance requiring no additional products.", "output": "Exceptional fragrance for consumers who like airy florals!"}

There is a small mirror on the inside of the lid. I appreciate that the container latches securely, so bits of loose powder don't get all over the place in my makeup bag. I would, however, appreciate if they found a way to fit a tiny applicator somewhere in the underside of the container. I had to dig one out from my makeup drawer.<br /><br />This is an eyeshadow duo with a slightly pinker, and a more taupe-y shade. As you can see from the pic, these colors are very, very subtle on paler skin like mine. However, there is a nice shimmer to them that makes it stand out a bit.  I like that the eyeshadow is pretty clingy and didn't get all over my face when I was applying it. It is long-lasting--at the end of the work day, it still is quite noticeable when I look in the mirror.<br /><br />Currently, the eyeshadow is retailing at about $22.

Sun screen is an important part of skin care routine, so it is nice to have the BB cream and sun screen combined.<br /><br />CONS<br />-This BB cream might be too dewy for oily skin.

It felt really nice on my skin. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day after using in the morning.<br /><br />None of the products irritated my skin. I have dry skin with some rosacea.

I bought these on a whim, since Amazon was offering them at $20 for 10 masks, which usually cost $35 in Korea. IOPE is somewhat of a luxury brand so I decided to try it. I've been scratching my head trying to figure out what the ingredient is, but something in these masks are whitening my skin! :D The mask itself is gauze-like and has tiny speckles in it, but it's not an impurity or defect, it's embedded in the fabric itself. The aluminum packaging is crinkly, but IOPE explains that it's due to their sterilization process (they sterilize the masks in the packaging).<br /><br />I've tried many many Korean masks, but I've never had one whiten my skin the way this one does. It whitens by making my pores disappear. At first I thought some kind of white substance must be filling in my pores, but the essence is clear and even if I rub the product off my skin, the pores are still gone (not visible). Either my pores are getting super cleaned or super tightened. I'm excited either way by these masks. I don't have acne or sensitive skin, but I do have large pores from harsh acne treatments 10 years ago. These masks make my skin look like snow without those ugly blackheads showing. I can't stop staring at the mirror when I take the mask off, it's the one time I can admire an evenly-toned whitened skin.<br /><br />There's a ton of essence in each mask by the way (I mean a TON) so I like to pour it in a spray bottle and save it for mist for makeup application. Gave me bright, dewy skin after BB! :)", "output": "Whitens My Skin!!"}

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I love containers and was looking for something to hold about half a cup of nuts, candy, etc. for taking in my lunches. I try to organize stuff on the weekends so I can just grab and go every morning while packing my lunch for work.<br />These containers are going to be great for my purpose, I can tell already! They hold a tad more than half a cup (I poured 1/2 cup water in one to test it and there was still a small amount of room above the water line). The included liner is fantastic. I only tested one container so far, but it was the one I put 1/2 cup of water in. I put the liner on the container, screwed the top on and turned it upside down, sideways, and shook it. No leakage! Very impressive. I probably won't use liquid in these containers but it's nice to know they don't leak if I find a liquid I want to put in them. I might just take yogurt in them!<br /><br />I've included pictures so you can see the size, how well they are made and how they came packaged. There was bubble wrap around the package of containers, then they were in plastic under the bubble wrap also. I had to get my scissors out to get into the bubble wrap, it was on securely.<br />The containers themselves seem to be a medium thick plastic, definitely not flimsy. There is nothing on them to indicate the type of plastic they are made of, but Houseables says they are made of polypropylene and safe for spices, cooking oils, etc. The Livestrong website states &#34;Polypropylene containers do not leach harmful chemicals into foods or liquids. They commonly contain yogurt, medicine, drinks, ketchup and medicines.&#34;<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the included liners, as I imagined they would be the same type of liners you get in the top of some medicine bottles - a thin piece of waterproof paper that won't last long. The liners in these containers are great! I've included a picture of them as well.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review but I feel they are totally worth the full price of $11.99. I was planning on buying them anyway and was pleased to get a discount. If I didn't like them, I would tell you that too. A review is no good if it's not honest. If they break easily or something else happens that causes my opinion of them to change, I'll update my review to reflect that.<br /><br />One of the photos has a green [[ASIN:B00FP2RMUY Gotubb 3-Pack, Multi, Medium]] on top of these, so if you are familiar with Gotubbs you can judge the size of the Houseables jars a bit better. I love my Gotubbs and how they open with one hand, but they do cost a lot more than these Houseables jars. If you are looking for a lot of storage for a low price, this is the product to get!<br /><br />**Update** I'm still using these containers and they are still as great as ever! I am watching my weight and these help me keep track of my food intake and make it easy to grab and go with a premeasured amount of food. They hold a single serving size of wheat thins perfectly, are handy for a scoop of slim fast powder and two teaspoons of Benefiber mixed together (I use the included liners for this application), hold a serving of Hershey Kisses and come in handy for a lot more! I love to prepackage this stuff then grab and go in the mornings. Well worth the money, even at full price.", "output": "I love containers and was looking for something to hold about ..."}

I am primarily avoiding fluoride and other ingredients I can't pronounce just for general purposes, not to address any mouth / gum issues.  It is quite gritty, more like diatomacious earth rather than baking soda.  Even a little grittier than the polish product the dentist uses after your cleaning is completed.  The all natural flavor is quite strong, which I like to think is doing great things for my gums, but some would find it too much.  There is zero foaming, just mixing with the saliva produced while brushing, and I haven't mastered the spilling out of my mouth during the brushing process . . I have to make sure to lean over the sink bowl!  It does leave my mouth and teeth clean and refreshed, it just isn't all that pleasant to use.

{"instruction": "Please generate a summary based on the text below.", "input": "I can't think when I last rated any product with all five stars but this one gets them!<br /><br />I have always used \"foil\" shavers over the past 30 or so years and they have varied widely in the quality of shave. Only one would I have rated at the top for shave quality that approached blade shaving and that one was purchased about 24 years ago. I never gave multi-head rotary shavers much thought...until this one. This shaver beats EVERY electric shaver I haver ever owned or tried for shave quality...even \"dry\" (without using any kind of pre-shave). With a pre-shave lotion it is even better. This is a great on-the-road shaver to keep in your car for those super-quick erasures of 6-o'clock shadows.<br /><br />This thing is super quiet. It doesn't \"buzz\" but the sound it does make is a very quiet one that makes you think it is running at a slow speed...yet it races right through a 3-day growth as fast as you can \"mow\" your face. The rotor housing pops right off and you just shake the stubs out if you have been using dry or only with pre-shave. If you use it in the shower...well, rinse it off in there!<br /><br />Battery life so far has been unexpectedly good. It has a countdown charge timer built into the on-off switch that starts at 60 (supposed minutes) but after a good estimated half hour of shaving mine only ticked down to about 43 before I plugged it in to my laptop to charge. It only comes with a USB charging corder (it's proprietary at one end so don't lose it!) that can plug into any power-providing standard USB port. Many hotels now have USB charging ports on their bathroom outlets and you even find them on things like inexpensive power strips. Of course, you can purchase a standalone USB charger...but I see no need in my case give this thing seems to just \"sip\" power and would likely last a multi-week business trip without the need to charge.<br /><br />Its flip out trimmer is rather smallish but gets the job done and trims very closely. Works as well as any I have tried/owned.<br /><br />I don't see a real downside to this shaver. I don't know (haven't checked) where you might find additional rotary blades if you need them but the shaver is so inexpensive you could buy five or six whole shavers for the price of other \"mid range\" rotaries I have tried that don't give as good a shave.<br /><br />Unless you are a real brand-loyalist or your current shaver gives what you consider a \"perfect\" this is THE ONE TO GET.", "output": "Super shave quality, deceptively quiet, and goes forever on a charge."}
